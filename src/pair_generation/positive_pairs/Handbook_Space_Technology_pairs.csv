This presupposes a preliminary understanding of the properties and costs of the potential system segments including spacecraft, launcher and ground segment.",True,3
What process follows the initial assessment of a project to refine mission architecture and subsystem design?,"After the first estimation of feasibility and costs the mission concept is revised. If a stable mission con- cept (or several apparently equal mission concepts) is obtained after a number of iterations, the mission architecture can be built up by developing the sub- system design from the subsystem requirements.

After stabilizing the spacecraft’s condition there is a commissioning and test phase during which atten- tion is mostly on the configuration of the payload. ,True,2
What happens to operation effort after several years of mission duration due to component deterioration?,"In this phase the operation effort is still rather high compared to the subsequent routine operations phase. In this phase, sometimes lasting several years, only a fraction of the initial operations crew of the first two phases is required, especially if operation takes place in a so-called multimission environment, in which several spacecraft are con- trolled simultaneously. With increasing mission duration the operation effort also increases again after a few years as components and subsystems subject to deterioration fail. ",True,3
What is the term for the operational profile characterized by increasing effort and unpredictable failures throughout a spacecraft's lifetime?,"Typically, attitude control and power are affected most seriously. In general, the number of unpredictable failures increases with lifetime, which can lead to the de- stabilization of the entire spacecraft.

One is based on the con- centration of electrons as a function of altitude; the other is based on the influence of the Earth’s magnetic field on the ionized components of the air.,True,2
How does the mass of charged particles affect their response to a magnetic field force?,Charged particles that move across the magnetic field are influenced by a force perpendicular to the magnetic field and to their velocity. Due to their smal- ler mass electrons are more influenced by this force than are ions traveling at the same velocity. The pro- portion of ionized particles increases with height. Up to an altitude of 70 km the share of ionized particles is so small that the neutral gas particles take the ionized gas particles with them. ,True,2
What generates electric fields in a region where ions move freely with neutral gas but electrons are restricted?,"Above there is a region where the ions completely follow the movement of the neut- ral gas particles, while the electrons are hindered in their movement across the magnetic field. As a result, electric fields are generated (dynamo layer).. ",True,2
What primarily drives the motion of ionized particles in the area above 130 km?,"The density of the neutral gas decreases above a height of 130 km, which makes collisions between ions and neutral gas particles very rare. The motion of all io- nized particles is mainly driven by the Earth’s magneticfield. This region is called the magnetosphere. Charged",True,3
What phenomenon results in particles being trapped within magnetic field lines near the poles?,"particles can hardly leave this region because they are guided along the magnetic field lines they interact with. At the poles they are reflected back and forth and there- fore held captive in the magnetic field lines they travel along. This phenomenon creates the hot, thin plasma which fills the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere itself is circumferentially flooded with the cold, dense plasma of the solar wind traveling at supersonic velo- city. ",True,3
What effect does the solar wind have on the magnetosphere during daytime compared to nighttime?,"The solar wind is not able to penetrate the outer border of the magnetosphere, called the magnetopause, due to the Earth’s strong magnetic field. It is forced to reduce its velocity at the so-called bow shock to a subsonic value and to stream around the magnetos- phere. At this point, the solar wind with its high kinetic pressure compresses the magnetosphere on the day side of the Earth. By contrast, the magnetosphere on the night side of the Earth is formed into a tail extending beyond the orbit of the Moon.. ",True,3

How does the density of an ionizable gas change with elevation in Earth's gravity field?,"The density of the ionizable gas decreases with increasing height in the gravity field of the Earth. The intensity of the ionizable radiation, however, is highest at the top. As radiation is absorbed and used for ionization, the radiation intensity decreases in the downward direction. The production rate of ions is proportional to the quantities mentioned above and therefore has a strong maximum at medium altitudes. Because different gases exist within the air, different ionization layers of gas are created at different heights.. ",True,3

This dipole is tilted by 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.,True,3
What limits the Earth's magnetic field to a finite volume in space?,"If the Earth were located in space without any particles and without any electromagnetic field, the di- pole structure of the magnetic field close to the planet would be preserved even far from the Earth. Based on what is known today, this is not the case. The magnetic field of the Earth is embedded in the particle stream of the Sun, called the solar wind. At the same time it overlaps with the interplanetary magnetic field. This interaction limits the magnetic field to a finite volume called the magnetosphere (see Figure 2.1.8).. ",True,3

What feature of the Earth's magnetosphere extends significantly beyond the lunar orbit and resembles a comet's tail?,"especially on the pressure of the solar wind. On the side away from the Sun the magnetosphere is widely spread and forms a cylindrical body. This region is called the magnetospheric tail because of its simila- rity to the tail of a comet. The length of the tail is not exactly known and most likely quite variable.

What types of forces are considered in the model for a charged particle in a magnetic field?,"Most particles populating the magnetosphere are ionized and therefore charged. Additional forces act on these charged particles moving inside the magnetic field. They are a function of the velocity of the charged particle. To describe this effect a balance of forces on a single particle is assumed. In this very simple model the following forces are taken into account: the inertial force F;, the velocity-dependent magnetic field force F,, and other external forces that are independent of velocity F;.

What approach is suggested to manage the complexity of solving Equation 2.1.9 regarding external magnetic fields?,"The solution of Equation 2.1.9 is much more difficult and depends significantly on the configuration of the outer magnetic field. Therefore, it is helpful to break down the total movement into single components. In fact, this is often possible since these different single components are on different time scales and can therefore be treated independently. As a result, the following special cases occur, among others:. ",True,3

What phenomenon occurs when charged particles move within a magnetic field that varies in strength?,A magnetic field perpendicular to the movement of the particles in response to gravity causes the charged particles to gyrate along the magnetic field lines.

What is a significant advantage of reduced gravitational influence on mechanical designs in spacecraft?,"On a spacecraft traveling in space without any influence of either internal (propulsion) or external (atmospheric drag) forces, there is weightlessness as a result of the free fall within the gravitational field.

What method is used to reduce uncontrolled movement of liquids in spacecraft storage tanks during launch and reentry?,"The highest structu- ral loads to be encountered are those arising during launch and reentry. One drawback of weightlessness on-board a spacecraft is the uncontrolled sloshing of liquids (e.g., propellants) inside the storage tanks.

The atmospheric drag expected during a mission can be calculated; it is a function of the cross-sectional area of a spacecraft, its starting date, its orbit and its inclination. The atomic oxygen ratio within the residual at- mosphere creates an aggressive environment for the material of a spacecraft. ",True,4
What phenomenon occurs due to the high velocity of atoms impacting a surface?,"This is not only the result of its chemical responsiveness, but also and more likely a combination of the latter with the high rela- tive velocity of about 8 km/s with which the atoms hit the surface.

How does the angular velocity of a satellite vary in elliptical orbits compared to circular orbits?,"According to Kepler’s second law, the angular velo- city of the satellite in an elliptical orbit is not constant.

Only for circular orbits are the true anomaly and the mean anomaly identical at all times.

By contrast, a high degree of noise means that the estimated orbit is always determined by the newest measurements and evidences a large statistical uncertainty. The “memory” of the filter can therefore be controlled by the choice of process noise and thus be adapted to the obtaining circumstances. Usually, however, a series of simulations and instinct are re- quired to optimally use a Kalman filter.. ",True,4
What principle guides the measurement refinement in the algorithm mentioned?,"For the most part, the measurement update of the Kalman filter is equivalent to the estimation with a priori information described in the last section.

What term describes the synchronization of a satellite's orbital period with Earth's rotation for consistent ground tracking?,A large number of satellites in LEO regularly monitor and map the Earth’s surface across a diverse spectral range. Here it is normal to synchronize the orbital period with the rotation of the Earth so that after a certain period of time the satellite flies over the same ground track.

What effect does a maneuver in the ascending or descending node have on inclination?,"Therefore, an exclusive change in inclination results only from maneuvers made directly in the ascending (or descending) node.",True,3
What are the primary reasons for the need for correction maneuvers in orbital missions?,"Even after reaching the nominal mission orbit, smaller correction maneuvers are required fairly regularly to compensate for natural orbital perturba- tions. This is first and foremost related to the effects of drag, which leads to a slow decrease in altitude and thereby to a change in the orbital period. As a result, the ground track of remote sensing satellites is shifted, which can usually only be tolerated within a margin of about 1 km.. ",True,3

How can a satellite's ground track drift be corrected to return to the nominal position?,"ay=-CyA pon (2.2.78) The linear decrease in the semiaxis then leads to a continuous reduction of the time between consecutive equatorial crossings and thus to a quadratic shift in the ascending node to the east (Figure 2.2.23). If the ground track of a satellite has shifted too far from the nominal position, this drift can be stopped and reversed by a maneuver to raise the orbit. Ideally this maneuver is planned so that the apex of the node drift lies at the western window boundary, thus maximizing the time between maneuvers.. ",True,4
What factors can cause variations in atmospheric density impacting satellite motion?,In practice the assumption of constant at- mospheric drag is not sufficient. The density of the atmosphere can undergo significant variations depending on the solar activity. The actual motion of the ascending satellite thus diverges from the idealized parabolic form and must be corrected with additional or alternative maneuvers. This is illustrated using the example of the TOPEX satellite in Figure 2.2.24.. ,True,2
How has GPS technology impacted orbital control systems in recent satellite missions?,"The interest in on-board orbital control has grown with the availability of GPS-based navigati- onal data on many remote sensing satellites.

How does the location of a geostationary satellite influence its acceleration along the orbit?,"e The irregular form of the Earth causes a slow ac- celeration of a geostationary satellite along its orbit. The magnitude and sign of this acceleration depend on the satellite’s location above the equator. For ex- ample, maximum values of +0.002°/ d’ are reached over South America, East Africa and Indonesia.

How does radiation pressure influence the long-term motion of the eccentricity vector in the planar coordinates?,"e Due to gravitational perturbations from the Earth, Sun and Moon, the eccentricity vector ex- hibits periodic variations around its mean.

The difference in flow topology between both solutions is self-evident. A characteristic feature of high enthalpy hypersonic flows past blunt bodies is that compared to the frozen flow the shock stand- off distance is significantly reduced due to chemical reactions and the associated increase in shock layer density.

During the design of reentry vehicles it is important to ensure that the maxima of structural and thermal loads do not appear at the same flight altitude. ",True,3
What are the two trajectories that limit a vehicle's possible reentry corridor?,"For reasons of economy, the reentry flights realized up to now are based on vehicles without propulsion systems.

The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the one with the shallowest allowable angle of entry at the atmospheric interface required to prevent skip-off. ",True,2
What type of flight path is characterized by the spacecraft generating no lift during reentry?,"The undershoot trajecto- ry is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory. Two basically different kinds of reentry trajectories used so far can be distinguished.

What is a drawback of using blunt capsule configurations for space transportation systems in terms of trajectory capabilities?,"Space transportation systems which fly nearly ballistic trajectories utilize blunt capsule configurations, ab- lative thermal protection systems and parachutes for the landing approach. A disadvantage of this type of trajectory is that the cross-range capability, namely the range normal to the orbiting plane, is limited. On the other hand, lift-generating reentry configurations allow for a significantly less steep trajectory, which simultaneously leads to a reduction of the maximum heat fluxes (see Figure 2.3.7).

What influence does the lift/drag ratio have on the timing of deorbit maneuvers during reentry?,"As mentioned earlier, an important parameter for the characterization of reentry trajectories is the lift/drag ratio. In addition to the flight range and cross-range capability, the selection of the possible point in time to commence the deorbit maneuver, that is to begin the reentry phase, is determined by this parameter. Particularly from a safety point of view, this is an important issue. In Figure 2.3.11, the waiting time between two consecutive possible deorbit maneuvers preparatory to reentry and landing at a predefined location on Earth is given as a function of the lift/drag ratio and the orbit inclination. ",True,3
What minimum lift/drag ratio is needed for a spacecraft to achieve cross-range based on its orbit radius?,"The waiting time is drastically reduced with increasing lift/drag ratio. Spacecraft with low lift/drag ratio — primarily capsule configurations —are able to return to a defined landing point only once in 24 hours. With a lift/drag ratio of C,/ Cy~ 2, the Space Shuttle Orbiter has several opportunities to return to Earth in the course of a day. In order to be able to reach any point on Earth from a given orbit, the cross-range based on the radius of the orbit must be at least m /2.

What is the challenge of achieving high lift/drag ratios in reentry vehicles?,"Reentry vehicles with large lift/drag ratios are difficult to realize because they would exhibit a low volumetric efficiency (ratio of surface to volume).

"What happens to flow particles normal to a surface when they collide with it, according to the flow model?","When this is assumed, the force exerted by the flow on a surface is caused solely by the kinetic energy of the flow particles.

What specific surface of a reentry vehicle contributes most to lift during hypersonic flight?,"Neglecting viscous effects, the forces acting on a complete configuration are determined by integra- tion of the wall pressure over the entire surface. A characteristic property of hypersonic flight is that in contrast to transonic and low supersonic flight, the lower surface is particularly responsible for the generation of lift. This is due to the high pressures occurring there. Consequently, an inclined flat plate would in practice be the most effective lower surface for a reentry vehicle. ",True,3

How does the nose shape affect pressure drag in supersonic and hypersonic flight?,"In contrast to the considerations related to the heat flux into the structure of a reentry vehicle, viscous effects play an inferior role related to the aerodynamic properties of such vehicles. Regarding the pressure drag, fundamental differences between hypersonic and subsonic flight can be identified. In subsonic flight, the pressure drag is significantly determined by the size of the wake, whereas for supersonic and hypersonic vehicles the shape of the nose represents the determining factor.

What design feature is emphasized for drag reduction in vehicles intended for subsonic flight?,"From a drag reduction point of view, vehicles designed for subsonic flight are equipped with tapered trailing edges, and supersonic and hypersonic configurations with pointed leading edges. These considerations demonstrate the basic dependencies and are predominantly valid for hyper- sonic aircraft designed to achieve a certain flight range. It should be noted that, due to the thermal balance and the thermal limits of currently applied materi- als, blunt-shaped nose parts are chosen for reentry vehicles. ",True,2
What wing shape is known to provide a compromise for both low and hypersonic speeds?,"Another aspect is related to the shape of the wing. Straight leading edges are preferred in subsonic ight, because they generate lower induced drag and higher lift. Hypersonic vehicles with high lift/drag ratio, however, exhibit swept-back geometries with sharp leading edges. The delta wing shape with round leading edges, as used on the Space Shuttle Orbiter, represents a compromise which allows sufficient lift to be generated at low speed, to achieve a satisfactory ift/drag ratio at hypersonic speeds and to meet the requirements of thermal balance [2.3.2], [2.3.15].

How can one achieve higher Mach numbers in ground tests without matching flight speeds?,"An aspect which exemplifies the partial simu- lation is that one possibility to increase the Mach number in ground-based facilities is to reduce the free stream temperature, that is the free stream speed of sound.

What high-temperature phenomena occur in the shock layer during hypersonic flight that cannot be replicated in ground tests?,"However, as pointed out in Section 2.3.3, one characteristic of hypersonic flight at high Mach number is that the kinetic energy of the flow is large enough that, in the shock layer of reentry vehicles, for instance, high-temperature ef- fects such as vibrational excitation or dissociation of the fluid molecules is induced.

What are the two categories of objects sharing space with spacecraft?,"Spacecraft are not alone in space during their mis- sions; they share it with meteoroids and man made orbiting objects, called space debris or orbital debris. This poses the possibility of unwanted collisions. Because of the high speed of impact (10km/s or more) even small particles can cause substantial damage or the loss of a spacecraft. While meteoroids are of natural origin, space debris has been created by the space activities of the last 50 years. ",True,2
What measures must be taken to protect spacecraft from external objects in low Earth orbits?,"The risk posed by space debris is growing continuously and for manned missions in low Earth orbits (LEOs) it is already higher than that resulting from meteoroids. As a consequence, nowadays manned spacecraft have to be protected against impacting objects. In the future this will also be necessary for unmanned missions. Furthermore, future missions have to be planned so that they will not contribute to an uncontrolled increase of space debris.. ",True,3

What consequences arise from the firing of solid rocket motors regarding particulate matter?,"The firing of solid rocket motors (SRMs) produces residues like slag and dust. Fragmentation as a result of explosions or collisions leads to an increased number of particles.

Impacts of small particles create ejection material, and so on. Figure 2.4.1 presents the different orbital debris par- ticles in LEO and their typical sizes. ",True,3
What natural processes contribute to the reduction of space debris particles in orbit?,"Contrary to the above-mentioned mechanism of space debris creation, there are natural decay processes like atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure that slowly reduce the number of particles. They change the orbit of the objects until they reenter the Earth’s atmosphere [2.4.7]. However, these mechanisms are not able to compensate for the creation of particles, thus in total the number of particles increases.. ",True,3

What measures are being considered to mitigate the risk of collisions in space amidst growing debris?,"According to Rex [2.4.7], uncontrolled growth in the amount of space debris will make safe operation in space impossible in the future.

What is the purpose of conducting delta-v maneuvers for space missions?,"Up to now, explosions have mainly contributed to the generation of space debris. To avoid these in future, the remaining fuel should be released from inactive upper stages and satellites. This is called passivation and is already being done. However, if the passivated objects remain in space, the possibility of collision is still present. To improve this situation, stages and satellites should be deorbited at the end of their mission by distinct “delta-v” maneuvers. ",True,3

What notable shield concept was proposed by Whipple in 1947 for spacecraft protection?,"The simplest protection concept is to increase the wall thickness of the outside structure of the spacecraft. However, that leads very quickly to an unacceptable increase in structural mass. The introduction of a protective shield in front of the structure is substan- tially more effective. This was suggested in 1947 by Whipple [2.4.17], which led to the Whipple shield or the bumper shield. Its efficiency results from the fact that an incoming particle is destroyed upon impact. ",True,2
What happens to fragments when they heat up between two walls?,"The fragments heat up and may melt or even vaporize [2.4.18], [2.4.19].

What type of structure is suggested for load-carrying purposes in spacecraft design to minimize additional costs?,"The concepts described above are particularly intended for the protection of manned spacecraft in order to ensure sufficient security for the crew. For unmanned spacecraft with mostly smaller surfaces and less stringent safety requirements, it is sufficient to plan for protection against particles of 2-3 mm diameter. The additional costs for protection should be as low as possible. A meaningful solution is to design the load-carrying structure as a sandwich structure. ",True,2
What are the efficiency differences between sandwich structures and double walls in terms of particle cloud expansion?,"This not only provides good structural characteristics and low mass, but also offers better protection than monolithic structures. Compared to a double wall the sandwich is, however, less efficient, since the core reduces the expansion of the particle cloud between the face sheets. Another option is multilayer insulation (MLI), which is introduced for passive temperature control in front of the structure and behaves like a very thin protective shield. ",True,3

The velocity rangeFigure 2.4.18: Double-wall structure: the effect of impact velocity.,True,3
What happens to the particle as the velocity increases beyond a critical speed?,"is divided into three regions with different behaviors (Figure 2.4.18). At low velocities the pressure develo- ping when the shield is perforated is not sufficient to destroy the particle. There is practically no protective effect. Starting from a critical speed, which depends on the material combination of the shield and the particle, the particle is destroyed. This process in- creases with increasing velocity. ",True,3
What occurs to particles and their fragments at velocities above a specific threshold?,"The necessary rear wall thickness decreases at the same time. Above a second critical velocity the particle and its fragments are heated to such an extent that they begin to melt or evaporate.

What are the primary components of space transportation systems?,2/25/09 11:04:25 AM CHO3.indd 114 2/24/09 3:16:40 PM3 Space Transportation Systems,True,3
What principle underlies the operation of all current launch vehicles?,"Scientific research and commercial space utilization require transportation systems which carry spacecraft and their payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. The physical basis of all launch vehicles used today is the repulsion principle, according to which any change of motion is produced by corresponding opposed forces. This forward impulse, also called thrust, is developed by rocket engines.",True,3
Identify the two types of substances needed in a launch vehicle's thrust chamber for generating high-temperature gases.,"By following this principle, the construction of a launch vehicle can be regarded as simple, but seen from the standpoint of technical implementation it is quite complex. Its essential components are propellant tanks, engines, structures, navigation and guidance equipment, separation systems, attitude control systems and flight data monitoring systems. The two propellants, the fuel and the oxidizer, are ignited in the thrust chamber where they produce very high-temperature gases by chemical reactions and then expand through a nozzle, thereby generating thrust.. ",True,3
What distinguishes solid propellants from liquid propellants in terms of combustion control?,"For propulsion, solid or liquid propellants are used, in special cases also in combination. In the case of solid propellants, the combustion components are mixed and cast in a cylindrical mold. Once ignited, the whole block burns continuously; interruption of the combustion process is not possible. In the case of liquid propellants, the fuel and oxidizer are fed separately into the combustion chamber, where they undergo chemical reaction. The flow can be con- trolled or even interrupted with the possibility of reignition.. ",True,3
What were the initial purposes of space transportation systems developed in the latter half of the twentieth century?,"Space transportation systems were developed in the second half of the twentieth century to explore extraterrestrial space, the Moon and the planets of the Solar System. Soon Earth-related applications for satellites also started, including weather forecasting, communications, Earth observation and human space flight, culminating in 1969 with the first landing on the Moon.",True,2
What are the main factors influencing the development of launch vehicles?,"Launch vehicles have been developed from a number of different motivations. First, there are the national strategic and sovereign aspects, such as achieving autonomous access to space. But market forecasts as well as the technological standards of industry and research projects are also decisive for the conception of space transportation systems. The launch vehicles currently used meet the demand for worldwide spacecraft transport. ",True,2
What is the average number of launches per year for satellites weighing 3-5 tonnes?,"They have different payload capacities regarding mass and volume and are offered at different launch costs. On average, in the present decade 20 satellites in the class of 3-5 tonnes are launched annually. To this sum approximately the same number of small satellites in the class up to 1 tonne can be added. The transport costs are in the order of 15 000 euros (20000 US dollars) per kilogram of payload; the reliability of reaching the predicted orbit is higher than 95%.. ",True,2
What element is no longer considered critical for future lunar and Mars exploration missions?,"For future space programs such as lunar and Mars exploration, the transportation system is no longer regarded as the critical technological element, presuming that these programs can be executed with well-tested and qualified launch vehicles.

What are the two main challenges for future space transport systems as outlined in the context?,"the Space Shuttle, which will be discontinued after 2010, today’s vehicles are not designed as reusable vehicles qualified for human space flight, but are one-way or expendable vehicles. For each launch, a new vehicle is necessary. This results in two challenges for future space transportation systems: first, reusability and, second, human space transport qualification, with possibly a combination of both requirements. ",True,3
What factors could lead to significant advancements in space transportation technology?,"Basic research in transportation systems has been going on for many years, particularly in the fields of take-off and landing capability, reentry, mass reduction and reusability. Technological breakthroughs can, however, only be expected in the case of drastically increased demand for space applications.. ",True,3
What are the main categories covered in the introduction to space transportation systems?,"The sections of this chapter will give a detailed introduction to the theory, technology and design of present and future space transportation systems, launch vehicle stages and subsystems. The propulsion requirements for various space missions, different propulsion systems, as well as the development and qualification philosophies for components and com- plete transportation systems, will be described. Finally, requirements and implementation of launch sites and ground facilities will also be treated.. ",True,3
Who are the authors of the specified work?,Jens Lassmann and Michael H. Obersteiner,True,0
What percentage of the take-off mass can be refurbished in the partially reusable Space Shuttle system?,"The requirements for launch systems (rockets) deviate noticeably from those for other land, water or air vehicles. A substantial difference is that today’s sys- tems are not reusable, or reusable only to a very low extent. Even for the partially reusable Space Shuttle system, only the orbiter is refurbished for reuse, and it amounts to only 3% of the take-off mass. The reason is that, compared to other transport systems, the perfor- mance requirements for the chosen launch system are extremely high and the partially expendable solution is the only feasible one based on today’s technology and experience.. ",True,3
What are the fundamental concepts that outline the criteria for designing space transportation systems?,"These extreme requirements will become clear after the basic principles are presented in Section 3.1.2,3 Space Transportation Systems",True,3
What factors contribute to the lengthy and costly process of developing launch systems?,"following the introduction. The “building blocks” of a rocket are presented thereafter to give an impression of the complexity of the overall system and details of the resulting requirements. Because of the extreme requirements and the complexity of the system, the development of launch systems is an extensive process, in terms of both time and expense. A description of the logistics involved will complete the description, supported by an overview of today’s launch systems. At the end future prospects for reusable systems will be given.. ",True,4
What is the required speed for launching payloads into a low Earth orbit?,"Launch systems transport all types of spacecraft, which are simply named payload among the rocket community, to destinations in space targets. These destinations can be trajectories or selected places on the surface of planets or other cosmic bodies. In accord with cosmic velocities, launch systems must obtain high speeds and the accelerated payloads are therefore comparatively small. For launch into a low Earth orbit the payload must be accelerated to almost 8km/s and in this case it amounts to typically 1-5% of the take-off mass of the launch system.. ",True,3
What types of payloads can a rocket carry for different missions?,"Payloads of a rocket can be of very different types, depending on the particular mission, which may involve:e Scientific probes and satellites e Application satellites for— Telecommunications— Earth observation and meteorology— Navigation e Systems for human space missions.",True,2
What was the primary focus of early satellite missions in the first decade after the first launch?,"Since the first satellite launch — Sputnik 1 launched by the USSR on October 4, 1957 — the number of missions per year accomplished worldwide by space launchers has changed noticeably. In the beginning, military Earth observation as well as national prestige projects were of great importance and within 10 years the number of launches steadily increased to about 140 per year (including launch failures). ",True,2
What technological advancement led to a reversal of the trend in image recording and transmission?,"Afterwards this trend reversed, mainly because of the introduc- tion of digital image recording and transmission. This continuous reduction led to today’s number of. ",True,3
What is the expected trend in the number of space launches based on recent activities and developments?,"2/24/09 3:16:46 PM 3.1 Systemsabout 60 launches per year. If one examines the dif- ferent space mission activities and current launcher developments, the trend is predicted to change again to an increasing number of launches.",True,2
What percentage of annual launch capacity is utilized for telecommunication satellites?,"Today the launch of telecommunication satel- lites into geostationary orbit and/or into transfer orbits plays the most important role, using 30-40% of the available annual launch capacity. Most of these satellites are commercially operated and the costs con- nected with the launch and the associated risk are an important element in the economic business plan.",True,1
Which countries conduct human space missions despite the limited frequency of such missions?,"Human missions are conducted by the USA (Space Shuttle), Russia and China. With under 10 missions per year they are less significant regarding sheer number, but are of great importance for national budgets and industrial development because of the high expenditures for preparation and execution.",True,2
What challenges arise in differentiating between military and civilian satellite missions?,"It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between military and civilian missions. On one side the military exploit commercial satellites, at least for telecommunications, while on the other side purely military tasks are combined with tasks such as civil se- curity and disaster management. So far active weapon systems have not been placed in Earth orbits, or at least only to a very low extent. Because it is comparatively simple to detect and destroy satellites, it is expected that this will not fundamentally change.. ",True,3
What are the two types of flight phases used in launch systems to reach higher orbits?,"Determined by the payloads, launch systems accomplish different missions. Launch into a low Earth orbit (LEO) is the first step. With a combi- nation of propelled and ballistic (coasting) flight phases the higher orbits necessary for reaching the Moon or interplanetary targets can subsequently be achieved. Interstellar missions (with reasonable mis- sion durations) are beyond the capabilities of today’s aunch systems. ",True,2
What is the primary propulsion method used by space probes launched in the 1970s?,"For this, new propulsion technologies would be necessary. Space probes launched in the 970s (Pioneer and Voyager) — using rocket-powered aunch systems and gravitational maneuvers at planets — progressed furthest into outer space. Voyager has reached a distance of 100 astronomical units (i.e., 100 times the distance between the Sun and the Earth) or about 14 light-hours after approximately 30 years of flight time. Proxima Centauri, the closest neighbor of our Sun at about 4 light-years, is thus still very far away.. ",True,3
What speed does Earth maintain during its orbit around the Sun?,"Closer to home, flight toward our own Sun has its limits too. Realistically, even with a combination of a manageable number of stages and a reasonable payload it is not possible to reach the Sun directly. The Earth’s speed on its track around the Sun of 29.8 km/s is extremely high and at present an insurmountable obstacle.",True,2
What factors contribute to the complexity of developing launch systems?,"Launch systems are complex machines, consisting typically of several stages which often use varying propulsion systems. The development and required tests are accordingly complex. Extensive development budgets and long development times are necessary. In Europe a multitude of countries and compa- nies work on the development and production of the Ariane and Vega rockets. Political will is almost always the starting point for the decision to develop a launch system. ",True,3
What type of funding primarily supports the development and testing of launch systems globally?,"Development and testing of launch systems are accomplished worldwide with govern- ment funding. The US company SpaceX is one of the few exceptions. SpaceX is about to make the Falcon booster rocket operational with essentially only pri- vate investment. However, support in the form of government-funded technologies and infrastructure was also necessary.. ",True,1
What principle ensures financial contributions to national industries by ESA member states are returned to them?,"The political will for government funding is also motivated by the policy to support the national space industry with technologically interesting and challen- ging tasks. Therefore, as part of European cooperation the so-called georeturn rule applies, ensuring the re- turn of an ESA member state’s financial contributions back to that member state’s national industry.",True,2
What is considered the most critical subsystem in booster rockets?,The industrial constellations have likewise chan- ged since the first space launches and the trend to introduce more commercialization and rationali- zation is unmistakable. A limited number of system companies cooperate with multiple suppliers. The most important component or the most important subsystem of booster rockets and/or their stages is the propulsion system. The manufacturers of civil solid propellant engines are typically also manu- facturers of military rocket propulsion systems. ,True,4
What is the approximate total employment in developing and operating launch systems in Europe?,"The manufacturers of liquid propellant rocket systems are mostly united with aviation engine manufactu- rers. About 7000 people altogether are employed in developing and operating launch systems in Europe. A small number of them, about 200 engineers, work at Arianespace, the European commercial operator. ",True,2
What is the name of the new smaller launch vehicle that will be operated by the company of the Ariane rocket?,"2/24/09 3:16:46 PM CHO3.indd 118company of the Ariane rocket. In the future this company will also operate the new smaller launch vehicle, Vega. In addition, Arianespace, in coope- ration with a Russian manufacturing firm, will launch Soyuz rockets from the European launch site of Kourou in South America, presumably starting from 2009.",True,2
What type of satellites did the first launch operator focus on launching?,"Arianespace was the first launch operator (also called launch service provider) to concentrate on the launch of commercial satellites. Success helped Europe to keep the institutional spending necessary for the infrastructure — often also called fixed costs — attractively low. The infrastructure for launcher pro- duction and operation comprises the launch pad, trajectory tracking, weather forecasting and data communication. In addition, special industrial in- frastructure for manufacturing, integration and tes- ting must be included.. ",True,1
What factors led to a reduction in world market prices for commercial launch systems?,"As a result of the historical evolutionary process, fixed and development costs are financed by govern- ment budgets. Driven by competing launcher systems and low prices (in particular Russian manufacturers offer extremely low prices) the world market prices for commercial space launcher systems dropped so far that Arianespace could no longer recover a substantial portion of the fixed costs. But after US manufacturers withdrew from the commercial market and the Russian launchers increasingly faced problems of quality and costing, price development has tended again toward cost coverage, including the fixed costs.. ",True,3
What principle is combined with the fundamental rocket equation to assess launch vehicle performance?,"To understand launch systems, as a first step one has to understand the basic aspects of the task and design of a launcher. In principle the task is to launch a payload into its designated orbit, and computation of the performance of the launcher is the basis of the design. Ascent against Earth’s gravitational force to reach an Earth orbit is the primary task of a space launch system. For today’s usually rocket-powered launch vehicles, the fundamental rocket equation in combination with the principle of staging provides a necessary, but not sufficient, basis for assessing performance.. ",True,3
How can one estimate the launch system's ability to achieve the needed velocity change for a specific payload and orbit?,3 Space Transportation Systems3.1.2.1 Payloads and MissionsKnowing the payload mass and the target orbit a simple mission analysis can be accomplished. The core of this simple mission analysis is to determine the launch system’s capability of producing the required velocity change Av necessary to execute the mission.,True,3
What factors influence the velocity increment aside from the target orbit velocity?,This velocity increment is determined to a large extent by the velocity of the target orbit. Other con- siderations are:,True,2
What factors must be considered in achieving the necessary velocity for a launch system?,e The initial speed due to the Earth’s rotation e The gravitational lossese The losses from air dragAdditional details will be given in the following sections.The velocity gain provided by the launch system must at least correspond to the velocity requirement of the mission.

What aspects are evaluated regarding structural weight and fuel remnants for every phase?,e Structural mass and fuel residuals (for each stage).The derivation of the theoretical basis and the asso- ciated formulas are likewise given in the following sections.,True,2
What can be defined to account for estimation uncertainties in mission analysis?,"A further important component of the mission analysis is the introduction of margins. A simple, but success-promising logic is: the simpler the estimation, the more margins must be introduced. Justified by the uncertainties of the estimations, margins can be defined for:",True,3
What factors need to be considered for propulsion performance in each mission stage?,e Velocity requirement of the missione Propulsion performance (for each stage) e Structural mass (for each stage).,True,3
What methods can enhance performance calculations in launch systems?,"The margins can be reduced by improving the cal- culation of performance with the help of a detailed simulation of the launch system. Typically these numeric simulations are mixtures of theoretically derived equations (from mechanics, thermodynamics, aerodynamics, reaction chemistry, etc.) and empirical",True,3
What is the primary equation that relates to momentum in rocketry?,2/24/09 3:16:46 PM 3.1 Systemsrelations combined with actual experience. Examples of such experience are included in the following sections.3.1.2.2 Momentum and the Fundamental Rocket Equation,True,3
"How does the expulsion of mass from a rocket affect its speed, based on momentum principles?","Rockets use propellant, which they carry along, to produce thrust and velocity. With this principle they are to a large extent independent of their environment and therefore suitable for traveling into outer space. On the basis of the principle of the conservation of linear momentum, the discharging of an incremental particle with mass dm and speed c causes an opposite momentum on the rocket, that is a speed change dv of the rocket mass m:. ",True,5
What does the variable Mp represent in the fundamental rocket equation?,"If the exhaust velocity c is constant and if no further forces affect the rocket mass, then the variables can be separated and integrated for the fundamental rocket equation, which was conceived in 1903 by the Russian scientist K. Tsiolkovsky (or Ziolkowski):v= ideal velocity gain, Mp = initial mass of the rocket, m, = mass at burnout.",True,2
How is the requirement for a steady exhaust speed achieved in modern launch systems?,"The demand for a constant exhaust velocity is ful- filled to a good approximation by chemical rocket propulsion, which is used in today’s launch systems.",True,3
How can the acceleration of a rocket be calculated using thrust and mass?,"From the principle of the conservation of linear momentum the thrust F of the rocket also can be derived as the product of the mass flow mand the exhaust velocity c:From the thrust and the rocket mass the acceleration acan be computed: a=F/m [mls*] (3.1.4)All considerations of forces and acceleration must take into account that thrust, air drag, lift and similar",True,3
Differentiate between contact forces and internal forces related to a rocket's movement.,"kinds of forces are contact forces. The force of gravity is by contrast an interior force, and its effect on the reaction forces within a rocket and on its movement must therefore be regarded differently.",True,3
How does staging influence the velocity gain of a rocket during its ascent?,A single rocket stage can hardly reach orbital speed unless the payload is very small. This limitation can be overcome by staging. The ideal velocity gain of the individual stages then adds up to the total velocity gain VG: VG=Vy + V2 +13... (3.1.5) Computation of the total velocity gain based on the fundamental rocket equation requires consideration of the masses of the upper stages in the initial and burnout masses of the lower stages. ,True,3
What is the formula to approximate the number of stages in a staged rocket launcher based on exhaust velocities?,"The velocity gain of the individual stages is thereby reduced. However, in total a larger velocity gain and/or larger payload performance is achieved. But this increase is limited. The maximum performance of a staged rocket laun- cher results to a first approximation in the following number of stages: Nop, = 1.12 + v/e (3.1.6) where Cis the average value of the exhaust velocities of all stages. As the equation delivers typically a deci- mal number it must be rounded to the next integer.. ",True,3
"What are the exhaust velocity approximations for solid, medium-energy liquid, and high-energy liquid propulsion systems?","With the above equations the efficiency of launch vehicles can be computed as a first approximation. However, reference values for the employed parameters are necessary.To estimate the exhaust velocity three characteristic propellant groups can be distinguished: e Solid propellant engines, c ~ 2500 m/s e Medium-energy liquid propulsion, c ~ 3000 m/s e High-energy liquid propulsion, c ~ 4000 m/s.",True,2
What is the formula used to calculate the specific impulse in propulsion systems?,From this the specific impulse results from the equation Isp = ego [s] (3.1.7),True,3
What is the typical range of structural mass as a percentage of the total mass in rocket stages?,as a common performance figure for propulsion.2/24/09 3:16:47 PM CHO3.indd 120For the computation of the mass ratios it is neces- sary to estimate the structural mass. It varies typically between 5 and 15% of the total mass depending on the size of the rocket stage and the propulsion and/or propellants used.,True,3
What type of propulsion is recommended for the lower stages of a launch vehicle?,It is meaningful to use solid propellant engines for the first flight phase and high-energy liquid propul- sion for the upper stages. The solid propellant stages are well suited to produce the take-off thrust. The high-energy and accordingly more efficient upper stages are less heavy and thus reduce the propulsion task of the lower stages. Therefore the investment in high-energy propellant upper stages also results in a reduction of the mass of the lower stages.. ,True,3
What are the key factors influencing the ascent trajectory of a vehicle during launch?,3.1.2.4 Ascent Trajectory and Performance Requirements,True,3
What is the minimum thrust requirement for a launch vehicle to achieve a successful take-off?,"The ascent of a launch vehicle begins vertically. This is due to the technical feasibility and the dynamic behavior during the launch phase. For a successful take-off it is necessary for the thrust to be at least equal to the launch vehicle mass. A 10-20% higher take-off thrust helps the launcher, which is flight dynamically unstable, to maintain both the correct flight attitude by swiveling the rocket engines and the acceleration to build up the required speed. ",True,2
What happens to acceleration at burnout when take-off thrust is increased?,"However, further increasing the take-off thrust is of no advantage. On the one hand additional investments in propulsion would become necessary, and on the other hand the acceleration at burnout would become even higher, putting additional strain on the system, because when the major part of the propellant is used up, the lighter weight of the rocket experiences high acceleration.. ",True,2
What angle must a rocket tilt shortly after take-off to achieve a horizontal orbit?,To reach a horizontal orbit it is necessary to tilt the rocket shortly after take-off by roughly 10°. After the tilt maneuver the thrust direction can be optimally oriented so that it is tangential to the flight direction. Gravitational force then turns the trajectory toward a horizontal orientation. The initial tilt must be mat- ched with the acceleration level and the target orbit in such a way that at burnout the desired orbital speed and flight attitude are reached.. ,True,2
What factors influence the initial speed during a space launch?,The velocity requirement for space launch sys- tems results mainly from the difference between the initial and terminal speeds. For the initial speed the Earth’s rotation must be taken into account; it of3 Space Transportation Systemscourse depends on the geographical latitude of the launch site and the direction of the trajectory. The terminal velocity is the target orbital speed.,True,3
What are gravitational losses associated with in a launch vehicle ascent?,"The ascent from the surface to an orbit is an ascent inside Earth’s gravitational field. Thus so-called gravitational losses will occur. This corresponds not only to the gravitational energy invested in the payload, butalso tothe gravitational energy invested in the sections of the launch vehicle to be transported upward, and in particular in the build-up of the “fuel and/or ex- haust tower.” Coasting flight phases in the out-of- atmosphere part of the ascent of launch vehicles can help to reduce gravitational losses. ",True,3
What factors contribute to increased velocity requirements in orbital maneuvers?,"Air drag and steer- ing losses lead to additional velocity requirements. At the end, margins for unexpected orbit/trajectory disturbances and inaccuracies must be included.. ",True,3
What is the typical range of total velocity required to achieve low Earth orbit?,The velocity requirement for reaching a low Earth orbit (~200km altitude) adds up as follows:e Orbital velocity: 7.9 km/se Earth rotation speed gains at launch: 0-465 m/s e Gravitational losses: 1-1.5 km/se Air drag losses: 100-150 m/se Steering losses: 20-50 m/se Performance margin: 1-2%e Total: 8.6-9.8 km/s.,True,3
What types of missions require higher velocity for launch from a specific site in South America?,"Missions to a Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), geosta- tionary orbit (GEO) and/or its transfer orbit (GTO), lunar missions or escape missions from Earth’s gravi- tational field result in accordingly higher velocity requi- rements. Values for the launch from the European launch site at Kourou in South America are given in Table 3.1.1.",True,2

What types of propulsion systems are typically used to enhance acceleration during the initial flight phase of a rocket?,Boost stages with their high-thrust engines pro- vide additional accelerating power during the first flight phase for reducing large gravitational losses. Mainly solid propulsion and medium-energy liquid propellant rocket engines are used.,True,3
What are the key components of each propulsive stage in a launch vehicle?,"In general two, three or four stages form the propulsive system of a launch vehicle. Each of these propulsive stages consists of propellant tanks, propel- lant pumps, rocket engines, attitude control system and an interstage including the stage separation sys- tem. Propellants and propulsive system concepts may differ for each stage. A performance-optimized launch vehicle is made of high-thrust lower stages and an upper stage with a high specific impulse engine.. ",True,3

"What is required, besides a high reuse rate, for achieving significant cost reduction in launch vehicle systems?","Higher reliability does not directly result from reuse, since the necessary return capability makes the launch vehicle more complex. However, a noticeable cost reduction can only be achieved with high reuse rates, which depend on very high system reliability. Apart from a high reuse rate, high reuse of the launch vehicle itself and/or its stages is necessary in order to achieve a noticeable cost reduction.. ",True,3
What is the maximum inclination for launches where reuse is feasible according to current efforts?,"Because of the additional effort required to get the vehicle and/or stages back to Earth, reuse will be limited to launches into LEO (300-600 km level and 0-100° inclination), at least for the near future. Ongoing missions (GTO/GEO, Moon, interplanetary) will therefore continue to require expendable upper stages.",True,2
What are the key challenges that need to be addressed to achieve a fully reusable single-stage space transportation system?,"In analogy to aircraft a fully reusable single-stage space transportation system which delivers its payload together with an expendable upper stage into LEO is regarded as a goal.

What is required alongside theoretical analysis to ensure efficient operation of a reusable launch system?,"Besides these trends the substantial result of today’s experience is the insight that to master the routine, reliable and cost-efficient operation of a reusable launch system, extensive operational experience is necessary, apart from theoretical understanding. Accordingly, further theoretical analysis and operati- onal experience must progress in parallel. It is to be expected that several “generations” of launch systems will be necessary before operational skills of a “routine practice” level are achieved.. ",True,3

How does minimizing take-off mass impact overall costs in the context of a launch system?,"But already the definition of the optimization goal requires a commitment which cannot take into account all criteria of subsequent developmental decisions. There is the possibility to optimize perfor- mance by minimizing the take-off mass of the launch system for a given payload and target orbit. However, minimum take-off mass does not necessarily mean minimum costs, and minimum costs might be the costs for a single mission or those of the complete life cycle of the system, including development.

What is a potential drawback of using existing components in system development?,"In reality, however, not everything is developed from scratch. The use of available components saves de- velopment costs, although it can impose conditions on components or on the entire system leading to suboptimal solutions.. ",True,3
What is crucial for a rational selection process in decision-making?,"In a development, decision criteria which cannot be incorporated into a technical or cost simulation might also play a role. For a rational selection pro- cess, the definition of appropriate criteria and their weighting is essential.

What is the benefit of discarding stages after burnout in a launcher system?,"As previously mentioned, launcher systems typically consist of several stages. This approach makes it possible to optimize, in the sense of the Tsiolkovsky equation, the used chemical propulsion systems. After the burnout of each stage it is discarded and the engine of the next stage is ignited. This not only reduces the dry mass of the rocket, but also means that the design of each stage can be optimized for the requirements of the specific mission. ",True,3
What factors are defined through optimized staging regarding fuel and thrust in launch systems?,"An optimized staging determines the amount of fuel and the engine thrust for each individual stage, which has far-reaching consequences for the definition of the stage architecture, the pro- pellant combination and the propulsion system. The distinguishing criteria and characteristics of staged launch systems are introduced below.. ",True,3
What types of fuels are typically used in kick stages and upper stages for optimized performance?,"Whereas the lower stages are optimized for thrust or power, the kick stages and upper stages are optimized for energy yield. For this reason, primarily cryogenic fuels are used in the latter (high exit velocity of the exhaust gas), whereas for lower stages solid fuels are more common (high impulse, high ejection mass flow, but low specific impulse). Kick stages only make sense if they either provide a significantly higher specific impulse than the apogee motor of the satellite, or can place it in orbit with more precision. ",True,3
What is the primary advantage of transfer stages compared to upper stages during planetary missions?,"Transfer stages for lunar or planetary missions are, in contrast to upper stages, far better adapted to the thermal condi- tions in orbit. In order to protect the super-insulation during ascent, transfer stages are usually located under the payload fairing.. ",True,3
Why are the lower stages of a rocket typically longer and wider than the upper stages?,Lower stages are longer and often have a larger diameter than rocket upper stages. The higher vol- ume is needed to assure the high thrust required for ascent and the associated high propellants mass flow (see also Section 3.1).,True,2
What types of propellants are used in booster rockets?,"Booster rockets can use either liquid or solid propellants. They are often operated in parallel with the lower stage. In the case of Ariane 4, high flexi- bility of the payload capacity could be achieved by using various combinations of liquid and solid fuel boosters. Both the US Atlas V and Delta IV launchers use so-called common core boosters (CCBs) in their heavy-load versions. Smaller solid fuel boosters (for. ",True,2

What are the benefits of replacing solid boosters with liquid boosters in Delta IV-M rockets?,"Delta IV-M GEM-60 boosters) are replaced by liquid boosters of the same design as used for the main stage. This reduces production costs (learning curve, number of identical parts) as well as the acceleration oad on the payload. However, such launchers reach their necessary final velocity only very slowly (long burn times for the lower stage and the booster) and the control of thrust is much more complex than when solid fuel boosters are used. For Delta IV-M rockets, so-called “cross-feeding” is utilized, whereby. ",True,3
What is the process involving fuel transfer from boosters to the primary stage during ascent?,uel is continuously pumped from the boosters to the primary stage during ascent.,True,3
What are the additional components required for liquid propellant stages compared to solid fuels?,"Stages powered by liquid propellants have a more complex design than in the case of solid fuels, since additional components and control equipment (such as valves, pumps and energy supply, measurement system) are necessary for the feed system, the fuel pressurization system and for the fueling operation. Solid fuels are used much more frequently in boosters and lower stages than in upper stages due to the limi- ted flexibility and accuracy for orbit injection. ",True,3
What percentage of launch thrust do the solid fuel boosters in Ariane 5 provide?,"After solid fuel stages have been ignited, there is normally no way to influence the firing duration (which is typi- cally two minutes), since that was already determined by the geometry of the fuel when it was designed and fabricated. In the high-performance STS or Ariane 5 launchers currently in use, large solid fuel boosters are employed, which in the case of Ariane 5 provide up to 92% of the launch thrust (Figure 3.2.3).

Which propulsion concepts are efficient for upper stages and only relevant in orbit?,"Exotic propulsion concepts such as solar thermal or electric propulsion are only efficient in orbit and are accordingly only of interest for upper stages, kick stages or transfer stages.

What mechanism allows the Centaur upper stage to be used in different orbital injections?,"a source of failure. But the geographic position of the launch site is not always ideal for the desired satellite orbit, which requires that the upper stage be reignited because of the limited power of the launch system. Examples are the need to inject directly into anear-GEO orbit, or the descent of a stage to force its reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.

What is the benefit of positioning the oxygen tank below the hydrogen tank in cryogenic upper stages?,"stage (3). Another question concerns which propellant to position closest to the engine. In order to locate the center of gravity toward the top, in the case of cryogenic propellants it is theoretically desirable to position the hydrogen tank closer to the engine in order to exploit the taller tank height of the hydrogen and the greater weight of the oxygen for effective thrust vector control. Nevertheless, for cryogenic upper stages the opposite is usually done (e.g., for the Centaur and ESC-A upper stages), since a heavy oxygen tank mounted below the hydrogen tank yields a smaller dimensioning loadcase and thus a lower mass for this stage.. ",True,4
What are the dual roles of the engine housing in solid fuel stages and boosters?,"For solid fuel stages and boosters the engine housing fulfills the two functions of fuel storage and combustion chamber.

They generate constant thrust levels by constant mass flows. The hot combustion gases are in contact with the motor case from the beginning of the burn. Con- sequently, long burn durations would require excessive internal thermal protection layers and increase weight to unacceptable levels.

What is the consequence of ignition delay in propellant engines concerning pressure peaks?,"provided has to be sufficiently high to ensure pro- pellant vaporization and heating propellants to temperatures which exceed the ignition temperature. Propellant temperatures under 100K make it obvi- ous why heat transfer is a key element of the engine start-up. An ignition delay of only a few milliseconds may be sufficient to accumulate enough propellants which, when they react, yield pressure peaks which can be harmful to the combustion chamber or for other components of the engine.

What can trigger damage to the engine and result in mission failure?,"Additionally, such pressure peaks can trigger combustion instabilities which almost always lead to damage of the engine and a loss of the entire mission.

What challenge arises from the exit pressure of booster engine nozzles during ground start due to overexpansion?,"Thrust-optimized contours are more sensitive to side loads during operational transients because of their internal specific fluid conditions and therefore necessitate more robust structures compared to ideal nozzles. One of the basic problems of booster engine nozzles results from their long burning time. The exit pressure of the nozzle on the ground (during start) is smaller than the ambient pressure (overexpansion), and therefore the thrust is lower than optimal. ",True,3
What happens when the expansion ratio surpasses a specific threshold in a nozzle extension?,"If the expansion ratio exceeds a certain limit, flow separation occurs in the nozzle extension, creating destructive side loads. During the ascent the ambient pressure decreases steadily until the optimum thrust is reached when ambient and exit pressures are identical. During further ascent the ambient pressure continuously decreases below the exit pressure (underexpansion) and deviation from the optimum thrust increases.

What are the two main classifications of axial turbines based on their operational principles?,main axial turbine types are impulse turbines and reaction turbines.,True,2
What does the reaction degree signify in the context of turbine pressure drops?,"In the impulse turbine the working gas is expanded in the stator and accelerated to high velocity. The acting momentum causes rotation of the rotor. The cross- section between the blades is constant and the gas flow is merely redirected. In the idealized friction-free case the gas is not accelerated, the pressure remains constant and the reaction degree is zero. The reaction degree characterizes the pressure drop in the rotor as a fraction of the pressure drop in the whole stage (sta- tor plus rotor). ",True,3
What are the two design types of impulse turbines used in certain gas generator engines?,The impulse turbine is used mainly in gas generator cycle engines with high pressure ratios and low flow rates; it exists in two design variants: velocity-compounded or pressure-compounded. In the first variant the gas is expanded only in the first stator; the flow is redirected only in the following ro- tor and subsequent stages. In the second variant the gas is expanded in the stator and is redirected in the rotor of every stage.. ,True,3
What is the role of rotor expansion in achieving 100% reaction degree in turbine types?,"In this turbine type the expansion is distributed bet- ween the stator and rotor.

What are the key factors influencing the operational lifespan of thrust chambers?,3.3.4 Special ProblemsLife of Thrust Chambers,True,3
What temperatures are experienced in rocket engine thrust chambers during operation?,"The thrust chambers of rocket engines undergo high thermal and mechanical stress during operation, im- posed by internal and external loads. Internal loads are the chamber pressure, the resulting thrust and the thermal loads along the hot gas wall and in the cooling channels. For example, temperatures from 20 to about 3800 K are reached during operation of the engine. Mechanical loads (aside from thrust loads) are induced by the inertial forces during gimbaling of the engine for thrust vector control and by transient side loads during engine ramp-up.. ",True,4
What are the two primary types of failure caused by extreme thermal and mechanical loads?,"External loads are mainly pressure pulsations in the engine’s ambient atmosphere, called buffeting, as well as the heating of the engine’s outer surface by radiation from the solid booster flames.These extreme thermal and mechanical loads can lead to two basically different kinds of failure: failure by fatigue and failure by rupture.",True,2

The risk of malfunction during operation is reduced by this effect, but is very high in the case of engine reignition.",True,3
What can be the maximum percentage of nominal thrust that side loads can reach during engine ramp-up?,A classic example for sudden overstraining is the occurrence of side loads during engine ramp- up. These side loads result from asymmetrical flow separation in the nozzle extension before the nozzle is fully flowing. These loads can reach up to 10% of the nominal thrust of the engine.,True,2
What design considerations are critical to mitigate oscillations in propulsion systems with high energy density?,"Oscillations in Propulsion SystemsAs a consequence of its high energy density combined with small internal losses, the propulsion system of a launcher stage is a nearly undamped system. Therefore, special care has to be taken during the development process to design propulsion systems which avoid oscillations.",True,3
What can result from interactions between propellant tanks and the rocket engine during oscillations?,"Oscillations occur either if there are interactions between the propellant tanks and the rocket engine, or if pressure oscillations are induced in the engine itself.

What type of propulsion system is less susceptible to pressure fluctuations?,possible injection pressure loss. Pressure-fed propul- sion systems are much more vulnerable to chugging than are pump-fed systems because the turbopump already guarantees a high degree of decoupling.,True,3
What type of fluctuations can cause instability in the combustion process of a propellant engine?,"Oscillations in the Combustion Chambers Besides low-frequency oscillations, high-frequency oscillations are also triggered within the liquid pro- pellant engine’s combustion process. The triggering is induced by the coupling of the chemical reaction process with the eigenfrequency of the combustion volume. Resonances can occur within these oscilla- tions in preferred frequency bands, which may lead to an unstable combustion process, called combustion instability. ",True,3
What can extreme oscillations in combustion lead to within a combustion chamber?,"It results in oscillations with a very high energy content which may lead to the demolition of the combustion chamber. This dynamic combustion behavior has been the subject of intensive research for many years in an attempt to find an accurate mathe- matical formulation supported by comprehensive experimental investigations. Such phenomena occur not only during the steady- state operational phase, but also during the transients while the engine is being ramped up or down. ",True,3

What is the primary disadvantage of using decentralized testing methodologies for propulsion systems?,"During the development phase of an engine, all components of a propulsion system are usually tested in parallel and only later, using specific test facilities, are they qualified together as subsystems or as an en- tire engine. Such a development and testing methodo- logy requires various large-scale facilities, which are a major cost factor.

What changes occur to the thrust and pressure difference across the nozzle during ascent?,"There is a general rule: fly as you test and test as you fly, and no component, subsystem or engine ever flies before it has been demonstrated that it fulfills all the requirements and operates within the safety mar- gins. However, it is not always possible to realize this principle totally. For example, the ambient pressure during ascent decreases continuously, thus changing the thrust as well as the pressure difference across the thrust nozzle. ",True,3
What are the challenges in modifying test benches for simulating rocket engine ascent?,"It is extremely costly to modify a test bench for large rocket engines to simulate this ascent, and therefore such tests are often omitted.

What component significantly lowers the temperature of the gases before they enter the ejector stage?,"is fired directly at the water-cooled plug diffuser which is connected to the first ejector stage, which drastically reduces the temperature of the exhaust gases. The con- denser, which is open to an underground reservoir, and the second ejector stage are the key components which guarantee the continuous cooling and repressurization of the exhaust gases.

What elements constitute the overall process of a launch system qualification?,"The whole qualification process of a launch system not only comprises the launcher itself; it also comprises the ground segment, that is all the required facilities and operations for launch preparation and the launch campaign (see Section 3.4). For proving operational and mission readiness of the ground segment, in prin- ciple the same approach as for space flight equipment applies. However, other requirements and test meth- ods are used to demonstrate the functioning of all installations and their coherency within the complete system; the communications network, all nominal and backup operational procedures, and last but not least the decision procedure’s operational suitability.

What is the purpose of the verification matrix in the qualification process for launch vehicles?,"The qualification measures related to the ground segment are called verification of operational readiness. Concerning the launch vehicle itself, the starting point for any qualification process is the verifica- tion matrix, which is subdivided into a number of requirement categories for better overview.

What is the purpose of conducting mechanical tests on launch vehicles?,"As an example, mechanical qualification is considered here in terms of mechanical tests to prove the struc- tural readiness of the launcher. This also seems to be of particular interest, since due to the large size of a launch vehicle special requirements have to be defined to plan and to perform the qualification steps. Accord- ingly, qualification is often performed on complete launch vehicle stages.. ",True,2

In this context, however, the application of these test approaches to launch vehicles is discussed, addressing both mechanical strength and operational readiness.",True,4
What is the qualification focus for launch vehicle components in terms of subsystems?,"Due to the size of launch vehicles, the respective qualification measures are practically restricted to the main constituents of a launcher, usually the launcher stages or major subsystems. Accordingly, within the scope of the complete system qualification approach, it has to be ensured that all subassemblies are sepa- rately qualified, in particular when their individual qualification is not possible on a higher integration level.

What is typically evaluated primarily on a propellant line before its integration into a larger model?,"For example: the qualification of a propellant line is mainly performed on the line itself, even if this line is later integrated into the stage qualifica- tion model.. ",True,3
Why is it essential to define interfaces and operational conditions for launch vehicle stages before testing?,"To enable the testing of the launch vehicle main constituents or stages, it is mandatory that their in- terfaces and operational conditions are well defined and considered prior to testing. For example, since the propellant constitutes most of the launch vehicle’s mass, the different tank fill rates and how they change during the mission have to be considered during test- ing with respect to the static and dynamic behavior. ",True,3
How do configuration tests on fill rates impact the overall system performance?,"This may mean that several configurations, namely tank fill rates, have to be tested. Another example is that stage separation changes the boundary condi- tions from being restrained and clamped to free mov- ing, and together with the changes in the propulsion during the staging sequence, the loads and fluxes alter significantly..

What factors necessitate comprehensive planning of mechanical tests in structural development?,"The size of the structures, the complex nature of the boundary conditions and the permanent changes in mass and enviromental conditions during flight require that mechanical tests be comprehensively planned, that representative structural models be provided at an early development step, and that con- siderable effort be undertaken to prepare or modify test facilities, in particular cases even to build new test facilities and to prepare dedicated jigs and load- ing devices.

What is the name of the test that verifies the entire propulsion system and stage together?,"The qualification of the propulsion systems considers both the transient and stationary opera- tional phases of the engines. In doing so, each single component, like pumps, igniter and thrust chamber, as well as the complete engine are verified. The test involving the whole engine is called the firing test. When involving the entire propulsion system and the stage, the test is called stage hot firing test. ",True,3
What factors contribute to significant structural vibrations in an engine during hot firing tests?,"The preparation of hot firing tests requires the intense co- operation of all engineering disciplines involved, since, for instance, the gas flow in the engine may excite significant structural vibrations at the engine nozzle or the feed lines. The running engine causes high thermal stress (thermal radiation, hot exhaust gas flow) for the engine, the test stand and the environment as well. It is quite complex to operate on the upper stage under real vacuum conditions on the grotind. ",True,4
What aspects of engine components are examined through development evaluations?,"Therefore, in so-called development tests, the behavior of engine components and partial engine working cycles are verified, applying water or gas flow tests. During en- gine qualification all relevant operational modes and functions (operational box) are tested, in particular the transient phases like ignition and run-up, as well as the shutdown phase. Instable conditions during ignition or later during nominal combustion may quickly lead to engine loss, since the combustion of the propellant is a highly energetic process. ",True,3
What potential issues can arise from gas expulsion in engine nozzles?,"Irregular expulsion of gas may lead to hot spots which may melt the material of the nozzle throat. Hot firing tests on main stage engines or booster engines have to consider that high vibration and acoustic loads may occur and easily lead to fatigue failures on the nozzle or other engine parts. If the engine uses regenerative cooling, the correct function of this system must of course be shown before any hot firing takes place.

What should be conducted to verify quality after a change in the supplier during the production process?,"Then the production process is stabilized and, whenever required, optimized.

What challenges do spacecraft materials face due to extreme temperature variations and gradients in space?,"As soon as a spacecraft has started its journey it is exposed on the one hand to the cold temperatures of space and on the other hand to the direct unfiltered radiation of the Sun. This results in high temperature fluctuations with the consequence of steep tempera- ture gradients, which have to be taken into conside- ration. Most of the materials and components used in the construction are only suited to more moderate and Earth-like temperature ranges and often withstand only very limited gradients.. ",True,4
What methods are used to control temperatures within a spacecraft to ensure subsystems operate effectively?,"In addition, all active subsystems in the spacecraft generate heat, which has to be included in the con- siderations as well.

To achieve this, the temperatures have to be monitored and controlled by passive or active methods inside the spacecraft. This is explained and shown by realistic examples.. ",True,4
What type of systems do modern spacecraft typically incorporate for orbit maintenance or adjustment?,"The first spacecraft were carried directly into their target orbit by a rocket.

What has replaced the rotational stabilization in modern satellites for maintaining orientation?,"Besides the precise positioning of a spacecraft in an orbit, often the attitude of the spacecraft is of importance for the success of a mission. Early spacecraft were stabilized by rotation around their own axis. Today, most satellites have to be operated in precisely defined and maintained orientations, or, as in the case of Earth observation satellites, they have to point precisely at a selected target on the ground.

What components are used to determine and adjust orientation in an attitude control system?,"To achieve this, an attitude control system has to determine and adjust the orientation.

Sensors like gyros, accelerometers, star sensors, GPS, etc., and actuators like torquers and electromagnetic coils are applied for the purpose.. ",True,3
What is the role of the control system in relation to spacecraft autonomy?,"Together with the payload, the various subsystems form a network which is controlled by one or more on-board processors.

The control system is re- sponsible for achieving maximum autonomy for the spacecraft. ",True,3
What characteristics are essential for a subsystem operating in extreme environmental conditions?,"This requires not only high computing power, but often also very high software complexity.

What factor is crucial for a spacecraft to complete its mission successfully?,"A spacecraft can only perform its mission if it is linked to a ground station for control and data reception.

What determines the overall configuration during the early stages of spacecraft development?,"In organizational charts and listings displaying the subsystems of a spacecraft the structure appears very often in first place, usually followed by power supply and thermal control. This first place has less to do with any “ranking” than with the sequence in which the subsystems become design drivers. Like the hull of a ship in the shipbuilding process between keel laying and launching, the structure of a spacecraft de- termines the overall configuration already at an early phase of the development process, and also needs to be qualified first.

What must be redesigned if the structural-thermal model does not meet the specified requirements?,"Consequently, the first qualification model of a satellite is usually the structural-thermal model (STM). If it does not satisfy the requirements, then possibly the whole configuration and all the mechanical interfaces will need to be redesigned from scratch.

What factors influence the design process for extraterrestrial landing vehicles?,"For extraterrestrial missions completely different load cases may govern the dimensioning process.

What materials are primarily used in laminates for space applications?,"The development and steady improvement of carbon fibers [4.1.6] over the last few decades has paved the way for the leading role of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates in modern aerospace en- gineering. Laminates composed of high-modulus or high-tenacity carbon fibers embedded in a ther- mosetting matrix (mostly epoxy resin) are today the backbone of the structural technology for space ap- plications [4.1.7], [4.1.8], [4.1.9], [4.1.10]. Laminates with thermoplastic matrices, on the other hand, are of minor importance in space due to their lower heat resistance.. ",True,2
What technique is used for structures with approximately rotational symmetry during manufacturing?,"Flat laminates are frequently manufactured from pre-impregnated fiber layers (prepregs), while for structures with large curvatures and more complex forms it is better to first position the still dry carbon fiber layers (fabric etc.) in a mold and then imp- regnate them with the still-liquid matrix resin. For the manufacturing of structures with approximately rotational symmetry, such as cylinders or tanks, the dry fiber roving is pulled through an immersion basin with liquid epoxy before it is wrapped around the rotating preform (filament winding technique).

What materials are commonly used for the outer face sheets in modern sandwich plates for spacecraft structures?,"Today, sandwich construction is the most widely used approach for manufacturing spacecraft structures. Sandwich plates consist of two parallel face sheets, preferably aluminum alloys or carbon fiber laminates, which are glued onto both sides of an intermediate sandwich core. In most cases the latter is a honey- comb core with hexagonal cells, but corrugated metal sheets, sheets with a zigzag profile, or hard foam cores are used as well.. ",True,4
What core material is favored in specific applications over aramid fiber paper?,"The preferred core material is aluminum, while aramid fiber paper (Nomex), which is quite common in aircraft construction, is not often used in space ap- plications because of the environmental conditions.",True,2
What factors influence the strength and stiffness of a sandwich plate with a honeycomb core?,"Figure 4.1.3 shows in principle the composition of a sandwich plate with a honeycomb core with he- xagonal cells. Its mechanical properties, in particular its strength and stiffness under tension, compression, shear and bending loads, depend decisively on the face sheet thickness, the core thickness, the cell size and the thickness of the honeycomb cell walls - apart from the pure material properties as such.

How do the mechanical characteristics vary between the length and width directions of the manufactured core?,"Here it must be noted that, due to the manufacturing of the honey- comb core from individual thin ribbons which are folded and then glued together at the points depicted in Figure 4.1.3, the mechanical properties in the length direction differ from those in the width direction.. ",True,4
What structure prevents air entrapment in honeycomb cores during spacecraft launch?,"Since adhesion between the honeycomb core and the sandwich face sheets is achieved by means of an adhesive film which creeps into the fillets between the inner side of the face sheet and the cell walls per- pendicular to it and hardens there, the cells would be hermetically closed if venting were neglected. By perforating the ribbon material in the course of ho- neycomb core manufacturing it is assured that after launch of the spacecraft the air enclosed in the cells can quickly evacuate through small holes or slits..

What challenges arise in calculating properties of sandwich structures with non-isotropic face sheets?,"The large number of sandwich parameters (parti- cularly if the face sheet is not isotropic but a multidi- rectional fiber laminate) makes it possible to “tailor” a variety of sandwich properties, but makes their analytical calculation rather complex.

What is the primary advantage of using sandwich plates in spacecraft structures?,Spacecraft structures can be composed of sand- wich plates in different basic geometrical forms. The simplest case is illustrated in Figure 4.1.4 [4.1.15] and is representative of many small satellites. Their basic form is a cube or cuboid where five of the six sides are lightweight sandwich plates and the sixth is a more massive bottom plate. This configuration can be easily folded together and is therefore easy to integrate as well.

What type of cross-section is commonly used for the central structure in large satellites?,"Large satellites, however, need a central structure. An often favored solution is a combination of a cen- tral tube with a circular cross-section, which can be advantageously manufactured using a filament wind- ing technique and a cuboid outer sandwich structure. With an appropriate liner inside, the central tube can be ideally used as a fuel tank. The surrounding sand- wich plates form several individual compartments for accommodation of the payloads.

What structural components are essential for the attachment of the Rosetta lander in the orbiter model?,"Figure 4.1.5 shows a half-finished structural model of the orbiter for ESA’s comet mission Rosetta.

These are located at the intersection of two (finally three) sandwich plates oriented perpendicular to each other.. ",True,2
What structural design primarily focuses on thermal considerations in the Rosetta lander?,"Different from this classical configuration is the primary structure of the Rosetta lander, as shown in Figure 4.1.6.

What types of stiffness must the truss provide in a satellite with sandwich plates?,"In some satellites the sandwich plates are arranged one level over the other, connected by a truss of stiff rods. In this case the truss has to ensure not only high stiffness along the longitudinal axis of the satellite, but also high torsional stiffness. An example is shown in Figure 4.1.7.",True,3
What assembly techniques were commonly used in the construction of early satellites to create lightweight structures?,"Differential Construction Differential construction is the most traditional form for lightweight structures. In the early years of the space age most satellites were built “differentially”: that is, by combining simple preformed components made of conventional materials, for instance shells and profiles made from aluminum sheets which were subsequently connected by rivets or screws, similar to aircraft construction of that time..

What makes the integration of spacecraft components particularly costly and time consuming?,"quantities, this aspect is less relevant for spacecraft construction. On the other hand, their integration is very time consuming and expensive, in particular if hundreds or thousands of rivets (or screws, or adhesive connections) are required to complete the structure as a whole (Figure 4.1.8).",True,3
What is the trade-off associated with resistance to crack propagation in components?,"The advantage of being relatively resistant to crack propagation (because cracks end at the edges of the individual components or at the bearings of the screw or rivet holes and do not propagate through the entire component) is offset by the relatively high weight. Therefore it is not surprising that during the last few decades, in view of the growing importance of modern fiber composites on the one hand, and the development of modern computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing techniques on the other hand, the traditional methods of differential construction have taken a back seat..

What defines monolithic construction compared to differential construction?,"Monolithic Construction The philosophy pursued in monolithic (or “integral”) construction is just the opposite of the approach usedFigure 4.1.8: Skin and stringer in a differential construction.in differential construction: ideally the whole struc- ture consists of a single monolithic piece, or is at least composed of only a few large parts.",True,2
What manufacturing method is primarily used for monolithic metallic structures?,"If monolithic metallic structures are considered, the only really feasible production technique is manuf- acturing from the solid by means of CNC tools. Such monolithic parts are much cheaper and easier to produ- ce today than in the early days of the space age, and also the achievable precision is much higher. The theoretical alternative for producing monolithic metallic parts by casting is practically irrelevant for space structure technology, apart from rare exceptional cases.. ",True,3
What advantages do sandwich panels have over monolithic structures in terms of weight for large dimensions?,"Certainly it is true that for large dimensions, structures composed of sandwich panels are clear- ly lighter in weight than corresponding “integral” monolithic structures because milling and grinding from the solid material cannot be accomplished to achieve such extremely thin wall thicknesses as are possible with sandwiches. This is also true for so-called isogrid structures where panels are stiffened on their back side by a monolithically connected network of stringers (ribs), preferably with equilateral triangles in between (i.e., all angles are 60°).

What manufacturing method is commonly used for creating compact structures from aluminum?,"For smaller and more compact structures, however, the monolithic construction method is well established.

What challenges arise when manufacturing sandwich panels with one-dimensional and two-dimensional curvature?,"with sandwich construction even for larger dimensi- ons.

What manufacturing method allows the creation of a negative form curved in two dimensions?,"On the other hand, there is no problem at all in precisely manufacturing a negative form curved in two dimensions using a CNC machine and to use it subsequently as a lamination mold. As long as the required wall thickness is no larger than several mil- limeters, skilled personnel can manufacture structural parts of high quality on such a mold even by simple hand lamination (Figure 4.1.9), because the homo- geneous interpenetration of fiber material and liquid lamination resin (epoxy) can be directly observed. The readily hardened curved shell can later be stiffened with stringers that are glued on.. ",True,3
What is the significance of controlling flux behavior and viscosity in resin transfer molding?,"For structures with thicker walls, however, auto- matically controlled injection techniques are required, such as the different varieties of resin transfer mold- ing (RTM) [4.1.16], [4.1.17], [4.1.18]. In this tech- nique the flux behavior and the viscosity of the resin are actively controlled, and precise pressure levels are used to make sure that the fiber layers or fabrics are homogeneously wetted by the lamination resin even to large depths.

What is a significant consequence of outgassing in spacecraft environments?,"The high vacuum leads to a mass loss of all structural materials which contain volatiles. This does not con- cern metals, but all plastic materials including fiber composites. Since the corresponding external vapor pressure is zero, these materials lose their volatiles, primarily water molecules, by outgassing. This de- hydration may not just lead to critical embrittlement of the material itself. Even more critical is the subse- quent condensation of the volatiles on other parts of the spacecraft, for instance on camera lenses, mirrors and other sensitive sensor surfaces, which can blind their field of view..

Immediately prior to and after the outgassing phase the sample is weighed so that the total mass loss (TML) can be determined.

What factors influence the estimated lifetime dose for spacecraft concerning material degradation?,"In view of the material degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation and high-energy particles which may gradually destroy molecular bonds in the ma- terial, it is necessary to estimate the lifetime dose to which the spacecraft will be exposed.

What issues might arise from laminating metallic foils on carbon fiber laminate due to differing thermal expansion coefficients?,"Another option is to laminate thin protective me- tallic foils directly on carbon fiber laminate surfaces.

What role does a metallic surface play in preventing local electric charge concentrations on spacecraft?,"A conductive and well-reflecting metallic surface not only is a very valuable protection of the structural material below against degradation, but moreover prevents local electric charge concentrations on the structure.

What external factor is responsible for the generation of atomic oxygen in low Earth orbit?,"Finally, for missions in a low Earth orbit it should be considered whether atomic oxygen might have a degrading effect (for all other trajectories this can certainly be neglected from the outset). Atomic oxygen is generated by the dissociation of oxygen molecules in the highest parts of the atmosphere by solar UV radiation, where the influence of the solar activity cyc- les increases sharply with increasing altitude [4.1.23]. ",True,3
What risk does atomic oxygen pose specifically to carbon fiber elements?,"In particular, carbon fiber structures are sensitive to atomic oxygen, but practical experience has shown that a normal satellite structure does not accumulate so much damage during its lifetime that the effect will become dangerous. For smaller parts, however, and for certain sensor structures in particular, the effect of atomic oxygen should not be neglected.. ",True,3
How can screw nuts be attached to a traditionally manufactured structure?,"For the fixation of payload boxes, service units of other subsystems, and all kind of secondary structures on the primary structure, a large number of screwing points are needed. In the case of a monolithically manufactured (“integral”) structure it is possible to drill holes into the material, to tap suitable threads into them and to optionally apply helicoils.

What are the two types of inserts used in spacecraft structures for fastening?,"on spacecraft structures and can be classified into two basic forms: so-called through-the-thickness inserts, which go through the whole sandwich panel, so that the screw head and the unit to be fastened are on opposite sides; and the alternative version, so-called blind inserts, which involve unilateral inserts where the screw and the unit remain on the same side.",True,2
What procedure is used to embed a unilateral blind insert in a sandwich panel?,"Both basic versions exist in various technical forms [4.1.24]. The standard form of a unilateral blind insert is embedded in the sandwich panel by the so-called potting procedure (see Figure 4.1.13, center). At first a borehole is drilled which is a bit deeper than the metallic insert element, but equal in diameter. Opti- onally the honeycomb cells touched by the drill are then closed at their remaining upper edge with some pasty epoxy resin so that, upon the following injection of liquid resin, this cannot flow into the “depths” of the sandwich.

What is the range of screws that can be fastened by the described insert type?,"After implementation and alignment of the insert by means of an appropriate tool, liquid resin is injected through one of two holes in the insert cap, until the hollow space in the borehole around the central insert shank is completely filled and the resin pours out of the second hole.

For most insert types, however, it is also possible to let the insert cap protrude above the face sheet (protruding inserts), as shown for comparison in Figure 4.1.14. The latter option allows for later collective abrasion of all inserts implemented in the same panel up to a common interface plane above the sandwich surface. Any local unevenness of the sandwich can thus be corrected.. ",True,2
What type of screws are typically used for fixation in space structures?,"All inserts must be implemented into the structure such that they cannot loosen during assembly and integration when the screws are tightened with the appropriate torque specified for the respective thread size. For fixation on space structures it is customary to use titanium screws (e.g., TiAI6V4) with a rolled thread and a hexagonal socket screw head.

What is the purpose of mechanical ground support equipment in spacecraft integration?,"During the following integration the structure must be freely accessible, and its attitude must be adjustable in any desired position relative to the ground.

What role do secondary structures play in the mechanical properties of a spacecraft?,"Secondary structures differ from primary structure by not determining the “global” mechanical properties of the spacecraft as a whole. Rather they only govern the local behavior of the on-board systems or pay- loads that are fastened onto them. Nevertheless, their geometrical forms and sizes are such that they ought to be represented in the finite element model of the spacecraft in an identifiable manner, and their mecha- nical behavior ought to be explicitly analyzed.

What mechanism is used to connect individual elements in the described system?,"The individual elements are connected by spring- driven hinges which open after unlocking in space and latch as soon as they have reached the unfolded state (see Section 4.1.5.3). Until just prior to launch, that is until the fairing is set on top of the launcher, it is usual to protect each batch of stowed solar panels by an additional protective cover panel in order to avoid accidental damage of the solar cells (see the enlarged display window in Figure 4.1.19).. ",True,3
What role do launch locks play in the mechanical behavior of solar panels during launch?,Solar panels consist of relatively lightweight sand- wich plates on which the solar cell arrays and the corresponding harness are glued. Under the dynamic loading during launch their mechanical behavior depends mainly on their firmly latching in the launch locks (see Section 4.1.5.1).

What type of vibrations can be induced by minor disturbances in flight maneuvers?,"Even very small accelerations generated by flight maneuvers or minor disturbances can, under such circumstances, induce low-frequency vibrations in the order of 1 Hz.

What factors influence the structural behavior during the launch of a boom with spring-driven hinges?,"If such a boom consists of rigid links with spring- driven hinges in between, then its structural mecha- nics are basically the one-dimensional variant of the batch of solar panels described above. The behavior of the stowed configuration during launch depends primarily on the quality and the position of the launch locks, while the dynamic behavior of the configuration in its unfolded state is determined by the mechanical properties of the boom links themselves, by the mass of the deployed payload (e.g., a magnetometer) and by the stiffness of the hinges..

What are the characteristics of gossamer structures used for deploying large structures in space?,"One particular challenge is booms for the dep- loyment of really large, ultralight structures such as solar sails, huge antennas or reflectors, or even solar cell arrays which are no longer deployed in the con- ventional manner by means of rigid elements, but by a flexible carrier which achieves its final contour only after having been unfolded in space.

What was a key requirement for the design of booms in solar sail spacecraft development?,"In the course of a joint technology study conducted by ESA, DLR and industrial partners, and aimed at the development of a future solar sail spacecraft which would be propelled only by the pressure of the solar radiation on a large reflective foil and could thus undertake long-term missions in the Solar System, ul- tralight booms had to be developed. It was mandatory to stow these booms during the integration and launch phases in a very small stowage volume [4.1.28].. ",True,3
What is the structural configuration of each boom comprising the thin-walled curved CFRP shells?,"As depicted in Figure 4.1.20, each boom consists of two long, unrollable, very thin-walled curved CFRP shells, the half-circled profiles of which are the mirror image of their respective counterpart. In the absence of external forces, these shells unfold under the influ- ence of internal stresses that have been “frozen” during hardening, and form a long tube with two sideward flanges. Such a tube can be compressed to a flat ribbon and rolled up on a spool like a tape measure. ",True,3
What initiates the unfolding process after unwinding stored deformation energy?,"Upon unwinding, the stored deformation energy initiates the unfolding. By means of a suitable mechanism several booms can be radially deployed out of a central body and simultaneously unfold a thin sail foil or another ultralight device [4.1.29], [4.1.30], [4.1.31].. ",True,3
What structural property is primarily relied upon for the load-bearing capability of thin-walled booms?,"Since these booms are very thin walled, their load- bearing capability depends primarily on their buckling stiffness, for which a laminate based on a combina- tion of 0° and 45° fiber layers is very advantageous. Moreover, this lay-up sequence helps to minimize the deformation of the boom under unilateral thermal irradiation in space. Very low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) in the longitudinal direction are. ",True,3
What is the specific weight measurement of the boom described in grams per meter?,decisive. The specific weight of the boom is in the order of 100 g/m.,True,2
What thermal transfer method is most influential on booms due to their large surface-to-mass ratio?,"The dominating thermal effect on such booms is heat transfer by radiation, because their surface is huge in relation to their mass. Therefore future applications will decisively depend on a suitable surface coating which is anyway necessary as a protective shield against degradation. The use of coated Kapton foil is already proven, at least on shorter boom sections. Also, the deployment concept as such was successfully tested in the course of a large-scale on-ground demonstra- tion in 1999, where a solar sail with four booms each 14 m long was unfolded [4.1.30], [4.1.31]..

How can a finite element model be developed from an existing CAD model?,"The generation of a suitable FE model can be fa- cilitated if a CAD model already exists from which it can be derived. Thus it may not be necessary to model the whole geometry of the structure from scratch. However, the designer’s view is sometimes different from the view of the engineer responsible for the structural analysis. For instance, a thin-walled shell structure may be ideally represented in the FE model by shell elements, based on which the numerical ap- proach is two dimensional, namely superposition of a plate-bending stiffness and a membrane stiffness. ",True,4
What elements might a CAD designer prefer to use for generating technical drawings and manufacturing requirements?,"The CAD designer, however, may prefer to work with “solids,” that is with volume elements, because the ge- neration of technical drawings and the manufacturing requirements necessitate this approach. In any case the conversion of a CAD model into a FE model must be examined very critically.. ",True,3
How does mesh resolution affect accuracy in finite element method calculations?,"It is obvious that the accuracy achievable with FEM calculations depends on the mesh, that is on the resolution of details by a number of elements. Since a very fine mesh leads to strongly increased modeling and calculation effort, it is restricted to the vicinity of critical interfaces, essential load paths and other important areas. On the other hand, for parts of the structure where “nothing happens,” for instance areas in the interior of large plates, a coarse mesh is sufficient.. ",True,4
What is the assumption made for the representation of light and small units in the structural model?,"Of course the FE model of a spacecraft structure must always include the mounted system and payload units. A mechanical analysis of the “naked” structure would be senseless. Relatively light and small units (tertiary structures) can be represented by the ide- alized assumption that their mass is concentrated at their CoG which is connected to certain nodes on the structural mesh (close to the real interface points) by rigid, but mass-less connections, so-called rigid beam elements (RBEs), see Figure 4.1.22 below..

What is required from suppliers of heavy units for integration into spacecraft models?,"Relatively heavy and critical units, on the other hand, need a detailed representation in the FE model.

What issue arose from the mass increase in the battery rack of the Rosetta lander?,"An example is the battery rack on the instrument carrier of the Rosetta lander, as depicted in Figure 4.1.21 (center). Originally the battery had been ide- alized in the same simplified manner as shown in Figure 4.1.22, until a significant mass increase led to a negative margin of safety (MoS, see Section 4.1.3.3) at several battery fixation points and to critical dy- namic behavior.

What are the examples of components classified as nonstructural mass due to their negligible stiffness contribution?,"Masses which are difficult to localize or do not contribute anything to the stiffness of the structure are treated as nonstructural mass, for instance foils, MLI, harnesses, or solar cell arrays.

What fundamental principle relates stress and strain in linear materials?,"For practical calculations the FE model is fed with the relevant material parameters, such as the different elasticity and shear moduli, so that all properties are reduced to values assigned to the nodes of the mesh.

Such a system of equations may be quite com- prehensive, but the underlying physics is in the simp- lest case a linear stress-strain relation, that is Hooke’s law. ",True,3

For the purposes of structural mechanics, however, they are less suitable than the FEM. The FDM is very ap- plicable for the calculation of transient temperature distributions, and for this function it is also established in space technology (see Section 4.3). The BEM is advantageous for some special problems, for instance the determination of stress concentrations on crack tips or notch tips. ",True,3
What type of models reflect the actual physical arrangement of a structure?,"The above-mentioned FE models are also defined as physical FE models because they represent (with more or less accuracy) the real physical configuration of the structure.

What method is used to derive modal models from the physical FE model for dynamic analyses?,For static analyses the physical FE model of the embedded unit can be replaced by a reduced stiff- ness matrix.

What is necessary to introduce for validation when neither a fine mesh nor a rigid connection suffices?,"In these cases it is not sufficient to rely on a very fine mesh alone, nor is it admissible to simply presu- me a completely rigid connection. Rather, a spring constant must be introduced which cannot be reliably validated until the structural tests have been evalua- ted (Figure 4.1.24).

In this test the frequency is slowly (e.g., at 2 octaves per minute) swept from almost zero up to 2000 Hz, so that the resonance curve can be determined. ",True,2
What is the maximum frequency limit for real loading test runs during amplitude excitation?,"Subsequently the excitation amplitude is stepwise increased up to the qualification level (Q-level); however, these real loading test runs are usually limited to frequencies up to 100 Hz.. ",True,3
What does a shift in resonance peaks between two sine test curves indicate about a structure's integrity?,"Between all these intermediate-level or Q-level load tests, low-level sine tests are repeatedly perfor- med in order to verify the enduring integrity of the structure. A frequency shift of the resonance peaks between two low-level sine test curves recorded prior to and after a “real load” test would indicate internal damage, that is a progressing “softness” of the struc- ture. The frequency response curve (resonance curve) measured in the final low-level sine test for each axis then serves as the basis for the model updating of the FE model.. ",True,3
What values are used for excitation amplitudes in sine load tests across three axes?,"For sine load tests the required excitation ampli- tudes in the directions of all three axes are predefined2/24/09 3:39:36 PM 4.1 Structure and Mechanismsas effective values (root mean square, RMS) versus frequency with the acceleration of gravity as the unit, that is in gps (see Figure 4.1.26). Quasi-static loads are measured in multiples of gas well.",True,2
What unit is used to measure the required excitation for random and acoustic loads?,"Fora random load and acoustic load the required excitation in each axis is predefined as a power spec- tral density (PSD), which is pragmatically measured in g/Hz. The same approach is used for shock loads [4.1.34]. At least the random load tests are accompa- nied by preceding and succeeding low-level sine tests, as described above.",True,3
What is the term for the procedure of reducing excitation amplitude in response to critical resonance magnifications?,"In case of critical resonance magnifications it is allowed under certain circumstances to reduce the excitation amplitude on the Q-level in limited fre- quency intervals. The originally prescribed accelerati- on curve (scaled in gversus Hz) or PSD curve (scaled in g/Hz versus Hz) then gets a notch. Therefore, this procedure is quite pictorially called notching. It needs to be formally approved in each individual case by a “Test Review Board” appointed by the project management.. ",True,3
What is the relationship between the Q-level and the acceptance level in terms of their numerical values?,"The Q-level is usually 1.5 times higher than the so-called acceptance level (A-level), which still covers sufficiently safely the dynamic loads that can be really expected during launch.",True,2
What elements are tested on the flight model apart from sinusoidal and random loads?,"Other than the STM, the flight model (FM) is only tested on the A-level, but apart from that, the test procedures for the FM are the same. The FM is mounted on the shaker table in all three axis direc- tions (x, y, z) one after another (see Figure 4.1.25) and tested under the prescribed sine and random loads, repeatedly, with low-level sine tests in between. Acoustic tests and shock tests are optional, depending on the specific project requirements. For the FM they are often omitted in practice.. ",True,3
What is the primary function of mechanisms related to structural mechanics in spacecraft?,"The following considerations are confined to mecha- nisms which are directly connected with the structural mechanics of the spacecraft, for instance by serving to separate different segments from each other, to lock and unlock, or to deploy and actively position subs- tantial spacecraft parts. Mechanisms in the interior of payloads (e.g., inside scientific instruments), however, are not considered here.. ",True,2
What is a crucial attribute for space systems regarding human intervention?,"A basic requirement for spaceborne mechanisms is high autonomy or reliable functioning without any human assistance. Only in exceptional cases, for instance on the International Space Station (ISS) or on-board the Space Shuttle, astronauts are present who could help a jamming mechanism along. In most other cases, however, there is no chance to intervene, and a failing mechanism can well be hazardous for the whole mission.. ",True,3
What is essential for mechanisms used in extraterrestrial missions to ensure functionality after extended periods in space?,"While for many mechanisms designed for nonre- curring use the holding time from launch to release is short (minutes, hours, or a couple of days at the most), tilting or positioning drives must often remain continuously operable under space conditions for many years. In the case of extraterrestrial missions the criterion of long-term reliability is also mandatory for separation, unlocking and spring mechanisms, which must immediately function at the target of the missi- on even after a long cruise flight and under extreme environmental conditions.. ",True,4
What are the main components or characteristics of mechanisms that operate based on heat transfers or thermal changes?,4.1.5.1 Pyromechanisms,True,3
What is the term used for devices that separate rigid connections in spacecraft?,"Pyromechanical separation mechanisms serve for the fast and reliable separation of different spacecraft segments from each other, or for the transection of cables and ropes. In the case of rigid connections they are referred to as pyrobolts, while for the transection of cables and ropes the terms cablecutter or pyroknife are customary. All of them are sometimes summarized by the term ordnance devices.. ",True,3
What is the role of the explosive charge in the described mechanisms?,"The constructive diversity of such mechanisms, which are commercially available, is rather large. In all cases a small explosive charge is ignited in a reaction chamber so that the explosion pressure can act via a piston (or the equivalent of a piston) ona cutting tool, by which a rigid bolt or a cable can be transected.",True,3
What is the primary purpose of larger pyrobolts in launch systems?,"‘Since an explosive charge generates very large forces or pressures, the mechanism can be quite small for most applications in space technology. The largest pyrobolts are generally needed to separate the different stages of the launcher.",True,3
What aspect of pyrobolts determines their effectiveness in rocket stage separation?,"For the latter purpose also the second characteris- tic of pyrobolts (apart from the high forces released) becomes decisive, namely the short duration of the reaction.

What type of devices are necessary for achieving synchronous firing according to the context?,these must be fired synchronously. This synchrony is only realistically feasible by means of pyromechanical devices.,True,2
What can be affected by shock waves generated during ignition in spacecraft?,"Upon ignition shock waves in the structure are inevitably generated which, in the frequency range of several kilohertz, can reach an amplitude of several thousand g. Typical of the “far field” at some distance from the pyrodevice is a rise in amplitude up to a “knee frequency” of approximately 5 kHz with a sub- sequent amplitude decay [4.1.34]. Within the analysis and qualification of the spacecraft these shock waves must necessarily be considered. In particular, sensitive instruments can easily be damaged by shock waves and may need a damping bearing [4.1.35].. ",True,4
What type of devices were primarily used in the design of the airbag for the project's Mars landing concept?,Figure 4.1.27 shows the deployment concept of an airbag designed for the landing on Mars (NetLander project [4.1.20]). The concept was derived from a previous development of the Babakin Company for the Russian Mars-96 mission and was based solely on pyromechanical devices.,True,3
What device is used to cut the parachute line before landing on Mars?,"Both calottes of the airbag which surround the landing probe are laced up to a single sphere. Af- ter transection of the parachute line by means of a pyroknife on the upper side and touchdown on the Martian surface, a pyrobolt releases all the ropes",True,2
What process involves the transection of ropes and straps in the landing probe's interior?,"4 Subsystems of Spacecraftsurrounding the sphere in one fell swoop, which initi- ates the immediate bellying of the calottes. The subse- quent pyromechanical transection of ropes and straps in the interior, which circumferentially surround the landing probe, accomplishes the landing process.",True,2
What is the main purpose of pyromechanical unlocking mechanisms in deployment systems?,"Apart from separation mechanisms in the lite- ral sense, there are also pyromechanical unlocking mechanisms, in particular pinpullers, since a large portion of all launch locks of panels, booms, anten- nas, etc., is based on pins which hold a spring-driven or motor-driven deployment mechanism by form- locking contact. Here it is decisive to pull the locking pin reliably and without jamming of its counter-bea- ring so that the deployment can occur unimpeded.. ",True,2
What type of pinpullers is preferred for synchronous unlocking at multiple locations?,"If the unlocking must occur at several locations synchronously, then pyromechanically driven pinpul- lers are often preferred in order to avoid having the deploying structure free on one side while it is still locked on the other side, which might lead to jamming or hazardous dangling movements.",True,3
What drives the reaction in the chamber of pyromechanical pinpullers?,"The external shape of pyromechanical pinpullers is in most cases quite similar to that of pinpullers with a nonexplosive drive (Figure 4.1.28). The reac- tion takes place in a cylindrical chamber, after which a bolt is abruptly pulled behind or pressed out of a flange plate.",True,2
What is the protocol for arming pyromechanical devices before launch?,"All pyromechanical devices are subject to par- ticular safety regulations and may be armed only immediately prior to launch. On satellites and space probes it is often only allowed to install them in this phase, replacing the nonhazardous placeholders. In any case they require special access conditions.Figure 4.1.28: Pinpuller (schematic).2/25/09 12:28:13 PM 4.1 Structure and Mechanisms",True,3

What mechanism allows bolts or ropes to be transected using pressure in nonexplosive actuators?,"If a short reaction time, or synchrony in the case of several release locations, is not a prime criterion, then nonexplosive actuators can also be used. Similar to pyromechanically driven devices but much slower, a chemical reaction is ignited in their reaction chamber, or a phase transition is initiated, which pressurizes a piston or something equivalent. By means of this pres- sure, bolts or ropes can be transected, but also locking pins can be pulled. Shock loads are avoided.. ",True,3
What type of actuators were used in the four separation adapters of the spacecraft?,"For instance, the four separation adapters of the Rosetta lander schematically depicted in Figure 4.1.24 were so-called nonexplosive actuators (NEAs) which had to transect screw connections with M9 thread. The transection was performed shortly after launch in order to avoid the risk of thermoelastic stresses which could, after 10 years of cruise flight in space, possibly lead to jamming. Nevertheless this transection of the four main load paths between orbiter and lander was not the same as an immediate physical separation. Both spacecraft units remained connected to each other by a light holding mechanism (cruise latch).. ",True,2
What material is typically contained within the cylindrical chamber of a wax motor?,"One of the most reliable types of pinpullers with a nonexplosive drive is the so-called wax motor (see Figure 4.1.29). A cylindrical chamber contains solid paraffin in which a heating element is embedded, mostly a PTC thermistor, optionally in duplicate. Upon melting, the paraffin expands and presses with a high force against a piston which acts in turn on the actuator pin. Depending on the construction, the pin can be eit- her retracted or pushed forward. ",True,3
"Which type of motors outperform electromagnetically driven pinpullers in terms of generated force, size, and safety against jamming?","Suitable mechanical deflections allow for all kinds of unlocking movements. Of course there are also electromagnetically driven pinpullers. However, with respect to the generated force in relation to the required electric current, the size, and safety against jamming, wax motors are clearly superior as long as the velocity is uncritical.. ",True,3
What are pinpullers and launch locks now available as?,"Pinpullers and other types of launch locks are to- day commercial available as commercial off the shelf (COTS) products in a broad variety of forms, and need no longer be developed for a specific mission.4.1.5.3 Spring Mechanisms",True,1
What type of springs are typically released by pinpullers to allow for the deployment of connected units?,"The above-mentioned pinpullers are very often symbi- otically connected to spring mechanisms, where they unlock a prestressed compression spring or torsion spring and thus permit deployment of the attached unit (boom, panel, antenna, etc.).",True,2
What is the maximum torque generated by the torsion spring in the hinge?,"The torsion-spring-driven hinge depicted in Figure 4.1.30 is a typical example. It was developed by the Pfeil Trawid Company [4.1.36] for a Mars landing probe (NetLander project [4.1.20]), for the deployment of its solar array petals that were stacked upon each other. The torsion spring has a diameter of 21.8 mm, a length of 32 mm and generates a maximum torque of 2.1 N m. The whole hinge weighs 68 g.. ",True,3

What mechanism is included in the hinge to mitigate strong oscillations during operation?,"Since the moved component (in this example the unfolding solar array petal that is fastened on the upper flange) is accelerated during the rotational movement of the spring, it could hit the stopper with maximum velocity, that is with maximum angular momentum, which would result in strong oscillations, probably even damage. Therefore the torsion-spring- driven hinge contains in its interior a torsional brake which becomes progressively effective with increasing opening angle.. ",True,4
What mechanism is utilized to compress a Belleville spring washer in a damped system?,As shown in the exploded view (Figure 4.1.31) the opening of the torsion spring is accompanied by the co-rotation of a cam-guided cylinder in a guiding slee- ve which compresses a Belleville spring washer such that the rotational movement is effectively damped until the final position (latching position) is reached. Spring hinges of this type are well proven in space technology.,True,3

How are the spring mechanisms for solar panels unlocked when they are spaced apart?,"in the case of sequential unfolding of solar panels) the spring mechanisms and their unlocking devices must be effectively switchable in series. If the moving parts are somewhat distant from each other then each individual spring-driven hinge will be released by a pinpuller (driven pyromecha- nically, electromagnetically or by a wax motor) and the individual steps of the release sequence will be controlled electrically. ",True,3
What component triggers the unlocking of the subsequent panel or boom link upon full unfolding?,"For instance, upon complete unfolding of a panel or boom link, the unlocking of the next one can be triggered by an end switch. If the moving parts are in close contact, then the control can also be purely mechanical. In the above- mentioned example of the sequential radial deploy- ment of the solar array petals of a small Mars landing probe, each petal bears a spigot on the inner side of the flange of the torsion-spring-driven hinge which locks the subjacent petal in the stowed configuration. ",True,3
What mechanism allows the subjacent petal to be released when the hinge reaches a specific angle?,"As soon as the hinge has opened up to a certain angle, the subjacent petal is released (Figure 4.1.32). Spring-driven hinges can also be combined with electrical hinge drives. The stack of solar array petals developed for the above-mentioned NetLander pro- ject was covered by a much more massive outer lid which served not only as solar array carrier, but also. ",True,3
What drives are necessary for the lid movement if the torque required for uprighting is significantly higher?,"as bearing area for a possibly necessary uprighting movement (see Figure 4.1.11). The hinge drive for this outer lid had of course to be electrical, because the necessary uprighting torque was 25 times higher than the torque required for the lid opening only. However, the latter case was the nominal one, because the nominal landing attitude was upright.",True,3
What component was added to prevent single point failure in the hinge mechanism?,"In order not to make mission success in the no- minal case (upright position) conditional on the functioning of the motor-driven hinge (i.e., to avoid a so-called single point failure) the hinge axis was additionally equipped with a torsion spring drive which could at least open the lid in the case of a motor failure (see Figure 4.1.33).",True,3

What material is used for the gearwheel that receives the torsional moment from the motor?,"First, the motor itself carries a planetary gear which ends in a gearwheel made of titanium. It trans- fers its torsional moment to a larger gearwheel made of PEEK in the second step of the gear reduction. Thanks to the material combination titanium/PEEK, friction problems between the two gearwheels are practically excluded. The third and fourth stages of the gear reduction are winches which spool a 1.6 mm thick Dyneema string. ",True,2
What is the primary mechanical function of winches in systems needing high torque with limited movement?,"In this application, where in the final stage large torques are required but short pulling distances are sufficient (because the hinge axis rotates only once by 180°), winches are much more.

What benefits do motor-driven winch-based gears with torsion springs offer over traditional gearwheel mechanisms?,"Figure 4.1.33: Motor-driven winch-based gear with additional torsion springs (Source: Pfeil Trawid).advantageous than gearwheel mechanisms.

What types of drives are suitable for bidirectional operation in space applications?,"It is evident that such winch-based gears are only suited for one-way mechanisms. For tilting and posi- tioning drives which must work continuously and in both directions, gearwheel drives or worm gears are used, which differ from comparable terrestrial ones only by their particularly lightweight design and by the specific tribological aspects which must be considered in space (see Section 4.1.5.7)..

What are the four primary categories used to classify electric motors in space mechanisms?,The electric motors which are commonly used in space mechanisms can be classified in four main categories [4.1.37]:2/24/09 3:39:45 PM CHO04.indd Sec1:228,True,3
What are the primary components of a DC motor that uses brush contact for torque generation?,"1. DC motors with brush contact for the generation of substantial torques.

This very conventional configuration is suitable as a“workhorse” for a very limited duration, because brush contacts under space conditions become very quickly unusable.",True,3
What is a characteristic feature of brushless DC motors in terms of rotation and complexity?,"2.

What type of motor does not require a commutator and has coils in the stationary component?,"3. Brushless DC motors which need no commuta- tor because the coils are part of the nonrotating motor component. Although this construction is known as a “continuous-rotation, brushless DC motor” (BDC motor), it is strictly speaking work- ing with alternating current because it partitions the applied direct current into phases according to the angular position of the axis [4.1.37]. The big advantage of this construction is its relative insensitivity to the environmental conditions in space. ",True,3

What role does the embedding structure play in the function of a piezoceramic actuator?,Figure 4.1.34 shows schematically the embed- ment of a piezoceramic actuator in a CFRP laminate [4.1.38]. Only in this rigidly embedded form can the extremely brittle piezoceramic material (in this case PZT) be prevented from fracture and become operable at all.

What limits the suitability of passive carrier structures for optical mirrors in astronomy?,"Optical mirrors for astronomical applications (space telescopes, interferometry) or for use as laser reflectors must have extremely precise contours.

Two small compact masses are connected by ropes to two diametrically opposed points on the cylindrical satellite structure. ",True,3
What causes the masses to be propelled away in this system?,"Initially the ropes are spooled on the structure and the masses are locked with a launch lock. As soon as this is released in orbit, the masses are centrifugally flung off as the ropes unwind. Finally the largest portion of the spin is transferred onto the distantly revolving masses, and the satellite itself rotates only slowly.

What design feature of the rotor in momentum and flywheels maximizes the moment of inertia?,Flywheels and momentum wheels are commercial- ly available as COTS in many forms and sizes. Figure 4.1.37 shows a typical design. The rotor is formed such that its circumferential cylindrical wall contains the largest portion of the mass in order to maximize the Mol. The inner parts are as light as possible; here any additional mass would be wasted. Such flywheels are mostly driven by BDC motors (see Section 4.1.5.4).

The input variables of a tribosystem are load and speed, while friction and wear are the output variables. A simplified version of the laws of friction is stated below:",True,3
What does the relationship Fp = H Fy indicate in terms of friction and normal force?,1. The friction is proportional to the normal force. The relationship between frictional force Fp and normal force Fy defines a friction coefficient p (Fp =H Fy).,True,3
What effect does the contact surface area have on frictional force?,2. The frictional force is independent of the size of the contact surface.3. The frictional force is independent of the speed.,True,3
What factors influence friction generation between surfaces?,"Friction is generated by adhesion and abrasion between the surfaces involved, and is influenced by their hardness, elasticity and roughness. The above formulated laws of friction are a simplification valid under the assumption that both the measuring peri- ods and the scales are sufficiently large. If short-term phenomena (occurring in milli-, micro- or nanose- conds) or measurements in the micro- or nanometer range are considered, then the validity of these laws is limited. ",True,3
What phenomenon describes the changes in the friction coefficient due to environmental conditions such as vacuum and atmosphere?,"This is known as the scale dependency of the laws of friction. Deviations are also observed under vacuum conditions, where the friction coefficient may drastically increase or fluctuate, while under atmospheric conditions the surface is always covered by a protective oxide and adsorption layer, which also regulates the friction process. Tribological materials should not just have a low friction coefficient, rather also the fluctuations of this coefficient across the life span of the system should be low. ",True,4
What design consideration is crucial for achieving low friction in drive systems?,"Drives need to be designed for the maximal frictional resistance occur- ring, so that a permanently low friction coefficient makes it possible to build weight-saving drives. The independence of the friction from speed does not exist for fluids where the internal friction increases with speed. Therefore, tribosystems which are lubri- cated with liquid lubricants have a speed-dependent friction.. ",True,3
What are the alternative causes of wear in a tribological system besides friction and abrasion?,"Apart from friction, wear is the second important parameter for the description of a tribological system. Like friction, wear can be caused by adhesion and abrasion, but also other forms, such as wear caused by fatigue, erosion or tribochemical reactions, are known. Both wear and friction are system properties",True,3
What factors increase wear in tribosystems according to the text?,"which can be disproportionately influenced by the variation of other system properties. Generally, wear increases with load, is proportional to the wearing distance, and decreases with growing hardness of the surfaces involved. In addition to the material and geometrical characteristics of the friction partners, the lubricant is another important design element that influences friction and wear. For tribosystems in space technology it is mandatory to retest them after every modification of the construction or of the operational conditions, because the complexity even of simple tribosystems is still too high to accurately predict friction and wear effects under space condi- tions with today’s calculation tools.. ",True,3
What factors distinguish tribological systems in space from those on Earth?,"Tribological systems in space technology are a focal point of engineering research, because there are certain particularities compared to terrestrial tribo- systems, for instance the operation in high vacuum, the influence of large temperature gradients and of radiation, and the vibrational launch loads. While the environmental pressure in the geostationary orbit lies at 10°? mbar, this value may grow in the close vicinity of a satellite to approximately 107'° mbar due to the outgassing of materials. ",True,4
What characteristics are essential for materials used in space applications regarding their behavior in a vacuum?,"Therefore space materials must be qualified for use in a vacuum; that is, they must have an outgassing rate as low as possible and be as resistant as possible against degradation by radia- tion or highly energetic particles (see Section 4.1.1.4 above). While metals usually satisfy these criteria, the use of polymers is more critical since monomers and additives can easily escape. This is also the case for any lubricants used. Either dry lubricants or high molecular liquids with limited vaporization should therefore be used.. ",True,3
How do temperature variations influence the choice of liquid lubricant in spacecraft mechanisms?,"When the spacecraft rotates, or when it passes through an eclipse, temperature differences of up to 100 K can easily occur. This has to be considered not only with respect to the design of mechanisms and bearings, but also for the selection of an adequate liquid lubricant, because liquids are strongly affected by large temperature gradients. Oil-based lubricants harden under low temperatures, whereas high tem- peratures accelerate the evaporation process, which can lead to a drying up of the lubricant. ",True,4
How can thermal vacuum tests be utilized in assessing the effects of vacuum and temperature on friction resistance?,"Certainly the influence of vacuum and temperature on the friction resistance can be investigated by thermal vacuum tests (TV tests), but long-term prediction of the frictional.

What forces act on bearings in orbit due to acceleration?,"Mechanical loads in orbit are usually lower than on the ground due to the absence of gravity. Nevertheless, bearings are subject to inertia forces when the me- chanism is accelerated, and optionally to prestresses which may have been applied in order to protect the assembly parts during the launch phase. Otherwise the vibrations during launch may lead to damage",True,3

The",True,3
What type of bearings are typically used in solar array drives and gyroscopes for stabilization?,"fundamental distinction is between sliding bearings and rolling bearings. While simple, slowly moving or seldom/single-use mechanisms are usually equipped with sliding bearings, rolling bearings are preferred for permanently moving units. Accordingly, the hinges used for the deployment of solar array panels are equipped with sliding bearings, while for instance the drives in the solar array drive mechanisms (SADM, or BAPTA, respectively, see Section. 4.1.2.2) have rolling bearings, as well as gyros for energy storage or attitude stabilization.. ",True,3
What is the temperature range for AISI 440C depending on its thermal treatment?,"Suitable materials for tribologically stressed as- sembly parts are selected metals, polymers, compo- sites and ceramics. Since their qualification requires considerable effort it is preferable to use already well-known and proven materials, for instance har- dened steels such as AISI 52100 (100Cr6) or AISI 440C (102CrMo17). AISI 440C is a corrosion-resis- tant aerospace steel which, depending on its thermal treatment, covers a temperature range from —270 to +300 °C. ",True,3
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nitrogen-alloyed steels compared to aluminum and titanium alloys?,"Also, innovative nitrogen-alloyed steels such as X30CrMoN15.1 are used, which are quite resistant to wear effects in rolling bearing contacts and already proven in aerospace applications. Steels excel in their strength, ductility, hardness and ease of processing, while their disadvantage is their relatively high weight. Aluminum and titanium alloys are lighter but, due to their low hardness, suitable only for tribological pur- poses if the surface has a protective layer against wear.. ",True,3
"What phenomenon occurs easily with titanium in vacuum environments, impacting its friction properties?","4 Subsystems of SpacecraftThis is particularly true for titanium, which shows a broad scatter of the friction coefficient under vacuum conditions and easily tends to cold-welding. Tribolo- gically used assembly parts made from titanium are either lubricated or coated.",True,3
What types of coatings are used to protect soft-metal alloys in rolling bearings?,"Soft-metal alloys, like bronze or brass, are used for the cages of rolling bearings. In order to minimize wear of such soft metals a protective layer of titanium carbide (TiC), titanium nitrite (TiN), tungsten car- bide (WC), diamond-like carbon (DLC) or tungsten carbide/carbon (WC/C) can be used. Such layers are applied by PVD- or CVD-coating methods. Copper alloys (bronze, brass) are also used for sliding com- ponents which can be coated with soft-metal layers (silver, lead). An overview of the tribological materials and selection strategies used in space technology can be found in [4.1.44] and [4.1.46].. ",True,3
"What is the significance of employing lubrication in mechanical systems, particularly in relation to bearings?",4.1.5.7 Lubrication of Bearings and Mechanisms,True,2
What types of lubricants are distinguished based on their physical state in preventing unintended bonding in space?,"In space there is a high risk of unintentional welding between metallic surfaces because, other than in an atmosphere containing oxygen, there is no protective oxide layer, and also because impacting high-energy particles support the generation of local interatomic bonds. It is accordingly important to separate the surfaces with lubricants or layering systems. Basically, one can distinguish between dry lubricants and liquid lubricants. ",True,3
What factors influence the thickness of the lubricating film in liquid lubrication?,"Liquids create a lubricating film between the contact partners which regulates itself according to speed, viscosity and mechanical load. The minimum thickness of this film depends on the roughness of the surface. For metallic and ceramic surfaces the mean value of roughness is usually between 0.02 and 0.1 ym. In principle the surface should be as smooth as possible; however, it is observed that for roughnesses smaller than 0.05 xm the quality of the lubricating film can deteriorate. ",True,4
"What type of lubricants increase in viscosity under pressure, aiding surface separation in rolling bearings?",Lubricants where the viscosity increases under high pressure are known as shear thin- ning lubricants; they facilitate the separation of the surfaces even in highly stressed rolling bearings. The load in rolling bearings is transmitted across a very small surface of only a few square millimeters. The maximum compression occurring in the contact zone is known as Hertzian stress and reaches values up to 4000 N/mm2. Rolling bearings are usually operated in a range of 2000-3000 N/mm2. Under these conditions. ,True,3

What must be safely separated by the lubricating film in rolling element systems?,the lubricating film must safely separate the surfaces of rolling elements and runway. Suitable algorithms and computer programs for selecting an appropriate lubricant and calculating the required viscosity are available; see [4.1.42] and [4.1.46].,True,3
What describes the relationship between friction coefficient and rotational speed under constant conditions?,"The characteristic behavior of the friction coeffici- ent asa function of the (rotational) speed under con- stant load and viscosity can be described by a Stribeck curve (Figure 4.1.40). For liquid lubrication one can distinguish between dry friction (boundary lubrica- tion), mixed friction and the range of the completely separating lubricating film (hydrodynamic lubrica- tion). For many friction partners the transition from resting state to movement is coupled with a sudden decrease in friction. The force necessary to overcome the resting state is known as static friction.. ",True,3
What condition is crucial for minimizing the difference between static and sliding friction in dry lubricants?,"Dry lubricants are always used in the range of dry friction, where the difference between static and sliding friction must be as small as possible. Bearings operated in the range of hydrodynamic lubrication are practically free of wear. Nevertheless, due to aging processes in the lubricant itself, the life span of a fully lubricated bearing is limited; however, the estimation of a lubricant’s durability is difficult. ",True,3
What factors significantly influence the aging process of lubricants during durability tests?,Durability tests on lubricants are time consuming and sophisticated. The possibilities for quick tests are very limited since the operating conditions strongly affect aging.. ,True,3
What are the temperature ranges in which solid lubricants operate effectively?,"Table 4.1.4 compares the essential characteristics of dry and liquid lubricants; more detailed infor- mation can be found in [4.1.46]. Dry lubricants are used under either very high or very low temperatures. There is little risk that they could contaminate sur- rounding surfaces, and they can neither creep norTable 4.1.4: Comparison of dry and liquid lubricants.Dry lubricants quid lubricants",True,2

What methods are used to apply metal layers for reducing friction in assembly parts?,"wet any surrounding assembly parts. Their estimated life span can be determined by short-term tests and depends in particular on the acting load and the wear- ing distance. Typical dry lubricants used to improve friction behavior are soft-metal layers of silver, lead or gold, or layers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS,), polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) or graphite. Layers of metal can be applied galvanically or by physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating [4.1.47].. ",True,3
What is the mechanism by which MoS layers provide lubrication under compression?,"Dry lubricants such as MoS, can also be applied by PVD. This is a sputtering process where solid ma- terial is evaporated and accelerated in the direction of the substrate. The material condenses on the surface and forms a cohesive layer. Actively lubricating MoS, layers have a thickness of only a few micrometers. Like graphite, MoS, has a lamellar structure. Under compression the MoS, lamellae align in parallel and glide on each other, an effect which is observed in vacuum as well as under atmospheric conditions. ",True,4
How does the presence of humidity affect the friction coefficient of graphite-based dry lubricants?,"However, under atmospheric conditions the friction coefficient is several times larger than in vacuum, and the wear increases accordingly. Tests on MoS,-coated assembly parts are thus carried out under inert gas atmospheres (e.g., with nitrogen). An opposite effect can be observed with dry lubricants on a graphite base where the friction coefficient decreases in the presence of humidity. MoS, is therefore one of the most fre- quently used dry lubricants in space technology.. ",True,2

What must be verified through initial tests for MoS2-coated rolling bearing runways before installation?,"MoS, can be applied both automatically and manually. A soft cloth or brush is used to distribute the dry lubricant in powder form. It can be used for both rolling bearings and sliding contacts. Particularly for rolling bearings with MoS,-coated runways it is mandatory to check their friction coefficient by initial tests before they are finally installed. It takes some time before the MoS, lamellae are aligned under load and the friction reaches its minimum value, which is then maintained throughout the life span of the lubricant layer. ",True,4
What limits the durability of an MoS2 layer in bearings?,"The life span of an MoS, layer is limited by ab- rasive wear. Bearings with an MoS, coating are often equipped with cages which allow for dry lubrication as well (e.g., made of PTFE).. ",True,2
What is the effect of glass fibers on the properties of PTFE when used as a lubricant?,"Polymers suited for dry lubrication can be uti- lized for sliding contacts. PTFE is frequently used and can be reinforced optionally with glass fibers; in some cases it contains an admixture of MoS,. The low friction of PTFE-lubricated components can be explained by the transfer of a small amount of PTFE onto the opponent body (transfer lubrication). In a vacuum the friction coefficient remains practically invariant. ",True,3
What friction characteristic of PTFE makes it suitable for low initial resistance applications?,"Contrary to most other dry lubricants, PTFE has a static friction coefficient which is equal to the sliding friction coefficient. PTFE is therefore particularly suitable for moderately loaded, slowly moving mechanisms requiring low initial friction. It can be used for temperatures up to 280 °C and the compressive load should not exceed 800 N/mm?. Are- as of application include sliding bearings and hinges, but also rolling bearing cages because the latter are also subject to sliding strain. ",True,3
What is a disadvantage of polyimides compared to PTFE in applications?,"Apart from PTFE, poly- imides are also used, in particular for highly stressed components, but their sliding properties are worse than those of PTFE. Polyamides, on the other hand, are used only rarely. Polymers are used in most cases without any additional coating; however, their load- bearing capability is significantly lower than that of metallic materials.. ",True,3
What are the benefits of pairing ceramics with metals or polymers in minimizing wear?,"Current investigations are not only focused on an improved separation of the surfaces by means of dry lubricants, but also focused on material pairings based on different material classes, which helps to minimize adhesive wear. Pairings of ceramics and metals as well as of ceramics and polymers are particularly suited. Bearings composed of steel rings and ceramic rolling elements are called hybrid bearings (Figure 4.1.41)..

What impact did hybrid bearings have on the lifespan of turbopump bearings in the Space Shuttle?,"They can be operated with extremely small amounts of lubricant, and some of them can also operate in low-viscous media. Investigations on completely dry running bearings in a vacuum have proven that under certain circumstances hybrid bearings can operate even without any lubrication. In these cases the rolling elements are made of silicon nitride (Si;N,) or zirconium oxide (ZrO,). In the case of the Space Shuttle, for instance, the replacement of steel bearings in the turbopumps of the main engine by hybrid be- arings has increased the life span of these bearings by a factor of 60. ",True,4
What is the temperature at which the bearings operate in cryogenic liquid hydrogen?,"In this application the only lubricating medium is the propellant itself; that is, the bearings are operated in cryogenic liquid hydrogen at —253 °C. Research and development work focused on hybrid bearings in space mechanisms is ongoing.. ",True,2
What factors must be coordinated to ensure effective thick-film lubrication in bearings?,"Liquid lubricants are still indispensable for ap- plications where high reliability and durability are required and the speed is high. The design of the appropriate bearings is aimed at operation in the hydrodynamic (thick-film) lubrication range, for which the bearing size and geometry, load, rotational speed and lubrication need to be harmonized. Strong deviations from the optimal operating point lead to increased friction and wear if the bearing is operated in the mixed friction range. Lubricants for space ap- plications should have a minimum evaporation rate in vacuum. Hence high molecular and low-volatility. ",True,4
What is the importance of understanding structures in mechanical design?,2/24/09 3:40:05 PM 4.1 Structure and Mechanisms,True,3
What factors can accelerate the aging of PFPE lubricants in friction applications?,"lubricants are used, the most important ones being oils and greases based on perfluoropolyether (PFPE), occasionally also on polyalphaolefine (PAO). Con- ventional hydrocarbon lubricants are seldom used. Under certain conditions, however, PFPE lubricants tend to accelerate aging due to chemical reactions between the lubricant and the material of the fric- tion partners. Aging is additionally accelerated by operation in the mixed friction range, and by using aluminum and titanium surfaces, low-alloyed steels, high loads and high temperatures. ",True,4
What can help prevent creeping in PFPE lubricants during operation?,"In contrast the use of ceramics or high-alloyed steels, limited loads and moderate temperatures contribute to a pro- longation of the life span of PFPE lubricants. They have good adhesion on metallic surfaces and tend to creep. Creeping can be avoided by the construction of creep barriers (labyrinths) or by adhesive lacquers with a low surface energy.

How does increased temperature affect the voltage and current of a battery during discharge?,"increased performance, but at the same time the rate of the unwanted chemical reactions will increase, leading to a reduction in calendar life [4.2.8]. In addition, the negative temperature coefficient of the cell voltage at increased temperature causes a lower operating voltage. At constant power bus load and consequently at constant battery discharge power a reduction of the battery voltage increases the battery discharge current, and thereby also the DOD, since DOD isa function of the ampere-hours taken from the battery.

What can result from prolonged or frequent overcharging of Li-ion cells?,"Once all active chemicals are converted to stored energy during the charging process, which means that the battery is completely charged, any further charge energy applied to a battery cell will heat up the cell. If overcharging happens over too long a time or too often, irreversible reactions will occur leading to permanent damage, particularly in Li-ion cells. The permanent increase of cell temperature by overcharg- ing leads to increasing cell pressure, which means that uncontrolled overcharging can cause bursting or even explosion of a cell, releasing dangerous chemicals or even causing open fires [4.2.8].

What happens in fact is that repeated shallow charges cause crystalline changes in the cell electrodes which increase the internal resistance of the cell. ",True,3
What negative effect does high temperature and slow charging have on battery capacity?,"This is why, during charge as well as during discharge, the permitted voltage limits are reached much earlier, thus reducing battery capacity. Long, slow charging phases like “trickle charge” and increased operating tem- peratures support this undesirable behavior [4.2.8]. Periodic reconditioning of nickel-based battery cells allows recovery of the capacity lost by the memory effect. It would be even better, if possible, to cycle the battery, after having experienced a few hundred cycles at low DOD, for some 10 cycles with higher charge and discharge energy.. ",True,3
What method can potentially restore the full capacity of cells through controlled discharge?,"Reconditioning and Capacity RestorationIt is often possible to restore the full capacity by one or even several deep discharges with a low and con- trolled current down to a cell voltage of 1V [4.2.8].

What potential issue arises from a weak cell in a series battery connection during charging?,"Ina series connection of battery cells such effects would drive the “weak” cell with reduced capacity to reach the end-of-charge voltage prematurely, while the other cells with nominal characteristics would not yet have reached the completely charged state. If the charge status of the weak cell is ignored and more charge energy is applied, the weak cell will be over- charged and possibly damaged [4.2.8]. ",True,3
What happens to the nominal capacitance of the battery if the charging ends at the end-of-charge voltage?,"If the charge process is ended once the weak cell has reached its end-of-charge voltage, which by all means would be the correct charge process, then the battery’s nominal capacitance would not be reached; however, individual cells would not be stressed excessively..

Since the accuracy of an FE analysis increases with the number of ele- ments, namely the detail of the element network, an FE model generally uses some hundreds to thousands of nodes in order to obtain adequate results.

",True,3
What type of particles are used in the insulation material described?,"The insulation is based on a powder-like, highly dispersed silica with particles having only point contact and additionally separated by a hardening agent (Figure 4.3.19). Consequently, solid body ther- mal conduction is very much reduced [4.3.13].

What factors contribute to observed temperature differences in heat pipes during operation?,"Heat pipes operate fully passively and without energy supply from outside. Because evaporation and condensation take place at about the same tem- perature, heat can be transported with very small temperature differences.

What occurs when the pressure losses exceed the capillary gain in a heat pipe?,"and, accordingly, the pressure losses. The heat pipe fails when the flow discontinues; that is, when the pressure losses in the flowing fluid become larger than the pressure gain due to capillarity. Common capillary structures include open axial grooves or a combina- tion of several metallic screens (Figure 4.3.26) which are attached to the inner wall of the heat pipe.",True,3
What temperature range do heat pipes using aluminum and ammonia function effectively?,"Axial grooves are advantageous since they can be machined with high reproducibility directly into the profile by an extrusion process. From known heat pipe materials, only some soft aluminum alloys are suitable for extrusion of axial grooved profiles. Aluminum, a commonly used lightweight structural material, is compatible with ammonia (Table 4.3.5). Heat pipes with this material combination operate in the temperature range of about —40 to +80°C and combined with axial grooves they are the most com- mon type of heat pipes in space projects.

What conflicting requirements must capillary structures in heat pipes satisfy for effective design?,"The above-described heat pipes incorporate cap- illary structures along the full length of the profile, which must meet contradicting requirements. On the one hand, the dimensions which are effective for capillary action (pores, groove width) must be small to produce high capillary forces. On the other hand, these dense structures produce large pressure losses in the fluid flow. In practice an optimum has to be found during the heat pipe design phase. ",True,4
What is the effect of capillary force on operational procedures in spacecraft testing?,"However, the resulting capillary force is in most cases very small and operation against the Earth’s gravity is not possible.

What is the function of the capillary structure in a loop heat pipe during heat input?,"The so-called loop heat pipe (LHP) avoids these constraints. According to Figure 4.3.30, the capillary structure in these units is located only in the evapora- tor. Under heat input in the evaporator the generated vapor flows in a smooth, small tube to the condenser, condenses there and returns as liquid in a second tube toa reservoir which is an integral part of the evapora- tor. Because the capillary structure is locally restricted to the evaporator, it is possible to apply very small pore sizes with high capillarity without producing undue high-pressure losses in the loop.

What component allows the valve to operate against an adjustable control pressure?,"The valve (Figure 4.3.33) operates via an inte- grated spring bellows against a control pressure which can be adjusted to meet the control temperature se- lected at the evaporator. An increase of the evaporator temperature above a preselected control value causes a corresponding increase of the vapor saturation pres- sure and in turn a movement of the valve stem to open the valve outlet for an increased vapor supply to the ra- diator.

What percentage of a satellite's launch mass is typically allocated for propellant?,"As an average value, about 65% of the complete satellite mass at launch is stored propellant. The remaining 35% is used for the different satellite sub- systems and the payload, while 5 to 6% is required for the propulsion system hardware.

What total launch mass is required for a satellite to achieve a delta-v of 2360 m/s using a bipropellant system?,"The above considerations do not mean that a bipro- pellant propulsion system could not provide a “delta- v” of 2360 m/s, such as for a heavy communications satellite. But in such a case the total launch mass of the satellite would amount to 2400 to 2500 kg.",True,3
What factors influence the determination of the minimum impulse bit in attitude control?,"Ina number of cases attitude control requires very small impulse bits to perform propellant-efficient corrections around a satellite axis. This minimum impulse bit is determined by the thrust level and the minimum firing duration of the thruster. Cold gas and monopropellant thrusters have a clear advan- tage because of the low thrust levels they are able to generate.

",True,4
What types of thrusters should be positioned to minimize contamination for satellites with special requirements?,"For science satellites with special requirements or chemical purity, cold gas systems are preferred or attitude control because contamination of optical instruments or sensors by catalyst particles or unburnt propellant cannot be fully excluded for monopropel- ant or bipropellant thrusters. Should monopropellant or bipropellant thrusters be mandatory because of the needed velocity increment, the thrusters have to be positioned such that contamination can be minimized or even excluded..

What materials were utilized as catalysts for decomposing hydrogen peroxide in monopropellant applications?,"Hydrogen peroxide (H,O,) — in high concentration also known as HTP (High Test Peroxide) — was used in the early 1960s as a monopropellant. Structures made of silver or platinum were used as a catalyst, decomposing H,O, into water and oxygen in an exo- thermic process. The fundamental problem with such propulsion systems was the inadequate storability of H,O, for a long period of time.

What was developed in response to the detection of hydrogen cyanides during the Viking missions?,"For the two US Viking Mars missions in 1975 a modified hydrazine quality was developed. During tests with the braking engine of the descent stage, hydrogen cyanides were detected, which could have killed any traces of life to be detected during the lan- ding phase. These gases were created by the pyrolysis of aniline in the standard or monopropellant grade hydrazine. Therefore a drastic reduction of the aniline, iron, water and carbon content led to the “high-purity grade” of hydrazine. The reduction of aniline had a further positive effect by largely improving the cold start capability of the thrusters.. ",True,2
What are the selected fuels and oxidizers in the discussed propulsion systems?,"The search for propulsion systems of higher perfor- mance was necessitated by satellites with increasingly higher launch masses. Compared to monopropellant hydrazine, bipropellant propulsion systems further reduced the propellant mass by about 25%.

What element was primarily used for electric propulsion thrusters between 1960 and 1990 due to its desirable properties?,"Thrusters for electric propulsion require pro- pellants which can be easily evaporated and ionized and which have a high molecular weight. Therefore in the years 1960 to 1990 mercury was the first choice fulfilling most of the above criteria, but it had to be dropped because of its toxicity. Thus the development of thrusters for electric propulsion concentrated on the use of the colorless and odorless inert gas xenon, which can be stored in high-pressure gas tanks.

What is the pressure range to which gas is typically reduced for cold gas thrusters?,"In cold gas systems, the gas is stored in high- pressure tanks at about 300 bar and is reduced by a pressure regulator downstream of the tank to reduce the pressure to the operating pressure of the cold gas thrusters, normally in the order of 1 to 5 bar.",True,2
What is the mechanism used for propellant feeding in monopropellant or bipropellant systems?,"Unlike in cold gas systems, in monopropellant or bipropellant systems the propellant has to be actively fed from the tank(s) to the thrusters. In general, two different principles are applied:e Expulsion in the blow-down mode (thereby re- ducing pressure) e Expulsion at constant pressure.4.4.4.1 Blow-Down Mode",True,3
What is the term used for the mode that continuously lowers pressure in propulsion systems?,"Expulsion that continuously reduces pressure is known as the blow-down mode.

What pressure level is associated with the onset of a mission for hydrazine propulsion systems?,At the beginning of the mission (BOL) the pressu- re in the tank corresponds to the maximum operat- ing pressure of the thrusters; for hydrazine thrusters2/24/09 3:41:51 PM CHO04.indd Sec1:308,True,2
What is the minimum operating pressure for hydrazine thrusters at the end of a mission?,"about 22 to 30 bar. Propellant is expelled from the tank as soon as one or more thrusters are operated and the pressure in the tank decreases according to the amount of propellant consumed. Corresponding to the decreasing tank pressure, the engine thrust decreases as well. At the end of the mission (EOL) the remaining pressure in the tank should correspond to the minimum operating pressure of the thrusters; for hydrazine thrusters this is in the order of 5.0 bar. ",True,2
What is the required percentage of gas volume relative to total tank volume?,"To achieve this, the gas volume should amount to about 25% of the entire tank volume. The thrusters have to be capable of reliable and efficient operation over a pressure range of 4:1, the so-called blow-down ratio. During the development of the attitude control algo- rithms, the continuously changing thrust and impulse bit values have to be considered; thruster performance is of course well known from the relevant acceptance and qualification tests. ",True,2
What is the main limitation of blow-down systems when propellant demand is high?,"Blow-down systems are always reasonable when the propellant demand is not too high, otherwise the tank or tanks get too large or too many tanks would be required. A special case of the blow-down concept is a sys- tem with repressurization as in Figure 4.4.4 (right). It is advantageous in cases where, at a certain time in the mission, a higher thruster performance (thrust level) is required but is not available because the tank pressure and thus the thrust is reduced to levels not able to support this requirement. ",True,3
What factors must be considered when determining the repressurization timing and tank specifications for a propulsion system?,"Helium or nitrogen is stored in an additional tank, which is released at a certain time in the mission by opening a pyrotechnic valve. This leads to a pressure increase in the propellant tank, thereby increasing the thrust as well. The mission time for repressurization, and the volume and pressure of the additional tank, have to be determined such that during repressuriza- tion the maximum operating pressure of the propel- lant tank, the thrusters and all the other components of the propulsion system are not exceeded [4.4.1]..

What gases are typically used for pressurizing propellant tanks in a regulated propulsion system?,"In a pressure-regulated propulsion system the propellant tanks are pressurized with helium or in rare cases with nitrogen out of a separate pressurant tank via a pressure regulator. With this method, the pressure is kept at a constant value between BOL and EOL. This assures a constant propellant supply pressure up to the thrusters over the entire mission.

The remaining 5% is filled with pressurant gas to about 4 bar, sufficient to tolerate the maximum allowable pressure increase caused by temperature increases.",True,2
What is the nominal operating pressure that the propellant tanks are pressurized to after launch?,"After the launch, the propellant tanks are pressu- rized to the nominal operating pressure of about 17 bar. The pressure regulator has to keep the operating pressure constant over the entire mission. This is true for long-duration interplanetary missions but not for commercial communication satellites. The reason for this difference is explained in detail in Section 4.4.6.2.",True,1
What is the objective of pressure regulation in propulsion systems?,"The goal of pressure regulation is to maintain a constant thrust and constant impulse bits at identical firing conditions.

The tanks have only one port connecting the tubing system for loading the gas and its withdrawal during the mission. ",True,3
What materials currently replace Kevlar in the construction of composite tanks?,"In the past all- titanium tanks were produced from the heat-treated alloy Ti6Al4V. In the meantime so-called composite tanks have been more frequently used because of their significant weight advantage [4.4.12], [4.4.18], [4.4.19].

What operational benefits do diaphragm tanks provide regarding propellant management during launch?,"Diaphragm tanks (Figure 4.4.10) have several advantages. Since they can be qualified for up to 100 loading and unloading cycles, they can be easily tes- ted on the component level as well as on subsystem and system levels. They prevent propellant sloshing to a great extent and are capable of orienting the propellant even at high disturbance torques and ac- celerations. Regardless of whether the tank is filled to 40% or 90% or whether the propellant port is located against Earth’s gravity, the tank can be unloaded on the ground and can be launched in this configuration.

What issues are associated with tanks that use rubber diaphragm materials in propulsion systems?,"But disadvantages exist for tanks with rubber diaphragms. In particular, gas penetration and per- meability have to be mentioned. Helium penetrates the diaphragm material and dissolves in the propellant until helium saturation is achieved.

It can achieve an expulsion efficiency of about 97%. ",True,2
What limitation is associated with the reversal of a metallic diaphragm in propulsion systems?,One of the major disadvantages of the metallic diaphragm is the fact that the reversal can be performed just once. The consequence is that acceptance verification of a propulsion subsystem cannot include a diaphragm reversal. Launching with partially filled tanks can cause problems as well.. ,True,3
What propulsion system type offers efficiency improvements for larger satellites?,"As a competitive alternative for diaphragm tanks for applications involving monopropellant and bipro- pellant propulsion systems, surface tension tanks have been developed [4.4.13], [4.4.15], [4.4.16], [4.4.17], [4.4.18].

What is the threshold duration required to activate or deactivate thrusters for effective thrust production?,"Switching thrusters on or off requires a certain duration that results in a minimum thrust effect, the so-called impulse bit.

What potential issue could arise from the constant alternation of thruster activation in satellites?,"Continuous operation at high control accuracy (without leaving a “dead band” around the target) would require permanent alternation between “ne- gative” and “positive” thruster activation.

What is the flow of mass for thrusters at nominal thrust for attitude control?,"Thrusters cause primary forces.

How does a magnetic torquer interact with the Earth's magnetic field?,"A magnetic torquer (also referred to as a “torque rod”) generates a strong magnetic dipole that interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field. Thus the torquer is subject to an external torque, like a compass needle.",True,2
What materials are commonly used for the core in stronger dipole designs?,"The dipole can be generated by a simple coil (of copper or aluminum); its strength is proportional to the area which is enclosed by the electric current and to the current itself. Mass-effective designs can be made in this simple way up to dipoles of 10 Am’. To generate stronger dipoles, the coil is wrapped around a core material, typically a rod of soft iron that amplifies the magnetic flux inside the coil.

What type of orbits allow magnetic torquers to manage all torque directions effectively due to changing magnetic field orientation?,"Applications Magnetic torquers generate quite weak external tor- ques only in a plane perpendicular to the Earth’s ma- gnetic field vector. In polar orbits, where the Earth’s magnetic field changes its orientation continually, all torque directions can be generated within a reasonable period of time with a set of magnetic torquers poin- ting in different directions.

What system is responsible for detecting faults and switching modes in satellites?,"It is common for the main functions of the satellite, particularly the processes of the ACS, to be regularly checked by a software module which detects critical states and automatically switches over to alternative modes or to redundant hardware. The module goes by the name of fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Its autonomous functions may essentially affect the attitude control and have to be verified carefully at the system level as well.. ",True,3
What terms describe the phenomena where satellite subsystems interfere with each other electrically or magnetically?,"Furthermore, the ACS elements may interfere magnetically or electrically with other satellite sub- systems or even with each other (e.g., torque rod activation may disturb magnetometer measure- ments).

What is the purpose of creating a verification simulator separate from on-board data handling control software?,"An important aspect for verification is the separate development of on-board data handling (OBDH) control software and the “verification simulator”. Such a verification simulator can be suitably developed by another company ora separated in-house department. Strict separation of both developments reduces the risk of double errors (e.g., in axis polarity, scaling, etc.) which are critical but compensate each other in the test setup and thus would not become visible during verification..

What is a requirement for end-to-end verification of the fully integrated automatic control system on an air bearing test setup?,4.5.8.4 Air Bearing Test BedEven more realistic than HILT is end-to-end verifi- cation of the completely integrated ACS on an air bearing test bed. But this is subject to restrictions:,True,3
What types of sensors cannot have their environmental conditions fully replicated in testing?,"1. For sensors such as star trackers or Earth sensors, the environmental conditions of space and their dependence on the current attitude cannot be duplicated; for magnetometer or Sun sensors they can only be approached. Attitude propagation using gyros is possible without restriction. Thus the closed attitude control loop can only partially be tested with original sensors.",True,5
What factors limit the angular corridor for authentic testing of attitude control in test beds?,"2. Disturbance torques, present in space, are in the range of a few millinewton meters (for small satel- lites, 100 U Nm). Test beds are subject to higher disturbances, even if they are ideally suspended. Hence an attitude control using weak actuators can be verified only qualitatively. Furthermore, the center of gravity of the elastic test bed table moves slightly under the influence of gravity, which limits the angular corridor for authentic testing. Geometry also restricts it..

What is the typical location of the center of gravity in spacecraft design?,"3. Spacecraft rotation axes go through the center of gravity, which is normally located inside the ori- ginal satellite shape.

What is the primary function of sensors on a spacecraft?,"Basically (almost) every spacecraft serves “only” as a data capture and information collection center for the world. In this sense a spacecraft is nothing more than a data processing machine. Data is registered by the sensors, processed by the on-board computers, stored, and then transmitted by telemetry to the ground. Hence, data management is the central element of a spacecraft. The data management segment controls all other devices and collects the provided data. Informa- tion is extracted from this data and then transmitted to the ground.. ",True,3
What are the two primary functions of the data management segments on a spacecraft?,"In principle there are two different data mana- gement segments on-board with two different func- tions (see Figure 4.6.1). The first segment’s task is control and surveillance, traditionally executed by the on-board computer, which controls the spacecraft so that it survives and fulfills its mission.

Identify the three factors that contribute to the dependability of a data management system.,"e Reliability: This property is extremely important for the data management system and is the main cause for its high expense in comparison to ter- restrially embedded systems (see Section 4.6.4.). Three factors determine reliability: robustness, self- healing (self-regeneration) and fault tolerance.",True,3
What factors should be considered in spacecraft design regarding failure management for long-duration missions?,"e Self-healing (self-regeneration): The spacecraft must be able to handle and treat failures and anomalies by reconfiguration using redundant resources (reserves and spares). This is especial- ly important for missions with long lifetimes, for example 15 years. In these cases, simple self- healing using cheap components is not enough. Here we rather need very robust components. This originates a trade-off: how much to invest in robustness to avoid failures, and how much to invest in redundancy to compensate for failures?. ",True,4
What is a crucial requirement for safety-critical systems like railway and aircraft transportation?,"e Fault Tolerance: Even if components are not permanently damaged, malfunctions are to be expected at any time. The system must be able to recognize such anomalies, to compensate and to correct them, favorably, before they have unex- pected consequences. On Earth we find similar requirements (and even stricter ones) in the case of safety-critical systems, such as for railway and aircraft transportation systems or for nuclear reactor control. ",True,2
What is the approximate thickness of the protective atmospheric layer against cosmic radiation on Earth?,"Nevertheless, on the ground we are well protected by an approximately 50km thick atmospheric layer against cosmic radiation; a spacecraft is, however, not protected.

What frequency increase in data corruption is observed in space compared to terrestrial systems?,"electronic components. Exactly as with terrestrial safety-critical systems, data corruption must be treated. However, its frequency is higher in space by approximately a factor of 10 up to 1000; 1 to 10 bit flips per day can be expected to occur in the on-board computer memory (e.g. 16 Mbytes). Very Limited Space, Energy (Power) and Dim- ension Resources: As with hand-held devices (cellular phones, portable navigation systems, MP3 players, organizers, cameras) the system has to use those resources very economically. Solutions for such Earth products can be of interest also for space missions if they are able to survive space conditions.. ",True,4
What is the temperature range that automotive electronics must operate within?,"Cold/Heat: Although the spacecraft is exposed to extreme temperatures, from —170 to +120°C, the temperature range of the data management seg- ment is relatively harmless. The data management segment is rather well protected in the middle of the spacecraft. The temperature mostly stays between +10 and +40°C, which produces no dif- ficulties for the electronics. With some terrestrial applications the requirements are more extreme: for instance, automotive electronics must be able to work from —40 (winter nights) to +80° C (direct Sun in summer).. ",True,3
How does the absence of air in space affect heat dissipation for electronics?,"Vacuum: For electronics on the ground, we can use air (even ventilators) to conduct heat away from the heat source. In space, in vacuum, it is not so simple to conduct heat away. This can lead to a heat concentration and a very irregular temperature distribution in the electronic components. Metal heat conductors must be used to transport heat from the electronic boards to the main spacecraft structure.. ",True,3
What risks do loose metal components pose in environments with no gravitational force or strong vibrations?,"No Gravity: This should be no problem for the electronics and the software, but a loose, small metal part (e.g., a cut-off piece of wire) could freely move around and cause short circuits at different places.

What type of shockwave occurs at separation with a force of up to 1000g?,"Earth’s gravitational acceleration (g). At separation there is a shockwave of a few microseconds at up to 1000g. This requires especially robust hardware. Software Complexity: As in all other information technology areas, software complexity increases rapidly. It has now reached dimensions which are barely controllable. With today's complexity one must use proven software engineering methodo- logy and a strict quality assurance program. ",True,2
What percentage of total software development costs typically accounts for software quality assurance?,"The expenses for software quality assurance are often underestimated; they amount to between 50 and 80% of the complete software development cost. Software Uploads: Software efforts are almost always underestimated. Hence, some missions start before the software is ready. This is not a good concept and carries many dangers in itself. Never- theless, it is important to create the capability of reloading new software or software updates. ",True,2
What is a reason for the necessity of software uploads in spacecraft during a mission?,This functionality is also usually provided for mobile consumer electronics and navigation systems. Software uploads are necessary because it is not possible to foresee all possible situations on-board the spacecraft. During the mission improvements are necessary or errors might be recognized and new software must be installed on-board the spacecraft. Another reason is that in the course of the mission components could be permanently damaged or change their working properties. ,True,2
What is the reason for not developing software that anticipates all possible failures?,"It is conceivable to have software which foresees all these situations, but the complexity of such a system would be too high. Therefore it is usual to wait until a failure or unexpected situation is discovered before updating the software. Remote Diagnosis: It is not always the case that the software can recognize and identify all possible anomalies. Hence, a remote diagnosis capability is required so that the developers can diagnose the system from the ground. ",True,3
What is the purpose of collecting state information from subsystems in large terrestrial machines?,"The software must be able to collect state information on all subsystems and transmit it to the ground. This functionality is also used for large terrestrial machines (newspaper printers, excavators, mining machinery, packing machines, etc.). These machines are distributed worldwide, but maintenance engineers cannot be everywhere — they have to diagnose errors from remote offices.. ",True,2
What are the key challenges in achieving high computational performance in spacecraft compared to terrestrial devices?,"e High Computing Performance: Usually the computing performance in spacecraft is slower than comparable devices on the ground by a factor of 10 to 100. The demanded high reliability and limited resources exclude high computing per- formance. Today, space applications are always in need of more computing power. New ways must be found to combine high computing performance with high reliability and limited resources (and not just for space applications).. ",True,4
What challenge is unique to data processing systems in space compared to terrestrial systems?,"These requirements are not new and they are also not so different from the ones valid for terrestrial applications.

What is the primary concern when a satellite detects a fire on Earth?,"In the simplest case it suffices if the data management collects, saves and later transmits the data to the Earth. However, in many cases we do not need the raw data, but only the information contained in it. For example, a satellite which should find a fire on the ground can take an optical image with 10 megapixels (30 Mbytes). However, we are only interested in knowing where the fire is located.

What is the ratio of data reduction mentioned in the text?,"This could be coded, say, in 1 kbyte. This is a data reduction of 30000 to 1. Today all satellites transmit daily more than 10'* bytes to the ground. This is a huge amount, of data; however, of that, we need at most 10° bytes of information. Nevertheless, data reduction is very difficult and computationally intensive. Usually we receive almost raw data and extensive computations are necessary to extract the required information in computer centers on the ground, often with human help.. ",True,2
What distinguishes information from data in terms of purpose and intent?,"Here it becomes clear that information must have a purpose, in contrast to data. Only for a certain purpose or with a defined intention can one extract informa- tion from data. However, from the same data one can extract different information for different purposes.2/24/09 3:43:38 PM CHO04.indd Sec1:364",True,2
What are the implications of reducing data amounts for storage and transmission in terms of computing needs?,"The trend is to reduce the amounts of data to be stored and transmitted. This requires higher computing performance and smarter algorithms. The target is to save and transmit only the required information, and not the complete raw data. We can see this effect espe- cially in hyperspectral and SAR (radar) images. These applications generate several gigabytes (10°) or even terabytes (10!”) of data per second. ",True,3
What is the reason for performing data processing on the spacecraft instead of transmitting raw data?,To save and trans- mit the raw data would be a huge waste of resources. Hence the data processing and information extraction have to be done on-board of the spacecraft.. ,True,2
What is the main purpose of increasing autonomy in spacecraft control systems?,On the control system side the trend is to imple- ment higher autonomy on-board the spacecraft so that operational expenses on the ground can be reduced. The spacecraft should be able to execute autonomously all actions to fulfill its mission over long time periods.,True,3
What capability is essential for satellites to operate independently during deep-space missions?,"Today, some satellites can already plan their activi- ties for the coming hours or days autonomously. This is of special importance for deep-space missions where human intervention is very difficult. An autonomous mission which is able to operate independently for several days must have high computing performance to be able to plan and reduce the accumulated data to (a few) required information bytes..

These operations are very simple; it is just a matter of registering the signals and storing them.",True,3
What is the required sampling frequency for servo control activities in the specified layer?,"The next layer with a frequency range around 1kHz contains steering or servo control activities. The sensor data is filtered to reduce the noise, then a certain position, force or speed is held constant. Deviations must be compensated rapidly. Often the servo control is executed on a dedicated simple pro- cessing unit which is attached directly to the actuator (in this example, in every joint). These operations are more complicated than the ones described above, but they require a sampling frequency of only 1 kHz and not 5 kHz.. ",True,3
What range of frequency is used for executing control activities in a system?,"The next layer contains the control activities. The task is to determine the desired attitude, namely, desired position, desired force or desired speed, which should be maintained as predefined. These operations are more complicated; however, they may be executed with a lower frequency: between 100 and 2 times per second. In the example of the robot arm, this layer must coordinate all joints to reach a certain target or move in a desired trajectory. ",True,2
How does a spacecraft maintain its orientation using reaction wheels?,"Another example is the attitude control of a satellite or spacecraft, where this layer must control, for example, three or four reaction wheels in such a way that a certain attitude is held or. ",True,3

The control must evaluate data from several sensors and thus control several actuators.,True,3
What must be considered when scheduling activities involving satellite operations during a time period?,"The next layer is the planning or autonomy acti- vities. This activity comprises the planning of what activities must be performed during the next time period respecting predefined constraints; for exam- ple, the satellite should point its solar cells to the Sun, charge batteries and, when it flies over a certain goal, take and store images, then wait until it has a ground contact and transmit the images to the ground station. ",True,3
What considerations must be taken into account for autonomous planning in this system?,"This could be a plan to be autonomously executed. Selecting the target coordinates for taking images could likewise be a job for the autonomy module. In this case the planning component must “know” the purpose of the mission and which constraints have to be kept. For example, the spacecraft should scan the complete Earth, excluding the oceans, but the battery charge may never fall below a certain value; in particular, the battery must be fully charged before entry into the shadow of the Earth. ",True,4
What is the current trend regarding planning execution in operations?,"Today, operations on this layer are mostly executed by people; however, the trend is to execute the planning on-board automatically. The planning is a very complicated task, but it requires a lower frequency, in the range of minutes or hours.. ",True,2
What are the advantages and disadvantages of central processing compared to distributed processing in data management?,Trend 2: Central versus Distributed Processing,True,4
What challenges arise from having multiple control computers in spacecraft and automotive industries?,"Traditionally, many components produced by the spacecraft industry (likewise by car manufacturers) have their own control computer. As a consequence, the space segment contains many computers from many different manufacturers. The car industry has the same problem and tries to counteract this trend because the associated complexity is no longer con- trollable and the system becomes unreliable. There are many initiatives against this trend, and almost all automobile producers support one or more of them. ",True,3
How does the shift from dedicated control computers to a uniform software environment impact scalability in aerospace applications?,"As an example, AUTOSAR tries to create a uniform software environment. The aim is that the control of any device should be able to run and be executed on any computer in the car, and not just on a dedicated computer for the particular device. This trend already casts its shadow over the aerospace industry, in parti- cular for micro-, pico- and nanosatellites, because the usual approach where “every device has its own con- trol computer” can no longer be scaled down.

What challenges do pico- and nanosatellites face regarding size and weight constraints?,"chips are already very small and economical, but this is still not sufficient for pico- and nanosatellites, where the available space, the allowed weight and the energy are very limited.",True,3
What approach should be abandoned due to inefficiency in resource management on spacecraft?,"For very limited resources one must abandon the approach where “every device has its own controller,” because it is not efficient. Resource sharing with intelligent software for resource management has to be implemented. The same hardware platform must be used for the control of many devices and for the execution of applications on the spacecraft bus as well as on the payload side. For example, on the main bus: telemetry, attitude control, navigation, power control, etc. ",True,3
What types of tasks can be performed by the payload on a single computer?,"For the payload we could have pattern recognition, image processing, classifications, etc. All these func- tions can be executed on one single computer.. ",True,2
What is one advantage of using distributed functionality in spacecraft systems?,"For more complex spacecraft, different approaches are followed today. Some try to distribute the complete functionality to different processors, while others try to create a powerful central computer. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. With distributed functionality a failure will not immobilize the complete satellite, unless it concerns a vital function.",True,3
What is recommended for crucial functionalities to prevent interference with additional features?,"Another trend is to separate vital functions from extra (nice-to-have) functions. Vital functions (critical) are more difficult to be implemented and certified. Therefore, they should run totally independently of the nice-to-have functions. Preferably they should run on different processors to avoid any kind of interference. Another extreme is “a very critical function shall have its own processor.” Some try to achieve the same goal by implementing several software virtual processors on a single processor (time-space partitioning).. ",True,3
What role does a centralized approach play in managing computing resources for devices and applications?,With a centralized approach the on-board compu- ter can bea processor pool which provides dependable storage and computing performance for all devices and applications. A network of (software) tasks can be distributed in this processor pool. Tasks replace traditional processors for each and every device. One could say that the tasks implement virtual processors for all devices. Payload tasks and other applications are likewise executed. ,True,3
What system feature ensures continued operation despite individual computer failures?,"This critical computer must be very dependable; redundancy features must exist. The computer pool must consist of several redundant inde- pendent computers. Even if some fail, those remaining should be able to fulfill the mission.. ",True,3

What trend is observed across various technological fields regarding functionality implementation?,"Not only in spacecraft, but in all technological areas there is a clear trend to move as much functionality as possible into software [4.6.1]. Figure 4.6.3 shows the rise and decline of control technologies, first implemented by means of mechanical parts, then going to more electronic (analog) components, and now toward software. The graphics refer only to the control and not to the function. It is not practical to replace the tires of a car with software; however, the complete motor control can be implemented with software.. ",True,2
What has replaced mechanical controls in modern systems?,"Mechanical controls have been replaced by electro- nic controls, for example analog technology. Electronic controls are being replaced by software controls.

What kind of operations include basic mathematical processes and decision-making functions?,"4 to logical and arithmetic operations, storage and data transmission (networks).",True,4
What type of programming is used to configure the connections between logical operators in FPGAs?,"Besides the traditional sequential software which is executed on a CPU, the next variant is emerging: FPGA programming (Free Programmable Gate Array programming). FPGAs are chips that provide millions of unconnected elementary logical operators (AND, OR, XOR, register). These operators are inter- connected by programming. A complex functionality can be implemented by interconnecting such simple logical operators. The connections are configured not by hand but by a compiler for a special programming. ",True,3

Then this program is translated (synthesized) to FPGA connections.",True,3
What advantages does software offer in space applications compared to hardware?,"The shifting of functionality toward software is extremely interesting in space applications, because software has no mass, needs no space, uses no power and can be reloaded from the ground. But the intro- duction of software often presents more difficulties than expected. In many (small) space projects there are barely any software engineers; hence, the complexity of software development is underestimated, almost without exception. ",True,3
What are the typical impacts of neglecting software planning during project initiation?,As a consequence the software is neglected at the beginning of project planning and toward the end the project is always on the critical path. This usually causes substantial schedule delays and higher costs.. ,True,3

What term describes the arrangement of interconnected computers and devices in a data management system?,"In general the data management system consists of several communicating computers which are connected to several input and output devices. The interconnection structure is called topology and there are countless variations of such structures. Very simple devices without their own processor must be connected directly to a computer, perhaps using an analog/digital converter, or relays.

Figure 4.6.4 shows some possibilities to connect devices to on-board computers.,True,2
What is a significant drawback of utilizing a star configuration in network design?,"With the star topology every device has its private connection to/from the on-board computer. This makes communication easier and safer, because the failure of a device has no effect on the communication with the other devices. The disadvantage is the large number of connections required.",True,2
What is a potential drawback of a bus topology in terms of device failure?,"Abus topology (e.g., CAN bus) is more economical, it needs only one connection to/from the on-board computer for many devices, and the number of lines is minimal. The disadvantage is that the failure of one device could block the entire communication exchange in the system. Hence, the bus has to be redundant. Furthermore, it should be possible to separate defec- tive devices from the bus in case of failure. ",True,3
What is required for all devices in a network regarding communication protocols and speeds?,Another disadvantage is that all devices must have the same communication protocol (and the same speed). There are many standardized buses which are supported by. ,True,3

Within embedded systems the CAN bus (originally from the automotive industries) is used very often.However, the world is not black and white; mixtures of both topologies are mostly used.",True,3
What type of hierarchy exists between computers and devices in a fault-tolerant system?,"For fault tolerance reasons the on-board computer consists mostly of several identical computers communicating with each other. The interconnec- tion structure between communicating computers is based on a different principle than the interconnection between computers and devices. Here a master-slave hierarchy exists. The computer (master) controls and the device (slave) reacts accordingly. Within the interconnection structure for computers, all nodes (computers) are equal partners. ",True,3

The hardware functionality is limited to logical/arithmetic opera- tions, storage and data/signal transmission (networks), and these are precisely the modules one finds in the hardware design..

What are the four primary systems that form the essential components of a spacecraft?,4 Subsystems of Spacecraft,True,3
What flexibility do FPGAs provide regarding pin functions and internal operations?,"because the variability of interfaces is huge and available components offer almost exactly all required interfaces. With FPGAs it is possible to freely define the function of every single pin and the internal func- tionality; it is also possible to program the complete I/O and network structure in one single chip, else one would need many chips and a large physical interface board (see Figure 4.6.7).. ",True,4
What types of operations are particularly suitable for implementation in FPGAs due to their repetitive nature?,"Besides the I/O functionality, it is common to shift filter and (pipeline) data processing into FPGAs. Operations which are executed repeatedly for a data stream are predestined for FPGA implementation.",True,3
What is the concept of integrating an entire computer onto a single chip called?,"Nowadays, FPGAs are so big that complete CPUs can be implemented inside them. Some manufacturers offer the possibility to synthesize different CPUs [4.6.3], [4.6.4], while others integrate up to four fixed CPUs into the FPGA chip [4.6.2]. It thereby becomes possible to think about SOC (System on One Chip). The target is to integrate the complete computer into a single chip. Figure 4.6.8 shows two approaches toward SOC.. ",True,2
What is a common requirement when utilizing FPGAs for complete logic implementation?,"FPGAs can implement almost the complete logic of the computer, but their storage possibilities are relatively limited. With an FPGA solution one must almost always attach external memory chips. Then one can no longer speak of a “system on one chip,” but of a “system on very few chips.” Alternatively, there are different manufacturers [4.6.8] which integrate CPU, flash (ROM), RAM, a network connection, different standardized I/O buses, and output signals in one single chip.

What are some challenges associated with shielding embedded systems from radiation in space applications?,"So far we have made no difference between “normal” embedded systems and on-board computers for space missions. Extra precautions against radiation effects must be implemented for space applications. The easiest solution would be to block the radiation, for instance with a thick box of lead. However, this is not practicable because of the huge mass and the space requirements for the box. In addition, some radiation particles (ions) carrying very high energy. ",True,3

What types of damage can miniaturized circuits experience from cosmic radiation?,"Cosmic radiation consists of protons, alpha particles, heavy ions, electrons and neutrons. In miniaturized circuits three kinds of damage can be caused by these particles [4.6.9]: totally ionizing dose (TID) damage, single event upset (SEU) and single event latchup (SEL).",True,3

What is the unit of measurement for radiation absorbed dose mentioned in the context?,"noise therefore rise slowly but continuously, until the signal-to-noise ratio is so bad that the signal can no longer be clearly distinguished from the noise. If this occurs the component has failed permanently. The TID is measured (even today) in krad (kilorads of radiation absorbed dose, or the energy dose). The radiation intensity depends on the orbit. For low Earth orbits (below 800km) one can assume 3 to 10 krad per year if protection is provided by a2mm aluminum shield. ",True,2
What is the maximum radiation dose that normal electronic components can withstand?,"Normal electronic components survive approximately 30krad and space-certified components (radiation hardened) are designed for a dose of 300 krad. For comparison, | krad is deadly for humans.. ",True,2
What are the potential consequences of a single event upset in memory cells?,"As mentioned, SEU and SEL are both single event effects (SEEs). They are caused by single high-energy particles impacting or penetrating the semiconductor material. The adjacent material absorbs the energy and an ionization track is created. If this happens within a flip-flop switch or a memory cell, a change of state might occur (from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1). This causes a data corruption by SEU. SEUs cause only data damage; the component itself will not be damaged. ",True,3
What is the recommended daily threshold of SEUs to anticipate for data safety?,"One must expect 10 SEUs per day. To prevent this data damage, one has to implement some kind of redundancy code or create redundant data.. ",True,2

What is the maximum time allowed to switch off a device to prevent burning the chip surface?,"current such that the chip surface is burnt. SELs are rare; several years can pass before one appears. To avoid damage, the circuit has to be interrupted im- mediately. In less than 1 ms the device (power) has to be switched off.",True,3
What is the suggested method to protect circuits from SEL after its detection?,"Figure 4.6.9 gives a summary of measures for designing safe space computers. The only possible precautions against TID are to screen the parts used and to select robust hardware components. Data redundancy helps in recognizing corrupted data and correcting it as a measure to counteract SEUs. As protection against SEL, the complete circuit must be switched off within a millisecond after detection of the occurrence. A couple of seconds later it can be switched on again.. ",True,3
What is a recommended method to identify power spikes in circuit components?,SEL can cause a sudden power spike which under certain circumstances might be only a little higher than the normal current. The latchup protection (current monitoring) must recognize such spikes and must switch off everything immediately. To be able to recognize the spike it is advisable to monitor all components separately.,True,3
What method can be used to ensure data integrity by recognizing and correcting corruption in memory?,Data in memory and in FPGA registers can be protected by redundancy. Redundant codes (EDC codes) allow data corruption to be recognized and 1 bit per entry (register) to be corrected. The simplest way to verify the correct execution of the logic is to replicate it two or three times on-board and compare all results.,True,2

What method does LEON-FT use to ensure reliability in processing operations?,"With standard CPUs one cannot expect such protective measures, hence ESA has developed the LEON-FT processor [4.6.12]. Inside LEON-FT every function and every register is replicated three times (TMR, Triple-Module Redundancy). After every operation all three results are compared; if one is different, it is immediately corrected. LEON-FT is safe, but slow. Another alternative is to use standard COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) processors and to build the required redundancy externally or by replication in software. ",True,3
What role do watchdogs play in monitoring function execution time?,"For example, two or three processors can gather their results and compare them. With the software one can execute every function two or three times and compare the results. It is more economical to check only results against plausibility rules. A very simple and economical measure is to use watchdogs; for every function a maximum allowable duration is defined. The watchdog has to be triggered within this time period, otherwise it will execute a reset of the computer. After this a recovery action has to take place.. ",True,3
Why is it challenging to evaluate software in the context of spacecraft subsystems?,"Software is only information and has no physical representation or properties. Because the subsystems of a spacecraft are measured according to their physi- cal properties (mass, space, power consumption, life expectations, imaging, etc.), it is very difficult to treat",True,3
What challenges arise from the lack of universally accepted metrics for evaluating software properties?,"software as a subsystem like all the others. In addition, there are no unequivocal metrics for software. Today there are approx. 400 metrics to measure the properties of software, but they are very controversial and are not generally accepted.",True,3
How does software complexity compare to mechanical components in space missions?,"All this makes software rather unfathomable. One only knows that software is immaterial, abstract, complex, everywhere, big, expensive and error prone.

How often does chip capacity double according to the discussed advancements in technology?,Progress in information technology is rapid: chip capacity doubles every 18 months and the systems can be made smaller.

The biggest challenge in software development is to reduce and control the complexity.",True,2
What challenge arises from the interdisciplinary collaboration in spacecraft software development?,"Besides complexity, the next big problem with software development is the required know-how of the developers. Spacecraft software contains the total knowledge of the complete mission. This is the combined knowledge of the involved computer scientists, electrical engineers, mathematicians, physi- cists, mechanical engineers and space engineers.

What percentage of software development costs is typically consumed by testing in critical software?,"Normally the testing of critical software consumes up to 80% of the software development costs. The testing of software functionality is the most difficult and time-consuming test for every space mission, because it contains the complete spacecraft behavior.

What is the main goal regarding the understanding of the BOSS implementation by developers?,"For every single component the question is asked whether it can be made simpler, while nobody is trying to make it more complex (or elegant).

What is the main purpose of the software responsible for data reduction and management in a payload system?,"Payload or mission science software is somehow dif- ferent from the bus control software which runs on the on-board computer. The function of the payload software is data reduction and data management. The payload software is supposed to extract information from the data provided by the sensors (e.g., cameras, radar and other sensors). These applications are mostly numerical computations or number-crunching tasks with a large amount of data. Some applications require on-the-fly data processing. This means that sensor data should be processed as soon as it is provided. ",True,3
What happens to data when its rate exceeds storage capacity?,"by the sensor, that is before the data is stored. This is the case when the data rate is too high for storage.

It controls the I/O devices using I/O drivers. Modern operating systems provide middleware which implements the communications between the appli- cations. Middleware helps make it possible for appli- cations to be developed and operated independently of each other. Without middleware the applications would have to communicate directly with each other, often by means of common variables. This method results in a strong dependence between applications, which makes the system more complex.. ",True,3
What is the primary function of user applications in spacecraft operations?,"The (user) applications run on top of the ope- rating system and middleware.

What action is taken when a significant deviation is identified by the monitoring system?,"6. Supervision Module (Surveillance): The surveil- lance module checks the current state of all vital subsystems and compares the relevant parame- ters with predefined limits which should not be exceeded during nominal operations.

What are the key characteristics of programming designed for immediate system response and task prioritization?,4.6.3.4 Real-Time Programming,True,3
What are the key components that determine the correctness of real-time tasks?,"Real time does not necessarily signify a quick reaction, but it means to guarantee a reaction inside a certain time window [4.6.7]. The correctness of real-time tasks not only consists of the generation of a correct output value, but also has to be generated at the right point in time and not simply “as fast as possible,” such as an alarm clock which should ring around 06:15: its correct output is not only “riiinnnnggg,” but “riinnnggg” around 06:15, it must not be exactly 06:15:00.000; there is a response time window with a certain tolerance, for example the ring would be satisfactory between 6:12 and 6:18. ",True,3
What are the consequences of jumping too early or too late in terms of timing?,"The end of the time window is the deadline (not later). In connec- tion with real-time definitions, only the deadlines are mentioned; the beginning of the time windows is often ignored. For example, if somebody wants to jump onto a train, it is bad to jump too late (behind the train), but even worse to jump too early (in front of the train)!. ",True,2
What does the term 'real time' indicate in applications without specifying speed?,"“Real time” says nothing about speed. Some applications have very long periods and other very short periods. For example, an alarm clock which must ring at a certain time every day would be a real-time application with a period of 24 hours. A charging system which should print invoices at the end every month and mail them is likewise a real-time applica- tion with a frequency of 12 times per year. ",True,2

"What is the typical frequency range for steering tasks, according to the provided information?","The periods and the limitations of the time require- ments are different for steering tasks and for control tasks (see Figure 4.6.2). The steering tasks have a relatively high frequency ranging from 100 Hz up to 30 kHz (30000 times per second) but are easy to calcu- late. In space applications a frequency of 1 kHz (within the servo control of the devices) is very common. The control tasks have relatively low frequencies, but are more complicated to calculate. ",True,3
What is the typical frequency range mentioned for certain applications?,"Their frequency might range between 1 Hz and 1000 Hz. In space applications a frequency of 2Hz is usual. Thermal checks, for example, can have in contrast a period of 30 seconds (temperature changes relatively slowly).. ",True,2
What defines the time constraints for periodic tasks in a control system?,Classification of Real-Time TasksTypically a control job is split into tasks running in parallel. Some of them can run periodically (cyclic) and others aperiodically. For periodic tasks the three phases mentioned above have to fit into a given time window.,True,3
What is the purpose of the initialization function in task management?,"The aperiodic tasks are activated as sporadic tasks by asynchronous external events (interrupts) or as spontaneous reactions to internal events. All tasks have an initialization function which is called up once at system start, and a “handle” function which is called up for every activation of the task. The ongoing tasks run in the background without time requirements.",True,3
What types of computations are performed when there are no time constraints?,They execute long-time computations which are not time constrained or check system states whenever the computer is in idle mode.,True,3
What are the consequences of failing to meet fixed deadlines in time-critical tasks?,"Time-critical or hard real-time tasks have fixed deadlines or response time windows which may not be missed. If the reaction does not take place in the intended response time windows, the system fails, causing unwanted effects: for example, not switching off the heat source of a boiler before it explodes. Switching off a millisecond after this hard deadline is of no help.",True,3
How is the response time window characterized for soft real-time tasks compared to time-critical tasks?,"For the soft real-time tasks or time-sensitive tasks the response time window is not defined as strictly as for the time-critical tasks. The response time window is to be interpreted rather as a desirable time. For ex- ample, turning on a heating system if the temperature goes below 19°C is not so time critical as the case of avoiding an explosion. If it takes place some seconds or even minutes later or earlier, it does not mean that the system has failed.. ",True,2
Define the two main components of dependability in spacecraft operations.,"Spacecraft anomalies and failures have to be expected.However, the spacecraft must continue its missiondespite anomalies.

What is the maximum allowable failure rate for control systems where failure can lead to catastrophic consequences?,"When a failure of the control system can have ca- tastrophic or life-threatening consequences the control system has to provide ultrahigh dependability: This means a maximum of 10° failures per hour may occur, or, in other words, a maximum of one failure in 10° hours of operation is allowed. This means only one failure in 114000 years of operation! Such ultra- high dependability cannot be guaranteed with today’s technology, but many control systems have to be (and are) certified according to this measure. ",True,3
What is the acceptable rate of failures per hour for human space missions?,"In the satellite business a failure has (normally) no life-threatening consequences, only loss of high investments. For such systems a dependability of “only” 10° to 10” failures per hour is tolerable. In contrast, human space missi- ons require a dependability of 10~° failures per hour.. ",True,2
What are the two recommended actions to enhance reliability in embedded control systems?,To achieve the highest possible dependability in embedded control systems and to avoid possible failures it is recommended to:1. Minimize the probability of malformations. 2. Recognize and handle anomalies while the system is running.To satisfy these two points the three approaches listedbelow should be followed [4.6.6]:,True,3
What is most likely the main reason for malfunctions and failures during design?,1. Search for the lowest possible complexity: make the design as simple as possible because the main cause of malfunctions and failures is high complexity.,True,2

How does redundancy management influence the design of systems during the development process?,"3. Optimize redundancy and redundancy manage- ment. It is possible to have reliable systems in spite of unreliable components. Redundancy alone does not enhance dependability; more important is redundancy management, which decisively influences the design of software and hardware from the beginning to the end of the development.",True,3
What does certification of a system as very reliable imply about its failure rate?,If a system has been certified as very reliable and safe it means only that very few failures can occur. Absolute reliability (a system which never fails) is not possible in technical systems. Always be aware of anomalies!,True,2
What are the primary sources of anomalies that can lead to undesirable results?,An error is the cause of undesirable results and can lie with people (operators) or machines.

What are the primary causes of mechanical errors leading to catastrophic consequences in a system?,"All components of a system are error prone. But not all components are endangered in the same way. Mechanical errors which can lead to catastrophic consequences are primarily caused by control errors. Most of them come from unpredictable situations. A second category of failures is caused by mistakes in the development (mostly in the software, because of its complexity). A third source for malfunctions is mechanical wear and tear as well as failures of elec- tronic components.. ",True,3
"How can errors be categorized based on their source, behavior, and category?",Errors can be classified as follows:e Source: development errors or runtime error e Behavior: permanent or sporadic errors e Category: value or time errors.,True,3
What is the primary role of a fault-tolerant system when faults or errors occur?,"A fault-tolerant system should fulfill its function even after the occurrence of faults, errors and internal failures. It may contain errors; however, it may not propagate them or make them visible. Any internal error, failure or disturbances must not show external effects.",True,3
What must a fault-tolerant system achieve after multiple failures to ensure safety?,"A safe system may interrupt/discontinue its func- tion, but it may not pose any danger. If a fault-tolerant system can no longer perform its function, say, after many failures, control of the system cannot simply be lost; the system must rather be configured to a safe, stable state and remain there until help can be provided.",True,4
What is the main difference in operation between master modules and slave modules in a system?,"Active modules, such as processors, are masters and can act independently. In contrast, slave modules (simple I/O devices, sensors, actuators) do not act independently; they only react to commands from master modules. Therefore, anomalies from active modules can spread faster in the system and cause further anomalies in other modules. An active module is able to disturb other modules by sending messages, bus accesses, entries in other memories, etc. The con- sequences of these anomalies are more dramatic when the modules also directly control the actuators..

What requirements must modules implement for internal error management?,"Module errors can be handled internally in each module; otherwise, errors will be visible outside the module (they have visible consequences) and must be handled externally.

What is a common method to detect if a microcontroller has become unresponsive?,"Normal microcontrollers have a high degree of inte- gration, but normally no support for internal error detection and handling. Coarse mistakes, for example if the processor gets stuck or goes astray, can be detec- ted by a watchdog logic. A counteraction could be to perform a module reset. For a more sophisticated supervision scheme one must duplicate (or even triplicate) the central processing unit (duplex central processing unit). ",True,2
What is the requirement for replicas in a system where CPUs need to perform simultaneously?,"In this case all replicas must perform the same function at the same time; therefore, the behavior of the CPUs can be compared externally.. ",True,2
What method can be used to manage transient internal CPU errors during software task execution?,"Transient internal CPU errors can be handled by executing every software task twice. If both executions produce the same results, it can be assumed that there was no error. If they differ, the same task can be exe- cuted a third time and compared again to identify the (probably) right result.",True,2
What technique is used in the LEON-FT CPU to ensure reliability in operations?,LEON-FT from the ESA CPU was developed especially for safety-critical systems. In LEON-FT every internal function is implemented three times (triplication) and the results are compared imme- diately after each basic operation. Deviations are corrected immediately.,True,3
What methods can be used for ensuring the integrity of memory and storage devices?,"Memory and storage errors are simpler to detect and correct. For securing memory and storage devices we can use simple parity, EDAC/EDC codes (Error Detection and Correction codes), CRC (Cyclic Redundant Code) at block level, multiple copies of the data, and address range protection registers (rather for software errors).",True,3
What are the primary functions of Error Detection and Correction codes in memory systems?,Bit flips in memories accumulate with time (new flips can occur at any time). In general EDAC can,True,3
What is the primary role of error detection in data handling?,"only correct one bit flip per word. If, however, two bit flips have accumulated in a single word, we can still detect the error, but (normally) we cannot correct it. Therefore, the complete memory should be exami- ned cyclically and every bit flip corrected as soon as possible, as long as it is possible.4.6.4.2 Module-External Handling by Using Redundant Modules",True,2
What is the primary challenge in comparing results from redundant modules in error handling?,"The most common and simplest method for exter- nal error handling is to replicate the modules as a whole and externally compare their results by using a supervisor [4.6.7]. The supervisor needs a reference to be able to recognize anomalies, for example for plausibility checks or for simply comparing the results of several redundant modules. But note especially that the problem of comparison is difficult, because small input differences can lead to absolutely diffe- rent results. ",True,2
What issue may arise when handling values close to decision thresholds in code?,"This happens with values near decision thresholds, for example heater() {temperature = readTemperature(); if (temperature > 19.5) {... } else { ... }}. ",True,3
How does a tolerance of 0.01% affect the comparability of results in parallel modules?,"With a value around 19.5 a sensor tolerance of only 0.01% can lead to huge differences, so that the results of two parallel running modules would no longer be comparable. To solve this problem, the voter/compa- rator needs more information: for example, whether a decision was near a threshold value. This makes the comparison of results much more difficult.",True,4
What is the role of the voter module in observing other modules?,"The voter can be implemented as a dedicated pas- sive module (hardware) observing the active modules. This increases the complexity of the system, which brings new risks. What will detect a malfunction of this new module (voter)? However, the voter module is much simpler than the active modules and therefore fewer errors can be expected there. In any case the voter can become a single point of global failure.. ",True,3
What is the main advantage of using active modules for comparison tasks in a system?,"The comparison task can also be performed by the active modules themselves by monitoring each other and coming to a democratic (voting) decision if there are differences. This method needs a longer decision time than a dedicated voter, but the implementation of a more complex comparing mechanism is possible.",True,3
What additional decision-making abilities does an external supervisor possess compared to a module-internal supervisor?,"An external supervisor recognizes errors, indeed, later than a module-internal supervisor; however, it has more decision possibilities, such as for example",True,2

What component controls the tristate buffers in each bus connection of the modules?,1. Each bus connection of the modules has a tristate buffer which is under the control of the supervision unit.,True,3
What is a consequence of turning off modules in a bus system regarding data retention?,"2. Allbus connections to the bus go through resistors (insulators), and the supervision unit is able to inter- rupt the power of every module separately. This method is more economic and safer, and one can save power. But the bus becomes slower and turn- ing off modules implies loss of information and requires a more complex recovery mechanism.4 4.6.4.3 Self-checking Pairs",True,3

What method can be used to detect and correct errors in a redundant system with three modules?,"cannot be corrected. We see the difference, but we cannot say which one is right and which is wrong. By using three redundant modules errors can be detected, localized and corrected (two of three, a democratic decision), so that a single error has no effect on the following superior modules [4.6.7]. By using two re- dundant modules, a self-checking pair or trustworthy module can be built up. A trustworthy module is par- tially correct so that it supplies only correct results, or none in the case of error. ",True,4
What is the role of a trustworthy module in enhancing fault tolerance?,"A trustworthy module alone is not fault tolerant, but it is a good component to build fault tolerance. It can also be used only as a fail-safe module. With this configuration the module should supply a safe reaction (e.g., emergency stop) or start an emergency program if an error is detected.. ",True,3
"What are the possible roles of signal (OK) provided by modules A, B, and C in a fault-tolerant system?","Figure 4.6.14 shows three possibilities for trust- worthy modules (A, B, C).

This signal can also be used to isolate modules from the rest of the system in case of (internal) errors.4.6.4.4 Fault-Tolerant Structures",True,3
How does the primary component respond to an error in a fault-tolerant system?,"A fault-tolerant module can be built by using of two trustworthy modules [4.6.7]. One of them is the pri- mary module (worker), the other one is a shadow module (monitor). The monitor runs in parallel with the worker, but does not interfere. The primary module has control of the system until it recognizes an internal error or until it fails. In this case the fai- led module keeps silent and executes a recovery. ",True,3
What triggers the shadow module to become active during system operations?,"The shadow module detects the failure of the worker and immediately takes over the role of the worker, assu- ming the control function for the system. When the first module is again ready for operation, it takes the roll of the shadow (monitor) module and remains silent in readiness. If the shadow module recognizes an internal error, it executes a recovery in silence. The shadow module becomes active when it notices that the expected reaction (“OK” signal) of the primary module does not arrive on time or after an agreement between both modules (communication protocols).

The error coverage is lower, but for a satellite mission it is high enough [4.6.10], [4.6.11].",True,3
What are the potential consequences of identical trustworthy modules encountering simultaneous internal errors?,"It becomes unpleasant if both trustworthy modules find an internal error at the same time. Then both withdraw to carry out a recovery and the system remains without control. This can happen, for example, if both trustworthy modules are identical and have the same development error. Ironically it would have been better not to recognize the error because to do nothing (no reaction of the control) can be worse than doing something wrong.. ",True,3
What redundancy technique involves three or more modules making democratic decisions for fault tolerance?,"It is also possible to construct directly fault-to- lerant modules without using trustworthy modules.

What happens when all three outputs from a TMR configuration are different?,"With a TMR configuration three similar (identical) modules are used. They execute the same task. A voter checks whether all three modules provide identical results. If this is the case, the result is forwarded. If one result differs, it will be masked out (ignored) and the value of the two identical results will be forwarded (democratically). If all three results are different, then we have a big problem. ",True,4
What does TMR technology accomplish regarding faulty results during operations?,"But beware: the fact that two results are identical does not necessarily mean that they are correct, only that they are very probably correct.

What is the minimum number of astronauts required for maintenance tasks aboard the space station?,"the Space Shuttle Columbia, the crew was even reduced to two astronauts. This was done to conserve resour- ces, which could only be brought to the station by the Progress and Soyuz transporters. This remained the situation during the period from February 2003 to July 2006. However, the size of the space station and the multitude of servicing tasks require a minimum crew of two astronauts just for ongoing maintenance. ",True,1
How many astronauts are typically needed for prolonged scientific experiments?,"For sustained work on the scientific experiments, the experience of the last few years has shown that a crew of at least three astronauts is required.. ",True,1
What organization is responsible for negotiating crew composition for the space station?,"The composition of each crew is negotiated by an international body, the Multilateral Crew Operation Panel (MCOP), made up of the partners participa- ting in the space station, namely the USA, Russia, Europe (represented by ESA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and Japan’s Space Agency (JAXA). This panel authorizes ISS training for the astronauts and nominates primary and backup crews. ISS crews are assigned to expeditions. ",True,2
What is the minimum number of individuals in core teams that fly to and return from a space station?,"These are core teams of at least two people who fly to and return from the station together in the same space vehicle. Because of the reduced Space Shuttle flight plan, the expedi- tions continue to fly to the space station and back in the Soyuz capsule.

This was the case for Soyuz replacement missions — the so-called “taxi flights.”",True,3
What is the relationship between the ISS commander and the ISS flight director?,"For the space station crew two positions are defi- ned: the station commander (ISS CDR) and the flight engineer (FE-1, FE-2). The authority of the ISS CDR is described in the Space Station Code of Conduct” and is legally binding for all designated ISS crew members for the duration of their training and flight. In turn the ISS CDR is responsible to the ISS flight director at Mission Control Centre in Houston for all aspects associated with the safe and successful realization of the mission. ",True,2
What roles are shared by the ISS commander and flight engineers during expeditions?,"Although all partner control centers are basically responsible for their own space station con- tribution, the special role of the ISS flight director is specifically emphasized with respect to the ISS crew. This is a reflection of the major contribution of the USA to the ISS. Both positions, ISS commander and flight engineers, share the routine and special tasks that are to be carried out during the expedition. (See the example for a CQRM shown in Figure 5.1.1.). ",True,2
What must be assured when a crew member is trained for complex repairs?,"All the tasks to be dealt with during an expedition are defined and negotiated long before the event and specified in various documents.’ The result is a collec- tion of major objectives for each expedition as well as different training requirements. If a crew member undergoes extensive training as a specialist for particu- larly difficult repairs or overhauls, it must be guaran- teed at the same time that the necessary replacement parts for this repair will be sent to the space station in time for the work to be carried out..

What is the principle behind access to laboratory facilities on the ISS?,"The underlying concept of the ISS is that of a laboratory providing all partners with free, unlimi- ted access to the laboratory facilities, tools and crew in proportion to their contribution. In principle no distinction is made for a planned experiment as to whether it is carried out by a Japanese or a European astronaut in the Columbus module. In practice, howe- ver, it turns out that, despite the mechanical coupling of the station segments, the station is clearly separated into a Russian part and a part which is operated by the USA and its partners Canada, Europe and Japan. ",True,3
What is the minimum crew time requirement for maintaining the Russian segment of the ISS?,"The maintenance of the Russian segment alone requires the entire crew time of at least one cosmonaut. The US as- tronauts are primarily trained for work, maintenance and the repair of the systems in the US orbital segment and accordingly are assigned these tasks. Despite such restrictions the ISS is the biggest and most successful international civilian project ever realized.. ",True,2

What is the collection of daily tasks available to the ISS crew upon launch called?,"The daily routine on-board the ISS is the result of a long planning process. Parallel to crew training, a catalog of tasks to be accomplished week by week during the expedition is defined by the international planning teams. When the crew is launched, this col- lection of tasks (called the On-Orbit Summary, OOS) is available along with a more detailed breakdown of the individual tasks for each day of the following week. ",True,1
What is the established timeframe for the daily plan that the crew can view on their computers?,"The daily plan, which the crew members on-board also see on their computers, is in final form up to four or five days in advance, but can be modified in the course of the various on-board activities. The final plan is sent to the station the evening before, after it has been agreed by the planning groups. Changes that occur afterwards are discussed with the crew in daily planning conferences. These planning conferences take place each morning and evening and are fixed points in the daily routine. ",True,2
"What time zone do the clocks on the ISS follow, and how does it impact the crew's schedule?","Between waking up at 06:00‘ and the planning conference two hours later, 4 The entire crew follows a common schedule without work shifts. The clocks on-board the ISS are set to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which also does not change during the summer months. This is a compromise to make a joint planning routine possible for the participating control centers. Because of the 16 Earth rotations per day, day and night on Earth naturally play no role on-board the ISS in giving a subjective sense of time.. ",True,3

How many hours of fitness training are scheduled within the daily timeline?,"After the 15 minute planning conference, in which all crew members and control centers participate, the astronauts follow their individual time line until a common meal at noon. The same is true of the afternoon up to the planning conference in the eve- ning. During the morning and afternoon, two and a half hours of fitness training is also scheduled. This includes the time necessary to change clothes and for personal hygiene. ",True,2
What tasks are recommended for the crew after their daily work?,"After the day’s work the crew has time for an evening meal and to prepare for the following day. Because of the many replacement parts, experiments and consumables stored everywhere on- board, it is advisable to collect in advance whatever is going to be needed for the following day. This is also the time to answer emails, to make any notes that there was no time for during the day, or to telephone friends and family. ",True,1
What limits the working hours for the crew on the station?,"The crew can make telephone calls via a broadband communication channel to Earth via relay satellites. This is a huge improvement compared to the era of the MIR space station, when communication was only possible during flights over Soviet ground stations. The working day is limited to a maximum of eight hours, including preparati- on, follow-up and sport activities. An international team of ISS crew surgeons monitors adherence to this time schedule. ",True,2
How should interruptions to rest due to work be balanced?,"Interruptions to sleep, due to such things as unavoidable work on experiments, must be compensated with the equivalent free time. Nevertheless, members of long-duration expeditions reported that they actually never felt off duty, which is understandable in view of the unusual workplace and challenging environment.. ",True,2
What is the main strategy employed to manage crew workload during sleep periods on the station?,"Experience with the MIR space station has shown that overworking the crew is a constant risk. There- fore, in contrast to short Space Shuttle flights with spacelab, there are no work shifts for the European Columbus module. While the crew sleeps, the ground stations take control of the station via telemetry and telecommanding. Acoustic signals and warnings are suppressed and problem solving is postponed to the next morning wherever possible. ",True,2
What is the maximum duration allocated for technical and research work on Saturdays?,"On Saturdays, in general, two hours at most is spent on technical and research work.

What determines astronaut selection based on their organization's involvement in the ISS?,Two criteria were mentioned above for arriving at composition of an ISS expedition crew. The first determines which astronauts from the various part- ner organizations participate in accordance to their organization’s share in the ISS. The second criterion is that the crew as a whole must cover all the neces- sary qualifications as specified in the CQRM. Simply bringing experts together to form a team that has to subsequently dedicate itself in almost complete isolation to a set of tasks for a period of time does not guarantee success. ,True,2
What factors are considered when determining the composition of expedition teams?,"Much empirical information is available on comparable situations, such as teams which spend the winter at polar stations, teams of mountain climbers or, in general, expedition teams in remote areas of the world. Discussions about the right crew composition include all the usual criteria such as the optimal number,’ whether the crew should be mixed or of the same gender,’ and hierarchy and seniority issues.’ There is no reliable formula which guarantees a harmonious and successful crew com- position. Nevertheless, there are a few characteristics which have supported especially successful ISS crews in their work.. ",True,2
What programs were astronauts recruited for before being assigned to long-term missions?,"The Astronaut Selection ProcessCurrent astronauts in the US, European and Japanese teams were not recruited specifically for long-term missions on board the ISS, but for programs which were relevant at the time of their recruitment. Exam- ples are the Space Shuttle program with its brief flights (also with Spacelab), or the Columbus program with its emphasis on laboratory work, but also the later",True,2

What type of crew composition has been supported by evidence from female astronauts on long-term missions?,"6 Several female astronauts who completed long-term expe- ditions have in the meantime demonstrated that in view of the work performed on-board, all the evidence supports having a mixed crew. However, intrusive attention from the media is to be expected.",True,2
What type of objectives does the ISS primarily fulfill?,7 It should be noted that the ISS serves to fulfill civilian scientific and technical objectives and normally manages quite well with a fairly shallow hierarchy.

What challenges did NASA face in recruiting candidates for missions on a space station?,"abandoned Hermes space glider project. Only Rus- sia has not changed its recruitment criteria and the composition of its crews based on its experience with the MIR station. The relatively new requirements for astronauts are symptomatic of the difficulties NASA had in finding candidates for the expeditions on- board the MIR station. Even today, the long training period for a flight to the ISS and the special tasks on- board the ISS are far more demanding than what is required for a short mission. ",True,3
"What factors are more influential in selection processes, especially concerning national initiatives?","In addition, selection is typically influenced more by national programs and priorities than by ability to work in an international environment.. ",True,2
What was the primary language used for communication aboard the MIR space station?,"The Cultural Component The Russian-US collaboration on the MIR station showed how important it is for the team to have a good command of at least one common language. The dominant language on-board MIR was Russian. But even today, when English is the main language used on the ISS, the team members are more in tune with each other if the Americans and Russians understand each other and each other’s station-to-ground communica- tions. ",True,2
What challenges do crew members face regarding technology and scheduling while operating a space station?,"The solution to this is an intensive and lengthy linguistic immersion in the other country before the flight. This can, however, conflict with the training regime and the wish to be with one’s family. However, overcoming the language barrier is not enough. Handling the technology, the repair strategy, on-board equipment storage and the scarce amounts of free time, which the control centers allow the crew members, are examples of different approaches taken by the west and the east with respect to operating a space station. ",True,3
What is essential for success in adapting work methods and understanding leadership traits?,"Success depends on being extremely flexible with regard to work methodologies, and recognizing and anticipating the different leadership styles of the various control centers. Training units on crew resource management are a useful precautionary measure. They help to make evident the borders between a regulating hierarchy and personal judgment, which is similar to the situation in an aircraft cockpit.. ",True,2
What follows the initial euphoric phase during extended missions in terms of psychological adaptation?,"During long-term missions the initial euphoric phase, which lasts about three to four weeks, is replaced by a routine phase. This is characterized by repetitive work, situations where an astronaut makes a mistake for the5 Aspects of Human Space Flight",True,2
What can disrupt the monotony of daily activities in a space environment?,"first time, and especially by the monotony of daily routine, which is governed by the constant necessity to stay physically fit and to adhere to a strict schedule. Sensory and communicative limitations also play a role here. This phase can be interrupted by external factors such as the arrival of a Progress/ATV transport vehicle or bya planned space walk. The ground control centers also watch for signs of moodiness amongst crew mem- bers and take corrective action since these symptoms increase the likelihood and frequency of operational errors. ",True,2
What factors are considered decisive for mission success among long-term crew members?,"Such moodiness disappears as the flight comes to an end and activities associated with packing up and documentation begin, which require a high level of concentration. At this stage positive anticipation of the return to Earth dominates. Decisive for success, however, is the will of each individual member of a long-term crew to regard every moment of the flight as a contributing factor to the overall success of the entire mission, and at the same time to regard this as an integral part of their freely chosen career. ",True,4
How has the focus shifted from finding individuals with the right qualities to assembling a technically skilled team?,The ex- pectation of some kind of reward after a flight has not proven to be a worthwhile incentive for dealing with the sometimes unexpectedly frustrating monotony of the tasks on-board compared to idealized expectations. So the search for astronauts having the “right stuff” during the early days of space flight has now become a search for the “right staff” — for a crew which is tech- nically excellent but which also brings along sufficient inner motivation to ensure a cohesive team capable of coping with the difficult phases of the flight.. ,True,3

What factors determine the thermal comfort range for humans in a ventilated module?,"Since there is no natural air convection under micro- gravity conditions, the air in a space station would be immobile and the astronauts would breathe in most of the CO,-laden air which they had just exhaled. For this reason, air-conditioning is not only a com- fortable convenience but absolutely vital, and the air circulation ventilator is accordingly redundantly designed, see Figure 5.2.3. The limiting factor for the extent of ventilation in the module is the thermal comfort range for humans, which is primarily de- termined by the air temperature and velocity, and the humidity.

What is the purpose of the HEPA filter in the air treatment process?,"Before air enters the module it passes through a particle filter (HEPA), after which it is cooled in a heat exchanger module and dried, if necessary. It is then uniformly distributed to the inhabited areas via two sets of four ceiling outlets (diffusors). Used air is sucked out of the module through an air vent in the front floor area, whereby 50% returns to the cabin via the recirculating air fan and 50% is routed to the US laboratory for processing, see Figure 5.2.4..

What component is utilized to cool and dehumidify the air inside a spacecraft's cabin?,"than for heating the cabin. The dominant humidity sources on a space station come from astronauts, who exhale moisture and perspire, and from moist cloth or laundry drying in the cabin air. In order not to exceed a maximum relative humidity of 75%, the cabin air has to be dried. This is accomplished by a condensing heat exchanger which both cools and dries the air.",True,3
What is the upper relative humidity limit set to prevent on the inner surfaces of the outer shell?,"The upper limit for relative humidity is chosen so that no condensate can form on the inner surfaces of the outer shell. Damp substances and condensate would lead to microbial growth and mold, which was a major problem on the MIR space station. The lower relative humidity level of 25% was chosen to minimize the risk of electrostatic charge and subse- quent discharge sparking caused by air that is too dry, and to keep the mucous membranes of the astronauts from drying out..

What component regulates the division of incoming air in the cooling system of the cabin?,"loop, LTL) of the ISS flows in on the water side and cools down the cabin air. A temperature control valve (TCV) is nothing but an air flap which divides the incoming air stream, directing it to the two transfer blocks. Cooling water flows through only one of the two transfer blocks. If the need for cooling increases, then the TCV directs more air through the cooled block, and vice versa. The cabin air cannot be actively heated. The heat loads are usually sufficient to incre- ase the air temperature.. ",True,3
What is the potential issue caused by condensate collecting on heat exchangers in microgravity environments?,"When moist air is cooled, water drops usually form on the cold surfaces of a heat exchanger. Under micro- gravity they would be swept along by the air stream and return to the cabin via the air outlets, which could lead to short circuits in the electrical equipment. It is therefore critical that any condensate forming on the heat exchanger be safely removed. The technology applied for Columbus is shown in Figure 5.2.5.. ",True,3
What role does the hydrophilic layer play in the droplet condensation process on air fins?,"The air fins on which the droplets condense have a biocidal, hydrophilic coating. Less than 1 rm thick, this hydrophilic layer causes the water droplets to flow over the fin surface as a film. This liquid film is then transported via the air stream to the end of the fin, where it is sucked between the capillary plates due to capillary forces and drawn off through holes as a condensate—air mixture with the help of the condensate water separator assembly (CWSA).

What substance is used in the coating to inhibit microbial growth on the heat exchanger?,"In order to prevent microbial growth on the moist surface of the heat exchanger, the coating contains silver oxide as a biocidal substance. During its 10-year lifetime it is slowly released to the condensate, thereby reliably preventing the growth of microorganisms. In addition, at intervals of three to four weeks the cooling is switched from one to the other heat transfer block. This gives the moist block a chance to dry out, which also hinders the growth of microorganisms.. ",True,2
What type of separator is depicted in Figure 5.2.3?,"The CWSA in Figure 5.2.3 is a centrifugal sepa- rator which conveys the condensate back to the US laboratory for processing. Whereas the modules on the US side of the ISS (US laboratory, Nodes 2 and 3, JEM, Columbus) all have their own condensing heat exchangers, the air in the Russian modules (FGB1, SM, MLM) is cooled and dried centrally in the service module (SM).",True,2

What is the average daily carbon dioxide exhalation per astronaut in kilograms?,"An astronaut exhales on average almost exactly 1 kg of carbon dioxide per day. This means that if six as- tronauts are on the ISS, then 6 kg per day, or 2190 kg of CO, per year, have to be filtered out of the cabin air and disposed of. This is the function of the carbon dioxide removal assembly (CDRA) in the US labo- ratory and of VOSDUKH on the Russian side; see Figure 5.2.6.

What material is utilized for carbon dioxide adsorption in the closed loop system under discussion?,"On the European side, another technology is being developed in the closed loop air revitalization system (ARES). It is based on the capability of carbon dioxide to adsorption on the surface of ASTRINE™, a specially developed ion exchange resin. As in the case of zeoliths, cycling takes place between at least two beds; that is, one bed is always in the adsorption phase while the other desorbs. The air does not have to be dried or processed in advance when using solid amines because the bonding is only slightly influenced. ",True,3

What temperature range is used for regenerating the bed saturated with CO?,"Regeneration of a bed saturated with CO, is accomplished with slightly overheated water va- por (105-110 °C). The water vapor flows over the ASTRINE™, acting somewhat like a piston which pushes the desorbed CO, in front of it. The advantage of water vapor desorption is that it can take place at ambient pressure (approx. 1 bar) and the desorbed CO, can be easily used to close the oxygen cycle (see the section on oxygen reclamation below).

What is the conversion efficiency range for hydrogen in the described process?,"This is an exothermic reaction initiated merely by the addition of energy. The water which is generated can be used in the electrolyzer; there is no use for the methane on the ISS so it is discarded into space. The conversion efficiency for the hydrogen is between 90 and 100%, depending on the operating point.

What alternative solution is required for oxygen generation during lunar or Mars missions?,"defective, lithium hydroxide cartridges are on hand for CO, absorption; if the electrolyzer fails, oxygen cartridges are ignited to produce oxygen until a re- placement unit can be provided. This design philo- sophy is viable because the ISS is regularly resupplied from Progress and Soyuz rockets. For lunar or Mars missions another solution would be necessary.",True,3
What storage method exemplifies a two-failure-tolerant approach for hazardous liquids in space missions?,"In connection with a failure-tolerant design, the concept of design to minimum risk is used. Liquids that can seriously endanger health and thus represent a “catastrophic” threat for the astronauts have to be locked away with a two-failure-tolerant approach. One could also say that possible contact with this liquid by an astronaut must be hindered by two-failure tolerance. This might be realized, for example, by sto- ring it in two nested containers. ",True,2
What design strategy can minimize risk in liquid containment systems with a single container?,"If one container fails, the other could still prevent contact with the liquid. But it is also possible to lock away the liquid in only one container, making it so massive (designing it to minimum risk) that its failure according to the state of the art is not plausible.. ",True,3
What design philosophy addresses the failure of critical units in a life support system?,"Most of the equipment in the life support system is zero-failure tolerant: that is, if the unit fails, then its function is not available (the failure of the electro- lyzer, for example, would lead to the end of oxygen production with this equipment). However, the design philosophy would then specify either the operation of a duplicate aggregate, or the availability of another unit that can guarantee the performance of the function. ",True,3
What type of tolerance is exhibited by ventilation functions in modules?,"Exceptions confirm the rule here, too. For example, the functions of ventilation between modules, ventilation within a module, heat removal and monitoring the module atmosphere are all one-failure tolerant.. ",True,2
What is the primary focus of the US electrolyzer's design concerning failure and maintenance?,"There are other differences in design philosophies regarding individual aggregates. For example, the US electrolyzer is composed of several orbital replacement units (ORUs). These are a number of interconnected individual components regarded as one unit and replaced as such in case of failure. In other words, NASA puts a priority on the reparability of equipment. Although the Russians also use water electrolysis for oxygen generation, the Russian electrolyzer on the space station is not designed to be repaired in orbit; it has to be replaced if it fails..

"What significant event in space occurred on March 16, 1966, involving Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott?","The first rendezvous and docking, that is the first mating of two Earth-orbiting systems in space, took place on March 16, 1966, when Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott maneuvered a Gemini capsule toward an unmanned “Agena” vehicle. Since then, numerous docking maneuvers have been performed and with the installation and operation of space stations (Russian, American and today the International Space Station SS)) it has become increasingly a standard maneuver for servicing vehicles. ",True,3
What type of vehicles have automatic systems been developed for servicing?,"Accordingly, automatic systems have been developed, implemented and successfully pplied, in particular for unmanned servicing vehicles. Though well mastered and “quasi-standard,” the maneuver remains risky and is safety critical, as can be seen by numerous small and sometimes large mishaps, like the Progress/MIR accident in June 1997. Maybe this is the reason why manually controlled docking is still the preferred method for servicing vehicles like the American Space Transportation System (STS), the Space Shuttle, when visiting the ISS.

What are the main sequential steps involved in a rendezvous mission to a space station?,"5.3.2 The RVD MissionThe rendezvous typically comprises the steps (a) “pha- sing,” (b) “far-range approach, (c) “final (or short- range) approach” and (d) “docking” (or berthing, if no mating is performed). In the case of a mission to the space station, the servicing is followed by (e) “separa- tion and departure” and finally (f) “deorbiting.”",True,3
What is the main goal of synchronizing orbits during phasing in space missions?,"The primary objective of phasing is synchro- nization of the chaser orbit with the target orbit (anomaly, eccentricity, semi-major axis). This is achie- ved by executing a number of orbit transfer maneuvers, the execution errors of which are corrected by a number of small “trim” maneuvers. Due to the rather long time period between such maneuvers (mainly velocity increments), they may be calculated on the ground with the information then being uploaded by telecommand.. ",True,3
What type of guidance and navigation is primarily used during the far-range approach phase?,"When the desired conditions in terms of position and velocity are reached, the far-range approach starts.The transition point is not fixed but depends on the accuracy and performance of the on-board ren- dezvous and docking (RVD) system (Figure 5.3.1). Within this phase absolute guidance and navigation is usually replaced by relative guidance and naviga- tion.",True,2
What types of control are required for vehicles in proximity to a target considering accuracy needs?,"At the end of the far-range approach the chasing vehicle is already in the vicinity of the target so that additional requirements and constraints such as exclusion zones and approach corridors become applicable.

What type of docking mechanism is used in the ISS besides the Russian system?,"The docking maneuver itself depends very much on the docking mechanism. The ISS is equipped with two types of mechanisms, the Russian “probe and drogue” and the American APDS (Androgenous Peripheral Docking System). For unmanned missions such as for a Mars sample return mission, there is no need for pressurization and fluid transfer through the docking port, thus resulting in a much simpler, lighter and cheaper mechanism..

Here a thorough checkout of all sys- tems is performed. Thereafter clearance is given for a further approach to about 15 km, this time controlled by on-board systems. The subsequent phase depends on the selected docking port at the station, which can be either in the velocity direction (V-bar) or ina direction toward the center of the Earth (R-bar). ",True,3
What is the initial point for V-bar hopping in relation to the docking port?,"In the case of V-bar, a point about 300 m in front of the docking port is acquired. This is the starting point for so-called “V-bar hopping,” an approach method which complies with the safety requirements (see also Section 5.3.3). In the case of an R-bar docking, a braking maneuver is performed at the point where the trajectory crosses the prolonged R-bar axis and then so-called “R-bar hopping” is started toward the docking port (see Figure 5.3.2)..

What is the total thrust provided by the two thrusters in the orbit maneuvering system?,"The shuttle mass is about 100 t. Consequently, strong thrusters are needed for the orbital maneuvers, particularly during phasing and deorbiting. This is provided by the orbit maneuvering system (OMS) with its two 26 700 N thrusters. Smaller maneuvers as needed for the proximity operations are performed by the activation of a combination of the 38 RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, each providing 3870 N, and the six vernier engines with a thrust level of 110 N each..

How are phasing orbits for Soyuz and Progress ensured to be coplanar with the target?,"In contrast to the shuttle, the phasing of Soyuz and Progress is not performed in eccentric orbits but essen- tially in circular orbits. Arrival and departure of these phasing orbits are performed by ground-controlled Hohmann maneuvers. Appropriate node corrections ensure a coplanar orbit with the target at the end. The far-range approach is performed automatically by the on-board systems and starts with a transfer maneuver toward an aiming point on the target orbit about 1.5 km in front of the target. ",True,2

What equation relates required velocity increment to burn duration in thruster maneuvers?,"The desired velocity increments are realized by appropriate commands to the thrusters.

A typical impact over several orbital revolutions is shown in Figure 5.3.7 for an ATV (chaser) and ISS (target) configuration.

What type of maneuver is applied during the closing phase from S to S?,"When clearance is given for the rendezvous, the “closing” from S, to S; is performed by applying a V-bar hop. As for homing, the transfer includes two correction maneuvers and aims at a hold point outside the KOS in front of the approach cone. It is worth mentioning that by selecting a transfer duration of less than half an orbital revolution, a trajectory is estab- lished which follows the passive safety concept; that is, in case of loss of control the free flight trajectory will have an average drift away from the station.

What types of motion laws characterize trajectories in close proximity?,"In close proximity the trajectories are compo- sed of segments following simple laws like constant acceleration, constant velocity or linear variation of the velocity as a function of distance (see also Figure 5.3.12).. ",True,2
What is the term for the attitude enabling solar arrays to point towards the Sun while maintaining one axis towards Earth?,"Four solar arrays are available for power genera- tion. Since they can be rotated only around one axis, the ATV needs to establish a certain attitude to allow the solar array area vector to point directly toward the Sun (best efficiency for power generation). The attitude allowing this while keeping one axis pointing to Earth is called “yaw steering.” Figure 5.3.16 shows the principle. The ATV rotates around the z-axis (pointing towards Earth) such that a second rotation can be performed by the solar arrays, allowing Sun pointing of the latter.. ",True,2
What is the condition for applying the yaw steering concept regarding solar elevation angles?,"Figure 5.3.16: Yaw steering.For small solar elevation angles f (this angle between the orbital plane and the Sun is a function of season), high angular rates would be requested around z. Therefore this concept is applied only for B> 10°.",True,2
What filter technique is used for optimal state estimation of position and velocity in navigation?,"The state estimation within the navigation function applies Kalman filter techniques for the optimal deter- mination of position, velocity, attitude and attitude rate, both absolute and relative. With the exception of the last meter, translational and rotational motions are decoupled.",True,4
What mathematical representation is used to avoid singularities in attitude kinematics?,"The attitude estimation is based on four gyros, each of which provides a two degrees of freedom measurement. Since gyros are affected by a drift effect, the estimation is regularly updated by means of star sensor measurements. To avoid singularities (also known as gimbal lock) the attitude kinematics are formulated in terms of quaternions (see [5.3.6]). As for classical satellites, an emergency or “survival” mode is defined, the major objective being to ensure sufficient power generation and provide a communi- cation link with the mission control center. To support this mode, the MSU has access to two dedicated Sun sensors.. ",True,3
What types of sensors are used for position estimation and maneuver monitoring in the system?,"For position estimation, two nine-channel GPS receivers are available, and for monitoring the ma- neuvers three two-axis accelerometers.When the local link is established, the GPS measurements from the receiver of the ISS are available within the GNC of the ATV. Selecting the measurements of the same GPS satellites as taken2/24/09 5:23:09 PM CHOS5.indd 456",True,4
What method is used for relative position and bearing angle measurements within 200 meters of the ISS?,"by the ATV receiver allows cancellation of common mode errors and provides high-precision “relative” navigation with respect to the ISS (sometimes called relative GPS). But in the close vicinity of the ISS even this accuracy is not good enough. Moreover, RF re- flections from the ISS may disturb the measurements (multipath effects). Therefore, for distances smaller than about 200 m a video camera is used for relative position and bearing angle measurements. ",True,3
How is relative altitude measured during the final approach phase in a docking procedure?,During the last part of the approach (< 40 m) relative at- titude measurements can be derived by evaluating the image of the target pattern mounted close to the docking port.. ,True,3
What types of measurements do the laser-based sensors provide in the monitoring system?,"For independent monitoring of this system two laser-based telegoniometers are available. Like the camera, these sensors provide range and bearing angle measurements.",True,2
What type of control mode is activated to minimize fuel use during drift phases?,"The attitude control is performed fully auto- nomously. The required torques are provided by short impulses of the attitude control thrusters. To reduce fuel consumption during the long-lasting drift phases, a specific control mode is activated which allows one thruster only to fire within a control cycle.",True,3
What type of thrusters are used for minor adjustments during the mission?,"During the mission, large transfer maneuvers and small correction maneuvers are distinguished. The first are performed with the four main engines of the orbital control system. They require a proper alignment of the ATV to obtain the desired thrust direction; generally an appropriate slewing maneuver is required before and after. The smaller correction maneuvers can be performed with attitude cont- rol thrusters. ",True,2
What type of maneuver is not required due to the ability to generate thrust in three axes?,"Their configuration allows thrust to be generated in all three axes so that appropriate thruster commanding gives a thrust vector in any direction, thus avoiding the need for a dedicated slew maneuver.. ",True,3
How is impulse calculated in relation to thrust level and control cycle?,"The control of the 28 ACTs is not trivial. The GNC computes from the deviation between the set point and the actual state a continuously varying request of forces (from position control) and torques (from attitude control). This force-torque vector needs to be translated into appropriate commanding of the thrusters. This is done within the thruster ma- nagement function (TMF). Since the thrusters are either on or off, neither the force nor the torque is used but rather the impulse. The maximum impulse corresponds to the thrust level times the control cycle. ",True,3
What optimization problem is described that aims to minimize thruster usage in human space flight?,"5 Aspects of Human Space Flighttime of the discrete controller. Modulating the time gives a quasi-linear variation of the impulse. To save fuel the number of thrusters involved to realize the required impulse is minimized; that is, there is a linear optimization problem, as given below:fix fre fae F, fiy fry fay uy f, tix by tnx : T, hy ty wm thy Uy T, he tb, te T,with |u;|<1and 0 <a <1",True,4
What does the multiplication of u components by control sample time yield for thruster commands?,"A-u=a-C, It can be solved by the well-known simplex algorithm (see [5.3.8]). The u; components give the percentage time of the control cycle needed to realize the reques- ted impulse. Multiplying this by the control sample time gives the command to be issued to the thrusters (more precisely, to the PDE units).",True,2
What is the impact of iteration limits on achieving optimal solutions in flexible systems?,"This approach is rather flexible, particularly in view of configuration changes as a function of mission success or failure. However, due to the iterative search for an optimum solution, convergence within a pre- defined number of iterations cannot be guaranteed; that is, deterministic behavior with respect to time as needed for a real-time system is not ensured. On the other hand, simple termination of the optimization process after a predefined number of cycles does not guarantee an acceptable solution.. ",True,3
What is the characteristic of the approach that requires new data tables for each failure case?,"An alternative to this optimal approach is a sub- optimal approach. In this concept a fixed allocation of thrusters to a well-defined force-torque impulse is stored in terms of tables. Since these tables are valid only for a fixed set of thrusters, they need to be defined for each possible configuration, that is each failure case triggers the need for a new table. In addition the solution is suboptimal and less accurate. ",True,3
What type of behavior does the preferred solution for the ATV provide?,"Nevertheless, the differences are small and it provides deterministic behavior; therefore it was the preferred solution for the ATV.. ",True,2

What is essential for accurate verification in simulations of space environments?,"The space environment constraints (vacuum, zero g, temperature, illumination, etc.) are difficult to mimic on the ground. As a consequence, simulation by appropriate simulators [5.3.4] is needed for the verification process. The driving element is the cor- rect mathematical modeling of the environment and all perturbation effects on the equations of motion, including disturbances from the vehicle system itself (e.g., fuel sloshing, flexible appendices). ",True,3
What is required to assess the functionality of sensors such as star sensors and GPS receivers?,"Also the sti- muli of sensors (e.g., stimulation of star sensors with a star pattern, or the stimulation of a GPS receiver with an appropriate RF signal) need to be simulated.. ",True,2
How do flexible appendices impact modeling accuracy in orbital mechanics?,"The orbital mechanics including perturbations like air drag, nonspherical gravitational field, Earth’s magnetic field, solar activity, influence of the ionos- phere on RF signals, etc., are well known. Flexible appendices and fuel sloshing can also be modeled with high accuracy. Compromises, however, have to made with respect to model complexity and fidelity (i.e., the model has to be simplified to obtain reasonable computation times for real-time testing, or simply to reduce cost). ",True,3
What factors may lead to higher expenses during the implementation and verification of a testing environment?,"In the development phase the effort and cost of the implementation and verification of the test environment are quite significant and may well exceed the cost for the development of the item to be tested. However, since these are on the ground they can be derived or adapted from preceding pro- jects or provided and reused in successive projects if developed according to an appropriate standard (ECSS for space)..

What consequences can arise from uncertainties in specified parameters during real-world applications?,Nevertheless there are always uncertainties within the defined parameters and the impact of neglected effects causes deviations when confronted with reality.,True,2
What specific operations were executed during the first ATV mission to enhance mission reliability?,"The ultimate test is the real flight, or a dedicated de- monstration or test flight. Due to the high related costs, a demonstration flight of the ATV was not planned, but a number of specific tests were embed- ded in the first ATV (Jules Verne) mission to increase confidence in mission success. This included the execution of a CAM maneuver well away from the station, a mission interruption (within the KOS), and a retreat to S;, where an appropriate escape maneuver was commanded from the ground followed by the initiation of a new sequence of phasing, proximity operations and a new rendezvous approach.

What is the significance of the mission operations phase following the launch of a rocket?,The mission operations phase after liftoff of the launch rocket shows whether all previous considerations have proven to be correct and will lead to a successful mis- sion. Public interest in a mission — which shows the fascination of space flight — is especially high during this early phase and at critical moments of a mission. Then mission operations are in full focus and often determine mission success or failure.. ,True,3
What is the main focus of mission preparation prior to the launch of a spacecraft?,"The objective to explore new, unknown paths con- stantly encourages new ideas from scientists, engineers and technicians. Therefore, no one mission is the same as another. Suspense will always be immanent in future missions even though it is the ultimate goal of mission preparation to define detailed mission sce- narios and eliminate flaws early before liftoff.

What components are included in the operations infrastructure for mission operations?,"A significant part of the operations of the space segment is conducted from the ground. Thus the correlation between hardware, software and involved personnel is nowhere more visible than in mission operations.

Describe the primary approach for managing spacecraft operations during various mission phases.,"Spacecraft operations during all active mission phases are generally carried out following an “off-line” approach. All activities are preplanned and the resul- ting telecommands are uplinked to the spacecraft for time-tagged execution (on-board mission timeline). Telemetry evaluation is also mainly off-line, with the limited possibility of quasi-real-time intervention in se- lected critical phases and in major contingency cases.. ",True,3
What is the main purpose of the radio frequency communications with the spacecraft?,"The radio frequency contacts between the ope- rations control center and the spacecraft are in most cases not continuous and are primarily used for pre- programming autonomous operation functions on the spacecraft, and for data collection for subsequent off-line status assessment. The downlink will nor- mally be so configured that most of the bandwidth is dedicated to the dump of telemetry stored on-board, with limited housekeeping and/or event telemetry transmitted in real time during the pass according to spacecraft monitoring requirements.

Some mis- sion phases are planned without ground support for payload operation (i.e., the instruments will remain inactive or in basic, safe and autonomous low-activity modes).. ",True,3
What must be integrated into the spacecraft to enable autonomous functionality across systems and subsystems?,"Operations during the routine operations phase are preplanned and spacecraft health and mission progress monitoring is conducted off-line after delay- ed recovery of the required telemetry.

What is the primary goal of ground intervention after a spacecraft failure?,"In case of failures, ground intervention will nor- mally take place a considerable time — depending on the mission phase — after the intervention of the on-board systems.

What processes are necessary to correct errors in signals received from satellites before data transmission to the control center?,"After demodulation, the signals are restored to their original form. Due to the trans- mission from space to ground, the limited power on- board the satellites and the given size of the receiving antennas on the ground, the signals received are not free of errors.

",True,3
What factors influence the requirements for ground stations serving different types of satellites?,"The importance of these aspects depends on the exact purpose of the ground station to be built.

",True,2
What is the lowest angle of elevation necessary for satellite functionality?,"In this context, it is important to determine the mi- nimum elevation angle under which the satellite ope- ration can be supported. Nearby hills and mountains help to block radio interference received from distant sources, but they limit the view angle of the satellite and thus shorten the time that a satellite is in the field of view of the ground station. To assess this situation, a horizon profile should be generated for the ground station; an example is depicted in Figure 6.3.4.. ",True,2
What azimuth range allows a clear view of a satellite for elevations above 2°?,"The figure illustrates how the surrounding terrain dictates the horizon. Between 120° and 300° azimuth a clear view of a satellite is given for elevations above 2° except for nearby obstacles. Below 2° satellite operation is not possible. For operation with LEO satellites, an unobstructed view of the entire sky is required. Therefore, obstacles should be in the far distance, and a large area is needed for the antenna. ",True,3

In the near field, the power is distributed cylindrically from the antenna. The anten- na mast (used for antenna calibrations) with a width of 0.7 m has a surface of 0.7 m X 11.0 m = 7.7 m’, with which it blocks the radiation of the ground station and which leads to some 0.4 dB reduction of the field of view.

Often it is desirable to have several antennas for multiple simultaneous satellite links. When real estate is limited, the antennas must then be packed together in a small space. ",True,3
What is the minimum angular clearance recommended when antennas are arranged in a north/south direction?,"If the antennas can be arranged side by side in the east/west direction, they do not cause mutual interference. If this is not possible, they must be co-located in the north/south direction, sufficiently separated so they do not inter- fere with each other. Some antenna manufacturers recommend, for this case, to separate antennas for operation with the geostationary orbit so that an antenna has more than 15° angular clearance to the antenna in front of it (see Figure 6.3.5). One reason for keeping enough separation is the generation of passive intermodulation (PIM).. ",True,3
What factors influence the cost of antenna foundations in sandy and loamy soils?,"Another aspect to be taken into account when placing a ground station is the soil condition. Coastal regions often have quite sandy ground, which leads to expensive foundations; they are quite similar to loamy soils in this regard. Typically, the manufacturer of the antenna will quote the required ground com- pression factor. In any case, it is advisable to obtain an expert opinion on the soil condition to assure a solid and stable antenna foundation. ",True,3

What type of voltage is needed to heat the cathode in a power amplifier used in satellites?,"The TWT amplifier is the most common power amplifier in space applications. Almost all satellites use this type on the downlink from satellite to ground. The tube requires a voltage for the heating of the cathode and a very high voltage of several kilovolts to accelerate the electron beam. The high degree of reliability, as required in satellites, results from the relatively simple peripheral equipment. ",True,2
What is a significant drawback of TWT amplifiers related to their components over time?,"TWT amplifiers also exhibit the high efficiency required in satellites which have limited power on-board, and they have a remarkably broad bandwidth (about one octave) without requi- ring special tuning to carrier frequencies. For this reason their use is also widespread in ground stations to amplify the uplink signals, since they require neither frequency tuning nor mechanical maintenance. One disadvantage is the decreasing power of the aging cathode. ",True,3

How do the dimensions of the chambers affect the tuning of the electron beam in a klystron?,"frequency is set by tuning cavities. This causes the electron beam which is generated in the klystron to be mechanically directed through the changes of the tuning sections. By narrowing or widening the cham- bers, the electron beam is tuned to the center frequen- cy, the resonance. Klystrons use four to five chambers to generate a homogeneous transfer function. The bandwidth of the tuning is a function of the gain and the desired output power. ",True,3
How does the gain factor change with bandwidth in a high power amplifier?,"For large bandwidths the gain factor is reduced, and vice versa. The main advantage of this HPA lies in the high radiofrequency power that it produces.. ",True,3
What is the typical output power range for klystrons compared to TWTs?,"For that reason, klystrons are used in commu- nications requiring high power, as well as in pulsed radars. It is reasonable to use them when the required output powers exceed the capabilities of TWTs, that is some kilowatts to several hundred kilowatts, whereby Klystrons operate both at low frequencies as well as at the high end of the frequency spectrum, but they do require substantial effort for general servicing and tuning.

What is the relationship between output power and efficiency in certain devices?,"Also, the higher output power leads to lower efficiency compared to TWTs, and it also requires complex cooling systems (e.g., water cooling).. ",True,3
What is the output power range at S-band for GaAs semiconductor-based amplifiers?,"A state-of-the-art type of amplifier is the solid- state power amplifier (SSPA). The continuous de- velopment of semiconductor technology has led to transistor amplifiers with acceptable efficiencies in the gigahertz range, though the power consumption increases exponentially with frequency. The output power at S-band (2-4 GHz) is presently some 100 W with GaAs semiconductors, with an efficiency of 30-40%. ",True,4
What is one benefit of solid state power amplifiers compared to tube amplifiers regarding warm-up times?,"Power can be increased by paralleling amplifiers which then, of course, need to be tuned in phase. With power combiners, amplifiers can be paralleled also. These show a relatively large input attenuation, as a function of frequency and power, up to 1 dBand more. In summary, for higher frequencies and/or higher power, TWTs and klystrons are clearly superior to SSPAs. The only advantage of SSPAs is the short warm-up times — a tube amplifier requires several minutes for the cathode to heat up.. ",True,2
What methods can be used to prevent arcing in waveguides due to condensates?,"The mounting of the HPA onto the feed sys- tem of the antenna must produce minimum losses. Arcing in the waveguides caused, for example, by condensates can be avoided with nitrogen over- pressure or dry air.

What is the purpose of dual conversion in signal upconversion?,"In the upconverter the modulated signal is trans- posed from intermediate frequency up to transmit frequency. The upconverter consists of a frequency transformation, a synthesizer and a power amplifier. The frequency translation typically is performed in two steps (dual conversion), to avoid intermodulation. The mixer frequencies are generated in digital synthe- sizers and synchronized with temperature-stabilized quartz oscillators or external station reference fre- quencies. The transmit signal then is bandpass filtered and enhanced in a driver amplifier to the input level required by the following HPA.. ",True,4
What purpose does a multichannel converter serve in receive systems?,"In the downconverter the received signal output of the LNA is transposed to an intermediate frequency suitable for the baseband equipment.

What types of modulation are typically used in the uplink process?,"The uplink modulator generates the intermediate frequency with the appropriate power level needed in the upconverter for the modulation used. Typical modulations on the uplink are frequency modulation (FM), phase modulation (PM) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK; see also Section 4.7.6).

What method is used to achieve the highest signal-to-noise ratio for receiving satellite downlink signals?,"The satellite downlink signal is polarized linearly (vertical or horizontal) or circularly (right hand or left hand). Due to impurities the signal will have a certain component in the orthogonal polarization.

What component adjusts the transmit signal to the downlink frequency from the antenna?,"Before the ranging measurement proper, the latency of the station equipment is calibrated. The ranging signal generated in the baseband equipment is modulated, the intermediate-frequency signal up- converted to the transmit frequency, enhanced in the HPA to the required power level and sent by the antenna, which, for this purpose, does not aim at a satellite but at zenith, at 90° elevation. A mixer in the antenna, the “reflective converter,” transposes the transmit signal to the downlink frequency. ",True,3
What process follows the signal reception for measuring latency in a satellite system?,"The signal is then led through the receive chain, starting with the LNA. The downconverter mixes it with the intermediate frequency and it is synchronized and then demodulated in the ranging demodulator. The ranging measurement system now determines the latency of the signal. The station latency is taken into consideration in the ranging of the satellite.. ",True,3
What is the method to determine the latency between a ground station and a satellite during ranging measurement?,"The signal flow in the ranging measurement proper is the same as in the calibration except that the reflective converter is not switched on and the antenna is pointed at the satellite. The satellite must be set to the ranging mode; that is, the uplink ranging signal is added to the telemetry data for the downlink and sent off. In the ranging system, again, the latency of the signal is measured. Subtracting the station latency (as measured in the calibration) and the satellite latency (as supplied by the satellite manufacturer) from the total latency, and then dividing the result by two, leads to the latency between ground station and satellite..

What height range is necessary for a satellite's orbital lifetime to exceed 10 years?,"Below 120 km, a satellite’s lifetime in orbit, which is also strongly dependent on solar activity, is too short for practical purposes. Above 600 km, atmospheric drag, which depends on the size, shape and orientation of the space vehicle, is no longer the limiting factor for service life, which at this orbit height is over 10 years.

What techniques are employed to maintain a Keplerian orbit despite atmospheric drag?,Missions with the goal of utilizing microgravity are likewise limited by the resistance of atmospheric friction or drag. The influence of this force depends on the relationship between the mass and atmosphe- ric drag of the space vehicle. Satellites designed for the special purpose of measuring relativity effects or details of the Earth’s gravitational field have to be kept ina Keplerian orbit independent of residual atmo- spheric drag.

The spectrum of the radiation emitted by the Sun ranges from X-rays to radio waves, with a maximum in the visible range at about 500 nm. This is essentially the spectrum of black body radiation at 5800 K, with variations at the two extreme ends of the hard and infrared radiation ranges.

Only in the immediate vicinity of another body does that body’s own gravity field predominate.",True,3
What percentage of Earth's surface gravity is experienced in stable orbits at approximately 250 km altitude?,"Earth’s gravity field at the altitude of stable orbits, about 250 km, is still about 93% of the value on the Earth’s surface.

What materials can be detected in the optical range from 400 to 750 nm?,"In the optical range, narrow-band radiometers and spectrometers are used to map the ocean sur- face in several spectral channels. Pure water is only “visible” in the wavelength range between 400 and 750 nm. In this range, suspended matter (sediments), chlorophyll (plankton algae) and other organic and inorganic material can be recorded (Figure 7.1.5). In the thermal range, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) can be measured. ",True,3
What is the swath width used by MERIS on ENVISAT for ocean mapping?,"When mapping oceans, global daily coverage is usually desired.

What height variations can be detected by radar sensors used in ocean topography measurements?,"Radar sensors used as altimeters measure ocean topography. The US—French mission TOPEX/POSEI- DON can detect 4-5 cm height differences, for exam- ple. Ocean currents (“the Gulf Stream”) and surface winds can also be measured with this technology.",True,2
What information can be derived from SAR images regarding ocean conditions?,"Active imaging radar sensors (synthetic aperture radar (SAR)) have been used since 1978 (US Seasat) to map the ocean surface and polar ice. Since water acts like a mirror for microwaves, regular wave patterns can be traced in SAR images. These patterns enable conclusions to be drawn about wave height and direc- tion and the velocity of surface winds. Such analyses have applications in the optimal sighting of off-shore wind farms or in detecting oil slicks (because of the attenuation of surface waves). ",True,3
What purpose do special reception modes serve on European satellites for ocean observation?,Special reception modes (“wind and wave mode”) on the European satellites ERS and ENVISAT can be employed to generate small samples (“imagettes”) along the satellite track; taken together these permit regular ocean monitoring.. ,True,2
What type of film was used in the first military reconnaissance mission conducted by the USA?,"Security and Military Applications Most of the systems, technologies and methodo- logies of satellite cartography come from military programs. The first photogrammetric cameras on satellites flew on top-secret missions of the USA and former USSR. On August 18, 1960 the first military reconnaissance mission of the USA, the Discoverer 14 satellite, was launched. The exposed analog film was ejected in a capsule which was captured in flight by dedicated aircraft. ",True,2
What was the geometric resolution range achieved during the missions?,"The geometric resolution was 5-10 m. Because of the typically low orbits and the high consumption of film material, these missions had a short life. The entire program, named CORONA, flew about 95 missions up to 1972. The concept of analog film ejected in film capsules was replaced in the mid-1970s by electronic systems. Meanwhile, the 800 000 analog images have been digitized and made available to the public..

What aspects of US reconnaissance satellites allow them to achieve a geometric resolution of less than 10 cm?,"systems. Nevertheless, the latest generation of US reconnaissance satellites in the optical range is said to achieve geometric resolution below 10 cm. Using geostationary data relay satellites these images are available in real time and presumably also as video sequences. The technical design and size of these satellites can be compared to the Hubble Space Telescope. With enough fuel on board, they can also change their inclination and orbit height during their service life, in order to reach given targets on Earth earlier or more frequently. The satellites operated by the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) go by names such as Keyhole.. ",True,4
What advantages does SAR offer in contrast to optical systems for military applications?,"Because optical systems do not have all-weather capabilities, security applications instead require active radar systems (SAR), which can provide images both at day and night in all sorts of weather. The US military have a few such systems (“Lacrosse”) in operation. The possibility of also using SAR to detect moving objects gave rise to a classified US project to launch a fleet of SAR satellites into orbit in order to record in real time all moving objects on the Earth.

What factors currently hinder implementation due to financial and data management challenges?,At present its realization is precluded by the enormous costs involved and by the very large amounts of data which would have to be managed by the ground segment.. ,True,3
Which country operates optical reconnaissance satellites exclusively for military use?,"Asan effect of its development of the SPOT series of Earth observation satellites, France, as the only country in Europe, operates optical reconnaissance satellites which are only available to the military (Helios 1 and 2). However, cooperation agreements make the data also available to other countries, including Germany, which launched a military SAR system (SAR-Lupe) at the end of 2006. By contrast, a “dual-use” system is represented by the Italian COSMO-SkyMed SAR satellite, which was launched in 2007. ",True,1

What is the main challenge in the initial stages of Earth observation mission planning?,The requirements placed on Earth observation missi- ons come from users as well as systems considerations. A primary task during the definition and design phase of Earth observation missions is to balance both sets of requirements and develop a coordinated mission concept.,True,3
What are the four main categories in which requirements can be organized for the mission’s sensor data?,"For the user, these requirements relate in the first instance to subsequent applications for the mission’s sensor data [7.1.2], whereas the concern of the systems side is technical realization of these requirements, the satellite and its subsystems, the ground segment and later on mission operation. The requirements can be organized into four main groups.7.1.2.1 Observation Profiles",True,2
What applications monitor large regions concerning ecological changes and climate effects?,"Often the user’s interest in Earth observation data is in having access to observation areas of interest which may be scattered over the Earth’s entire surface. The user’s application usually focuses on monitoring large areas: for example, following the transformation into steppes or growing desertification, monitoring the annual vegetation cycle, or keeping track of changes in the polar ice caps. ",True,2
What factors are influenced by a user's need for detailed information in urban environments?,"But the user’s interest may also frequently be in having very detailed information about selected small areas of the type to be found in urban settings, or in discrete objects such as airports, or even individual buildings. These requirements directly influence the mission profile, the design of the orbit and sensing system, and the subsequent data processing. Corresponding to this observation profile, there are different requirements for the orbit, the sensing instrument and the operations plan.. ",True,3
What types of orbits are commonly used for missions involving Earth observation?,"7.1.2.2 Typical Orbits of Earth Observation SatellitesIn general, geostationary as well as circular or even elliptical near-Earth orbits are suitable for Earth observation missions. However, the latter are typically employed for very specialized observation profiles such as reconnaissance missions.Geostationary Orbits",True,2
What is the primary application of satellites in a geostationary orbit?,"The geostationary orbit is used primarily for perma- nent and wide-area observation of the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere for applications in meteorol- ogy, climatology and environmental investigations. Satellites in this orbit are able to permanently monitor a large part of the Earth. Three satellites equally spaced over the equator assure a permanent observation con- stellation for more than 90% of the Earth’s surface. ",True,2
What limits the spatial resolution of optical sensors on geostationary satellites?,"However, the polar regions cannot be included. With the satellites’ continuous observation capability and their fixed position with respect to the Earth’s surface, dynamic processes in the atmosphere such as cloud formation, strong wind phenomena such as cyclones, and the movement of large masses such as desert sand can be well detected and monitored. Because of the satellites’ great distance from the Earth’s surface, the spatial resolution of optical sensors is limited to about 1 km, and relatively long sensor integration times are necessary. Typical representatives of this satellite type are geostationary weather satellites such as Meteosat and GOES.. ",True,3
What are the primary characteristics of orbits that are classified as low Earth circular?,Low Earth Circular Orbits,True,3
What is the altitude range for satellites that achieve medium to high resolution for Earth observation?,"This orbit is primarily used for applications with medium to very high geometric resolution of objects on the Earth’s surface. These satellites use a corridor of about 430-930 km altitude and orbit the Earth with a period of 90-110 minutes, in other words between 13 and 15 times a day. The monitoring of the Earth’s surface is therefore not continuous as in the case of geostationary satellites, but rather occurs in daily flights over the target area. ",True,3
What limits the daily observation duration and contact time with a ground station?,"The number of overpasses and thus the daily observation duration as well as the contact time with a ground station are limited and depend on the geographical position. Contact times are at most 15 minutes during a direct overpass. The preferred orientation for circular orbits is over the poles, because the Earth’s rotation under the satellite orbit plane makes it possible to sense the Earth’s entire surface at regular intervals. ",True,2
What is a significant characteristic of the orientation of Sun-synchronous orbits in relation to solar position?,"An important special case of this orbit orientation is the so-called Sun-synchronous orbit. With careful selection of altitude and inclination (approx. 98°), the precession of this orbit is equal to one rotation per year. Thus the orientation of the orbit is always the same with respect to the Sun, which means that a location on the Earth’s. ",True,3

What type of orbit do some radar satellites utilize to maintain continuous solar illumination for their power systems?,"surface is flown over at the same local time each day, so the solar observation angle remains constant. The result for optical satellites is comparable conditions of illumination for daily observation at the target loca- tion. Some radar satellites also use Sun-synchronous orbits by flying along the border between day and night (dusk—-dawn orbits) and do not pass over the Earth’s shadow. This makes it possible for their solar generators to be continuously illuminated by the Sun, which is beneficial for the charging of the batteries. ",True,3
What factors influence the spatial resolution in sensor scans?,"However, the required high spatial resolution can only be achieved by limiting the width of the sensor scan, the so-called swath width around the footprint on the ground. Typical swath widths are 20-85 km for land surface observation systems (SPOT, IRS, Landsat) and 10-21 km for systems with object- detection capabilities (IKONOS, QUICKBIRD). By lining up scanned swaths next to each other, one can obtain a complete image of the Earth’s surface within one observation cycle. ",True,3
What term describes the time interval before a ground track is repeated?,"As to the orbit path, for almost complete daily coverage a so-called floating orbit is necessary, which leads to continuous offsetting of subsequent footprints on ensuing overpasses. By contrast, a frozen orbit produces a daily integral repeat pattern. The time interval required for complete coverage of the Earth’s surface is called the repeat cycle and describes the time that passes before a particular ground track is repeated. ",True,3
What factors influence the frequency at which a specific location on Earth can be observed by satellites?,"It should be distinguished from the revisit time, which describes the time before some location on Earth can be sensed again. Since this time is a function of the geographic latitude of the target area and the capabilities of modern satellite systems to rotate up to 60° from their nadir track, the revisit time is always lower than the repeat cycle..

What are the primary components involved in the operation of a sensor system?,7.1.2.3 Sensor Systems,True,2
What is the preferred spatial resolution range for civilian Earth observation satellites?,"For Earth observation, primarily optical sensors and passive and active microwave sensors are used. The goal of the recording system is to achieve as far as possible an image of the Earth with moderate to very high spatial resolution. For both sensor systems the currently preferred resolution range for civilian Earth observation satellites is between 5 and 30 m for large- area monitoring (Landsat, SPOT, ERS, ENVISAT, RADARSAT-1), as well as the range between 0.5 and.

What are the two types of sensing modes commonly offered by imaging sensors?,"3m for detailed imaging (QUICKBIRD, IKONOS, TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2). Typically, both types of sensors offer different sensing modes. These can produce either a continuous, “strip map” or a selec- tive, scene-oriented recording. For the latter, a “look and stare” or “spotlight” mode is frequently used, in which the sensor limits its scan onto the target area by mechanical or electronic means in order to obtain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.. ",True,2
How do radar sensors differ from optical sensors in measuring Earth's topography?,"Both optical and microwave sensors provide technical means for measuring the topography of the Earth. Whereas optical sensors follow the classic stereo method of using fore- and aft-looking cameras or different satellite passes for sensing from different observation positions, radar sensors primarily use interferometric methods with two receivers at dif- ferent locations or with two overpasses of the same receiver in a multipass procedure.. ",True,3
How many spectral bands do multispectral scanners typically use?,Optical Sensor SystemsThe classic optical multispectral recording processes use either mechanical scanning (Landsat) or elec- tronic line scanners with one to five rows (MOMS). Multispectral scanners usually employ 4-7 spectral bands in the visual and thermal wavelength range (Landsat 7) selected according to the desired applica- tion (Table 7.1.1).,True,3
What type of sensor is commonly used to enhance multispectral imagery?,"Frequently, a panchromatic sensor (0.45-0.90 jum) with significantly higher geometric resolution is added to sharpen the multispectral image (IKONOS, SPOT). For modern optical systems the radiometric resolution is 10-12 bits and permits object recognition even in shaded areas.

What is the typical number of spectral bands for hyperspectral resolution in optical sensing systems?,"Optical sensing systems (Figure 7.1.6) with very high, so-called hyperspectral resolution of 200 or more spectral bands have so far only been employed to monitor the atmosphere (GOME, TOMS, SCIA- MACHY). As they are used primarily to measure the concentration of trace gases in the atmosphere, their moderate geometric resolution (40-200 km) is ade- quate. The value of this type of sensor for land surface or ocean applications is, however, evident. Progress in technical developments will soon support their application in spaceborne systems (EnMAP)..

What are the spectral ranges for reflective and emissive infrared sensors mentioned?,Infrared sensors are being integrated in mul- tispectral and hyperspectral instruments. The spec- tral ranges of reflective (3.7-5.4 um) and emissive (12.3-15.4 ym) infrared are of particular interest. The TM on Landsat 4/5 was equipped with spectral channels in these infrared ranges and the planned sensor suite for the hyperspectral EnMAP satellite will likewise be equipped with several channels in the infrared range. ,True,3
What type of disasters can infrared sensors help to identify?,"Another special application of infrared sensors is recognizing hotspots like forest and bush fires, volcanic eruptions and disasters at technical facilities (Chernobyl).

What advantage do microwave sensors have over optical systems during cloudy conditions?,"In contrast to optical systems, microwave sensors do not require solar illumination of the target and can take measurements through clouds. They are accordingly preferred for monitoring areas of the Earth which are cloud covered (as in the tropics) or do not receive sunlight (polar regions) for a high proportion of the year. Because of the need to send out their own illumination signal to the target area, active radar sensors using an SAR approach are technically more elaborate than optical sensors, and are thus usually limited to one radar frequency range. ",True,3
What missions originally planned satellite formations utilizing different frequency range radar sensors?,"This disadvantage is partially compensated by the multiple polarization capability which is increasingly being used in new sensors, as well as in formation flights of satellites bearing radar sensors of different frequency ranges. Such formations were originally planned for the TerraSAR-X (Figure 7.1.7) and TanDEM-X mis- sions and will presumably be realized with the Italian X-band mission COSMO-SkyMed and the Argentine L-band mission SAOCOM. ",True,3
What frequency range is primarily used for high-resolution object detection in radar applications?,"Because of the different absorptive characteristics of the microwave radiation, the frequency ranges of L-band (2 GHz; TerraSAR-L, SAOCOM) for vegetation monitoring applications, C-band (5 GHz; ERS, RADARSAT, ENVISAT) for ice and ocean monitoring, and X-band (9 GHz; Ter- raSAR-X, COSMO) for purposes of high-resolution object detection are preferred. Radar sensors usually employ active array antennas with a large number (384 modules in the case of TerraSAR-X) of transmit and receive modules as emitters, or concentrating reflector dishes..

What is the function of on-board data processing systems in aerospace applications?,7.1.2.4 On-board Data Handling,True,4
What challenges do high data rates from new Earth observation sensors pose in terms of transmission capabilities?,"Modern Earth observation sensors generate data at rates and volumes which place extremely high demands on handling and transmission of the data to ground. Peak data rates of several gigabits per second are no exception for modern Earth observation sensors and cannot as such be transmitted directly to ground, since the required transmission bandwidth is not available due to international regulations. ",True,3
What is the maximum data rate for satellite data transmission in the dedicated frequency range?,"Compression of the raw sensor data and interim storage in so-called solid- state mass memories (SSMMs) on-board the satellite are therefore essential. Frequently, data processing also includes encryption for the purpose of security from unauthorized access. The transmission of data from satellite to ground takes place in the dedicated transmission band (X-band, 8.025—8.4 GHz) at the current maximum data rate of 320 Mbit/s. ",True,3
What new technologies are anticipated for future Earth observation satellite data transmission?,"The availa- ble bandwidth is sufficient for data transmission from most Earth observation satellites today. Future systems will, however, require new transmission technologies, such as bandwidth-optimized modulation schemes, multiple polarizations, a switchover to new transmis- sion bands, and the transfer of data via geostationary communications satellites at very high-frequency transmission (Ka-)bands or via optical transmission links (e.g. Laser Communication Terminal)..

What is the expected future growth factor for data transmission rates?,"These are frequently several orders of magnitude larger than is the case for the mission operations. Transmission rates of several hundred megabits per second are today the state of the art and will grow in future by another factor of 10. This is the reason for differences in the technical design of the payload ground segment, which is oriented toward the provision of user services, data sets and information products. ",True,2
What plays a critical role in the emergence of novel physical insights from extensive data sets?,"These functions and services are making data access in near real time increasingly possible and have the goal of generating input products for geophysical and Earth-related ana- lyses. Another consideration is that in many cases new physical insights can only arise from completely new reprocessing of data sets which incorporate long time intervals of monitoring. The most obvious example is the discovery of the ozone hole over the south polar atmosphere, which, although detected in the first data from the CCSZ sensor on-board the Nimbus satellites, was only recognized after complete reprocessing of the data with new algorithms..

What factors are essential for effective use of satellite-supported Earth observation activities?,"The establishment of a payload ground segment is a significant step in realizing an Earth observation capacity, since timely data availability and long-time continuity of data archiving are primary preconditions for exploiting satellite-supported Earth observation activities.

How frequently do the satellites rotate around their axis to ensure optimal solar energy reception?,"These satellites have their antennas oriented tow- ard the Earth while they are orbiting, but their solar panels always need to be oriented perpendicular to the Sun in order to receive the maximal amount of solar energy (see Figure 7.2.2). For this purpose they are mounted on the z-axis so that they can rotate around their axis once a day relative to the body of the satellite (the satellite’s z-axis is parallel to the Earth’s axis). The electrical power generated is transferred to the satellite body via slip-ring bearing and the power transfer assembly (BAPTA).. ",True,2
What is the required alignment precision for antennas directed towards the target area?,The antennas have to be aligned with the target area with a precision of 0.1° (and in the future the precision specification will be even more stringent as antenna sizes and particularly frequencies increase).7.2.2.1 MOLNIYA Satellites and Orbits,True,2
What is the inclination angle of the MOLNIYA satellites' orbits in degrees?,"The exception to the rule that commercially successful satellite systems fly in GEO are the Russian MOLNIYA satellites. In order to serve this massive country, at least three GEO satellites are required (with only two, the north-central region would lack coverage). The highly elliptically orbiting MOLNIYA satellites (they bear the same name as their orbits and the rockets used to launch them) fly in a relatively stable orbit inclined 63.43° relative to the equatorial plane. ",True,3
What unique orbital characteristics allow satellites to maintain prolonged coverage over Russia in MOLNIYA orbits?,"The MOLNIYA orbits are so designed that the satellites stay over Russia for a long time (apogee), with only a short flight over the South Pole (perigee).

What are the specific characteristics of low-orbit spacecraft that differentiate them from those in higher orbits?,7.2.3 Low-Orbit Spacecraft,True,3
What factors made early commercial use of satellites in low Earth orbit impractical?,"Satellites flying in low Earth orbit (LEO) were never used commercially, even in the early days of space technology. The reasons are that a large number of satellites are needed to achieve geographical coverage, and at each ground station two to three antennas are necessary to provide uninterrupted service (one antenna tracks the descending satellite, e.g., in the west; the second looks toward the ascending satellite in the east, while a third is “scanning” the sky for a more sui- table satellite, possibly at a higher altitude, less blocked by buildings or with more free capacity).. ",True,3
What technology did Harold Rosen develop to enable the launch of satellites into geostationary orbit with LEO rockets?,"The supposition that launch into low Earth orbit is less expensive is a fallacy. Placing satellites into orbit at the geostationary altitude of 36 000 km above the equator has not been an obstacle ever since Harold Rosen of the Hughes Aircraft Company, USA, developed the apogee kick motor (AKM) and the associated launch procedure in 1965 and successfully demonstrated them with Intelsat 1. With the AKM it is possible to put satellites into GEO with rockets limited to LEO. ",True,2
What propulsion system is noted for its efficiency in reaching GEO altitude?,"The satellite’s internal propulsion system, even today, remains the most efficient method of taking a satellite to GEO altitude. It competes with transport via GEO-capable rockets, which have the substantial disadvantage that they themselves remain in the geostationary orbit where they could collide with satellites.. ",True,3
What type of orbits do Earth observation satellites typically utilize to improve image resolution?,"Whereas communications satellites fly as high as possible, preferably in geostationary orbits, so that they can serve the largest possible region (42.6% of the Earth), Earth observation and reconnaissance satellites fly in low orbits to maximize the resolution of their imagery. An exception to this rule was proposed during the Cold War as an answer to the question of how to make a (military) satellite invulnerable. One single satellite cannot be made invulnerable, but many satellites can be launched and operated so that it is. ",True,3

What was the maximum number of satellites proposed before 1990 in the Star Wars/Brilliant Pebbles initiative?,"This idea led to the concept of hundreds of low-flying satellites (the Star Wars/Brilliant Pebbles program). After 1990, the number of satellites was reduced to only 77, later to 66, still a large number, particularly since the requirement of invincibility of the fleet was no longer a systems requirement.",True,1
What orbit was defined by INMARSAT for multiple communications systems?,"Nevertheless, the Iridium, Globalstar and Orb- Comm communications systems were realized. They joined the intermediate altitude circular orbit (ICO) defined by INMARSAT. All four companies predic- tably went bankrupt in 2000, from which Iridium, Globalstar and OrbComm recovered with the help of US government contracts. The commercial success of low-flying communications satellites has not been proven to date.. ",True,2
What is the altitude of the orbit for the low-flying Iridium satellites?,"Figure 7.2.3 shows the footprints of the Iridium satellite constellation of low-flying satellites. Iridium flies in a polar orbit at an altitude of 790 km and has its highest satellite density at the Earth’s poles. Over the world’s most heavily populated areas at about 45°N latitude, only a single satellite is in view (whose failure leads to service outage).",True,1
What is the altitude at which the Globalstar satellites operate?,"Figure 7.2.4 shows the footprints of the Globalstar constellation of orbiting satellites. In contrast to Iridi- um, the Globalstar satellites fly at 1414 km altitude in inclined orbits and have their highest concentration over the latitudes of the Earth’s population. Here up to four satellites are in view, so that the failure of any one of them will not interrupt service.",True,2
What percentage of launch costs into geostationary orbits occurs within the initial 10 kilometers?,The advantages and disadvantages of satellites in GEO and LEO are summarized below based on various considerations.Launch Cost: About 50% of the cost of launch into GEO arises during the first 10 km. The higher unit cost for a GEO is outweighed by the large number of satellites necessary in LEO. Low orbits have no advantage over geostationary orbits as to their energy balance.,True,3
What is the relationship between signal power received on Earth and the altitude of transmission?,"Transmit Power: Recalling the law of the conser- vation of energy, the power received on the Earth’s surface is independent of the flight altitude from which it is transmitted.

What impact does cell size have on the efficiency of frequency spectrum usage?,"Frequency Utilization: The efficient use of the limited frequency spectrum leads to the use of indi- vidual cells on the ground, where a frequency band can be reused in every other cell; so the smaller the cells, the higher the exploitation of the spectrum. The cells projected on the Earth’s surface from the geostationary Inmarsat 4 satellite are as small as those of low-flying Globalstar, so the low orbiters have no systems advantage here, either..

What disadvantage do low orbiting satellites present for broadcasting services due to user antenna requirements?,"a communication signal to travel to the satellite and back, system latency has often been listed as an ad- vantage of the low orbiters. This argument was not always correct either. For satellites having on-board signal processing, there can be latencies as high as the time required for the signal to reach GEO because of the processing time. For broadcasting services (television) low orbiting satellites are totally inappropriate because the users’ antennas would have to track those satellites 24 hours a day.. ",True,3
What is the operational characteristic of satellites used for Earth observation regarding their flight frequency over target areas?,"In the case of other services, particularly Earth observation and reconnaissance, only a small number of ground stations are operated and it is desirable to fly as low as possible.

How does satellite altitude affect the minimum elevation requirement for satellite launches?,Number of satellites —number of satellites have to be launched and operated. Figure 7.2.5 shows the number of satellites required for a given minimum elevation between the user and the satellite as a function of the altitude of the satellite (see also Section 2.2).,True,3
What is the minimum altitude for satellite observation as mentioned in the figure?,"The Figure illustrates, for example, the case when a satellite flies at an altitude of only 700 km with a user requiring a minimum elevation angle of at least 40° so that there is a good chance of seeing the satellite also in urban environments. This leads to a requirement for 840 satellites, the original TeleDesic system, which could not be financed.",True,3
What altitude range is generally considered reasonable for Low Earth Orbits?,"The horizontal bars in Figure 7.2.5 represent the inner and outer Van Allen radiation belts, which should be avoided for technical reasons related to on-board electronic equipment.

What was the proposed solution to reduce satellite numbers in LEO systems by ICO Inc. and TRW Corp.?,The need to reduce the large number of satellites required for the LEO systems led to the proposal of systems with constellations in ICOs proposed by ICO Inc. and TRW Corp.

How many satellites are required for global coverage with three orbital planes?,"for LEO constellations). With two orbital planes of five satellites each, or three planes with three satellites each, global coverage is achieved, including the Earth’s poles.

Why is a second antenna required for user terminals during satellite tracking?,"But as in the case of the LEO, the user antennas, instead of remaining stationary, have to constantly track the orbiting satellites, with the additional expense of a second antenna per terminal pointed toward the ascending satellite while the first one operates with the descending satellite, for (almost) uninterrupted service.",True,2

With 18 satellites at least three would always be in sight, so that triangulation could be carried out to determine position.",True,1
What challenges do communication systems in MEO face regarding ground station requirements?,"There are no known projects for communication systems in MEO.

What types of services have utilized highly inclined elliptical orbits?,"7 Utilization of Space7.2.6 Satellites in Highly Inclined OrbitsThe highly inclined elliptical orbits (HEOs) (often incorrectly interpreted as highly elliptical orbits) are in principle suitable for communications, the most well-known examples being the MOLNIYAs mentioned above for telephony and data (Russia, since 1965) and the SIRIUS system for radio/music (USA, since 2000).",True,2
What capability does a high inclination orbit provide regarding Earth's coverage areas?,"The high inclination permits coverage of regions in the high north (see Figure 7.2.6); in culmination, MOLNIYA sees not only the North Pole, but also the other side of the Earth down to New York.",True,3
What inclination angle ensures a stable orbit with minimal operational adjustments?,"The 63.43° inclination guarantees a stable orbit with minimal requirements for operational adjust- ment. With a 24-hour orbit, two satellites equally distributed in orbit are sufficient for one of them to always be over the target area.",True,3
What benefits do global constellations bring to communication services?,"HEOs can be operated for any orbital period. With a 12-hour orbit, two northern culminations would be achieved.

What is the duration of one orbit in an inclined geosynchronous orbit?,"7.2.7 Satellites in Inclined, Geostationary OrbitsAn orbit only conditionally suitable but nevertheless very promising for communications is the inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO).Geosynchronicity means that in IGSO the duration of one orbit is 23 hours, 54 minutes and 6 seconds (the sidereal day) so that the satellite always remains at the same longitude.",True,2
What describes the motion of a satellite in an inclined geostationary orbit?,Inclination refers to the fact that the IGSO orbital plane is inclined with respect to the equatorial plane; over the course of a day a satellite in this rotating inclined orbital plane travels north-south relative to the Earth (just as someone on a rotating tipped ride at an amusement park goes up and down relative to the solid ground).,True,2
How much does the inclination of a satellite's orbit in geostationary orbit increase annually due to lunar attraction?,"The length of the north-south movement amounts to twice the value of the inclination. IGSOs with a slight inclination are a common occurrence in geo- stationary Earth orbits: the asymmetrical attraction of the Moon relative to the equatorial plane, which affects a satellite in geostationary orbit, shifts its orbit from the horizontal plane and inclines it by 0.8° per year while maintaining the orbital period.. ",True,2
What maximum angle of inclination would the satellite reach if not corrected?,"Uncorrected, the satellite would gradually incre- ase its inclination up to a maximum of 17.5°. At this inclination the satellite would see the Earth’s poles once daily, long enough for a communication link with research stations there.",True,2
What latitude must satellites achieve for northern region coverage at large angles?,"To cover northern regions at large angles of inci- dence, IGSOs have to achieve higher inclinations; the satellites are then not launched from equatorial bases (such as Kourou, less than 5° latitude) but rather from northern sites (such as Plesetsk, at about 63.43°N).",True,3
What geometry allows satellites in IGSO over Europe to maintain a near vertical elevation angle for communications?,"With three or more satellites in IGSO, one of them is always in the northern culmination. If the longitude of the IGSO is in Europe, the satellites fly over Central Europe and provide users there with an almost vertical elevation angle, in contrast to an elevation angle under 30° which Central Europeans have with a GEO. This is an important precondition for communications in general, especially in urban environments.. ",True,3
What was a primary concern regarding the placement of a European IGSO over the USA?,"These advantageous elevation angles and the regional attribute of IGSO led to the selection of IGSO in the original Galileo system planning, with the goal of beginning the system implementation in Europe. A European IGSO would not have flown over the USA; there were fears that the USA would not tolerate a foreign competitive system. Also, European coverage was considered preferable to worldwide expansion, especially for mobile land applications in Europe, which account for over 90% of the utili- zation of a satellite positioning system.. ",True,2
What was the purpose of extending Europe’s Galileo to include regions like the Americas and Asia?,"The extension of Europe’s Galileo to achieve inter- national coverage with IGSOs over the Americas and Asia was intended, should these regions join the system and participate financially. In this way a global system could have been built up step by step, with international cooperation and participation, including especially the USA.",True,3

Nonetheless, MEO technology was selected for Galileo for political reasons, so the system is not sovereign; it can be degraded or turned off by the USA whenever and wherever it considers this to be necessary, with the explicit permission of the EU.",True,2
What is a significant advantage of IGSO regarding frequency spectrum in comparison to GEO?,"The value of IGSO for communications is in the high elevation angles, in northern regions as well, which permits communication also in urban high-rise environments with no visibility to GEO satellites. Even more relevant is the characteristic of IGSO to be able to reuse the frequency spectrum employed in GEO without causing mutual interference. The frequencies used there can be reused in the northern culmination and once again in the southern IGSO culmination, a tripling of the usable spectrum; the orbital commu- nications capacity is tripled with IGSO.. ",True,3
What is the main limitation in deploying additional geostationary satellites?,This characteristic outweighs all other points of view. The available spectrum in GEO is so extensively used today that it is almost impossible to obtain licen- ses for and operate any more geostationary satellites to supply the Earth’s highly populated areas.,True,2
How many commercial communications satellites are currently in operation or licensed in GEO?,"There are presently about 500 commercial commu- nications satellites in GEO in active operation or with legal licenses to operate. In addition, there are military communications satellites and satellites providing weather services, used for civilian Earth observation or employed in military reconnaissance.",True,1
What is the relationship between data rates and the size of ground antennas for satellite transmissions?,"For higher data rates, Internet downloads and broadband video from unmanned flight drones, all of which are transmitted to the control centers via geostationary satellites, larger ground antennas are required.",True,3
What is the primary method of signal transfer for satellites operating at IGSO longitude points?,"Compared to GEO satellites, satellites in IGSO have to operate with ground antennas which are either small enough for the satellite to be in the antenna’s main beam, or have larger apertures, which must be dynamically tracked. However, in the latter case a single antenna is sufficient for each ground terminal (in contrast to the three antennas required for LEOs). Since the ascending and descending satellites are at the same longitude, they meet at the point of signal transfer and a simple handover at this location is possible.. ",True,3

What is the relationship between directivity and antenna gain for phased array antennas compared to parabolic dishes?,"The directivity and thus the antenna gain, which are important for the transmission, are identical for phased array antennas of the same size as parabolic dishes operating at the same frequency. Since the pha- sed array antenna consists of semiconductor elements, it has the potential for significant cost reductions when produced in sufficient quantities.7.2.8 Polar Orbiting Satellites",True,3
What characteristic of polar Earth orbits allows satellites to maintain consistent Sun angles after several orbits?,"Satellites in orbits crossing over the poles are suitable for Earth observation, not because of their view of the poles, but because polar Earth orbits (PEOs) can be so designed that after a few orbits the satellite repeats its track; it flies with the same Sun angle so that new image material can be compared with previously recorded images without misleading shadows.",True,3
Why are polar orbits considered economically undesirable for telecommunications services?,"For communication services (stationary or mobile telecommunications and television), polar Earth orbits are unsuitable and economically undesirable because they produce the highest satellite density (and thus systems costs) at the poles where there are no custo- mers. In contrast the satellite density is relative low, where the higher user density (population density) is located on the Earth’s surface.. ",True,2

The radiofrequency regulations today provide frequency allocations for communication with high-altitude platforms (HAPs).",True,2
What characteristic prevents balloons from remaining stationary in high-altitude environments compared to aircraft and zeppelins?,"Aircraft and zeppelins are used as high-altitude platforms, less so balloons, which, unlike aircraft and zeppelins, cannot be maintained in a stationary2/24/09 2:38:58 PM 7.2, Communicationsposition against the forces of the jet streams which dominate the upper atmosphere.",True,2
What aspect of aircraft allows them to maintain stability against high-altitude winds?,"The advantage of aircraft is their ability to easily maintain their position against jet streams, an essential precondition for communications services. In addi- tion, they can be brought back down regularly and at short notice for servicing and refueling.",True,2
What enables zeppelins to maintain altitude without the need for fuel?,"The advantage of zeppelins is that they can main- tain altitude without fuel, but they too have to resist the jet streams. The use of fuel is almost impossible for this purpose, since it would be too costly to bring it up to the vehicle, or to bring the zeppelin back down to Earth for refueling.",True,1
What technological advancement could enable a zeppelin to sustain its position at night using solar energy?,"Perhaps there will be, one day, affordable batteries to store enough electrical power during sunshine to maintain the zeppelin’s position during nighttime.",True,1
What altitude is required to cover an area equivalent to Germany?,"To cover an area the size of Germany, an altitude of about 20 000 m, which is above the airspace used by aircraft, is necessary and adequate. For the coverage of larger regions a fleet of several zeppelins would have to be in operation simultaneously.",True,2
What is necessary for high bit rate communication with fixed ground antennas?,"In any case, an HAP in the stratosphere would have to precisely maintain its position also during the night, to allow communication at high bit rates, and thus with large, fixed, directive, nontracking ground antennas.",True,2
"What types of communications are primarily associated with HAPs, according to preconditions?","If these preconditions are met, then HAPs are platforms of choice for communications, which are primarily regional (one calls more often someone in the same county than someone on the other side of the globe). Precisely this user profile can be well served with HAPs, which would free satellites from this service.7.2.10 Telecommunication Services: Little-Big—Mega",True,2

What is the primary reason that UHF frequency bands are not suitable for voice traffic?,"Even when the satellites deposit the message data immediately after identifying the address, transmis- sion is not synchronous, so it is not suitable for voice traffic but only for data. In addition, the frequency bands used in the UHF range are so overloaded by various services that it can take up to 15 minutes before the user terminal can deposit a message; there is no real-time capability.",True,3
What types of satellite systems allow small data transfers inexpensively and reliably?,"Besides the little LEOs for the little services, small amounts of data can also be transferred via geostati- onary satellite systems like EUTELSAT (EutelTracks, in the Ku-band) and via INMARSAT (Standard C and Standard D, in L-band) inexpensively, reliably and without delays.",True,2
What is the primary distinction between big services and little services regarding transmission rates?,"7.2.10.2 Big ServicesThis type of service differs from the little services in the bit rate; big services (big LEO services) can also transmit voice and data at ISDN speed.

What was the initial number of satellites planned for the communication system before the reduction?,"TeleDesic promised the user transmission rates of up to 1.5 Gbit/s. For this purpose, 840 satellites, later reduced to “only” 288, were to fly in circular LEOs.

What is the function of a device that converts and amplifies frequency bands for transmission back to Earth?,"Typical transmission bandwidths are 1 GHz (500 MHz in each of the two polarizations; 4.2 GHz in the case of ASTRA), not reflected in an extremely wide band, but subdivided into frequency units of, for example, 40 MHz, which are processed separately. The repe- ater, which converts a 40 MHz band unit into the desired frequency and transmits it amplified back to Earth, is called a transponder (it transposes the frequency it receives to the transmit frequency).. ",True,2
Why are only parts of the total bandwidth used in transponders despite advancements in transmit power?,"This subdividing of the actively used spectrum in transponders was necessary in the early days of satellite technology because the transmit power which would be necessary to emit the entire bandwidth was not technically available. Even today, when this satellite transmit power is technically available, transponders taking up only part of a bandwidth are used because they can flexibly serve individual antennas for given coverage zones (something that would not be possible for an en bloc converter).

What is the simplest way to alter a transponder's transmit power during flight?,"If one desires to change the transmit power of a transponder during flight without modifying the power output of the transmitter amplifier, the easiest method is to provide additional amplifiers: transpon- ders which potentially have requirements for higher power are connected to additional amplifiers (parallel connection). This can be accomplished in orbit from the ground as required.",True,3
What was the primary limitation of the 6 W amplifiers used in Intelsat I during 1964?,"Paralleling of transmit amplifiers goes back to the first communications satellites Intelsat I and Intelsat II.

What is the benefit of using parallel connections of amplifiers in satellites?,"The manufacturer of these satellites continued to produce parallel connections of amplifiers in the satellites up until today — a small expense with great benefits because, should amplifiers fail on the satellite, the amplifiers intended for the parallel connection could be used to maintain operation. A transponder with only one amplifier is more useful than a trans- ponder without an amplifier.",True,2
What configurations can be employed in amplifiers to achieve adjustable transponder transmit power?,"7.2.11.2 Multimode TubesThe second possibility to achieve variable transponder transmit power is to construct the amplifier so that it can be operated in two or three different output stages. While any amplifier can be operated with low output power by starting with low input power, it will require for such operation the same power supply it would require if operated to full capacity.",True,3

What operational changes in transponder bandwidth can be achieved using digital filters in space missions?,"With the use of digital bandpass filters it is possible to change the transponder bandwidth in orbit during mission operation. In the ideal situation where all 40 MHz transponders are equally used to capacity, it is not used in practice. There always are, however, transponders which are not used to capacity and others for which there is more traffic than they can transport.",True,3
How does adjustable bandwidth in transponders affect traffic load management?,"With transponders whose bandwidth can be chan- ged in orbit, the actual traffic load can be matched.

What methods can supply extra power to a transponder with increased bandwidth?,"The additional power required by a transponder whose bandwidth was increased can be supplied by transmit amplifiers connected in parallel, or by using multimode amplifiers.

What is the primary reason for using multiple cells in satellite communications?,"As in cell telephony on the ground, several individual cells are used in satellite communications instead of one conglomerate illumination for the entire co- verage area.

This frequency reuse is absolu- tely required to accommodate continually increasing communications traffic in a physically limited, not increasing frequency spectrum.. ",True,2
"What is the increase in usable frequency band when n cells operate, given one-third bandwidth allocation per cell?","If one-third of the entire bandwidth is allocated to each cell in a honeycomb structure and n cells are operated, then the net usable frequency band increases by a factor of n/3.

In conventional technologies this require- ment would lead to the installation of n° transponders (for each connection two transponders are required, one from A to B and one from B back to A).. ",True,3
How many transponders would be needed for 200 cells?,"For example, in the case of n= 200 cells, this would require the installation and operation of n° = 40 000 transponders, which is practically impossible. Instead, one employs a processor in the payload, the on-board processor (OBP), which takes over this switching function (on-board switching, OBS).",True,1
What must the processor do when controlling the switch on-board to read the desired address?,"The control of the switch can take place either on-board or on the ground (the ground network controlling commands the on-board processor). In the first case, the processor must demodulate the signal in order to be able to read the desired address in its baseband. This is technically possible today and",True,2
How does the direct forwarding of signals to recipients differ from the process involving ground control and satellites?,"7 Utilization of Spacesaves time and transmission capacity; the signal can be forwarded directly to the addressee, whereas with ground control the signal has to travel from the sender via the satellite to the ground station and after the switching then back via satellite to the addressee.",True,4
What advantage does on-board demodulation provide for signal errors encountered during the uplink in satellite communication?,"Demodulation of the signal in the satellite has the additional advantage that signal errors incurred on the uplink can be corrected on-board, so that the signal emitted on the downlink is “like new,” free of errors.",True,3
What modulation improvement is used in satellites to enhance downlink performance?,"The signal can also undergo another modulation in the satellite to optimize it for the downlink, something quite common in military spacecraft.In addition to the dramatic advantage of the on-board processor of not having to install, say, 40 000 transponders, the operation of this processor has systems benefits.",True,3
What happens to the bandwidth and power of an inactive ground cell in a transponder system?,"When a ground cell in a transponder architecture has little traffic or remains altogether unused, neither its bandwidth nor its power can be transferred to another cell (another transponder) which might be overloaded and must reject additional traffic.",True,2
How does the on-board switching manage traffic across multiple cells?,"By contrast, the on-board switching handles all traffic, no matter how heterogeneously distributed over the cells, flexibly assigning bandwidth and power to cells needing it, in real time and without rejecting any traffic.7.2.11.8 Payloads with Multiple Frequency Bands",True,2
Identify the frequency bands commonly utilized for commercial broadcasting and telecommunications.,"Of the frequency bands listed in Section 6.4.2 allocated to satellite communications, the P-, L, S-, C-, X-, Ku-, Ka-, Q-, V- and W-bands, current national communi- cations satellites commonly use four, namely the C-, Ku- and Ka-bands, in commercial communication: the Ku-band for broadcasting, the X- and Ka-bands for military telecommunications, and the L- and S-bands for mobile communications.",True,3
What is the purpose of cross-strappings between frequency bands in payload communication?,"Cross-connections between these bands (cross- strappings) in the payload usually assure technical flexibility.

What types of modulation procedures are preferred for satellite communications?,"Satellite communications use the same modulation procedures as do terrestrial communications, prefe- rably phase shift keying modulation with 4 (QPSK) and 16 (APSK) phase states.",True,2
What is the required bandwidth for transmitting 1 Mbyte/s using 16APSK modulation?,"The QPSK modulation (M= 4 with 2 bits/symbol) requires 0.8 Hz/bit of bandwidth: that is, 1 Mbyte/s requires 0.8 MHz bandwidth; the 16APSK procedure (M = 16 with 4 bits/symbol) requires 0.4 MHz per 1 Mbyte/s, including rate 3/4 trellis coding and a guard band between carriers. The state of the art is that modulation equipment adjusts the degree of modulation to the quality of the channel in the course of transmission (DVB-S2 Standard, Self-Adjusting Modulation Techniques). ",True,3
What modulation technique is used by the modem when channel quality is optimal?,"As long as the transmission channel maintains nominal quality, the modems modulate 16APSK; if channel quality breaks, for ex- ample because of the weather, the modem reduces the degree of modulation, such as to QPSK. This makes the transmission twice as robust, although only half as fast, but it is better to have error-free transmission than rapid but faulty transmission.. ",True,3
How does an adaptive code rate affect transmission speed in satellite communications?,"Also for channel coding, equipment with adaptive code rates is used today in satellite communications, as it has been used terrestrially since the 1970s. If the channel degrades and the bit error rate increases, the coder/decoder reduces the code rate from, for example, 3/4 (every fourth bit is a code bit) to 1/2 (every second bit is a code bit). In this way the error rate is reduced at the cost of a slower transmission.. ",True,2
What technique allows temporary reduction of carrier load in satellite transmissions for improved signal quality?,"The third way to maintain transmission despite difficult channel conditions, next to reducing the modulation and increasing the coding, is to reduce the carrier load in the satellite transponder (load dumping). If the situation requires it, a few carriers will be temporarily offloaded and their power assigned to the remaining carriers in the transponder so that they, now equipped with higher transmit power, have a better chance of maintaining nominal quality (threat adaptive offloading).. ",True,3
What technique can enhance error protection by utilizing the freed bandwidth from offloading?,"One could also use the bandwidth freed by offloa- ding for increased channel coding of the remaining carriers, thus making them even more robust, and thereby achieve additional error protection.7.2.13 Multiple Access Techniques",True,3
What method allows multiple users to share a communications satellite's resources simultaneously using different frequencies?,"How can many users gain access to a single resource, the communications satellite? An obvious answer is: one after the other (successive multiple access, called time division multiple access (TDMA)). But users could also work with different frequencies at the same time, in the same way that radio stations transmit on their own individual frequencies (multiple access by subdividing a frequency range, called frequency division multiple access (FDMA)). ",True,3
What technology allows multiple transmissions to coexist on a single frequency by using distinct coding?,"A third option is to individually code multiple transmissions so that they can be superimposed on the same frequency (multiple access via coding, called code division multiple access (CDMA)). Knowing the selected code, the recipient can filter out, from the sum of all signals, the one meant for him or her. CDMA is costly in terms of bandwidth.. ",True,3

Besides the technology available at such frequencies, propagation in the atmosphere is a limiting factor for the highest frequency.",True,1
What happens to signal attenuation at frequencies above 100 GHz in the atmosphere?,"It is interesting to note that propagation in the atmosphere does not become increasingly difficult as frequencies exceed 100 GHz. Attenuation by pre- cipitation more or less stagnates there, so that one can also work in the infrared and visible ranges. The great advantage there is that laser links enable much larger bandwidths, so a far greater volume of data per unit time can be transmitted.

What are the two methods for connecting users in an urban district?,"There are two ways to reach users distributed throughout an urban district or across even larger regions: either with terrestrial networks, in which the gigabit link is received by one anchor station and forwarded terrestrially to the target address, or by using a satellite phased array antenna, which can receive a large number of laser links from distributed stations and then retransmit them. The first phased array antennas in the laser frequency range have already appeared. ",True,2

What has improved in integrated GNSS receivers regarding size and power consumption?,"capability and efficiency of integrated GNSS receivers have substantially increased while the size and power consumption have noticeably decreased. However, the basic operational principle of GNSS receivers remains essentially unchanged. This principle is described using the example of a simplified GPS receiver structure.",True,3
What frequency range do the received signals from the antenna fall into?,The antenna receives L-band (1.2-1.6 GHz) signals. A radiofrequency preamplifier followed by a downconverter stage makes the signals available in baseband.Each GPS satellite is characterized by a specific PRN,True,2
What process is used to correlate the input signal with the reference code in satellite tracking?,"code. The different signals from different satellites can therefore be separated and tracked using a replication of the PRN code, which is stored in the receiver. To this end the input signal is multiplied by the stored code replication. For this process the code replication is shifted along the time axis until the maximum of the correlation function is reached. This time difference is transformed into a ranging value, which is called the pseudo-range. ",True,3
"What type of measurements are combined with satellite navigation message data to derive position, velocity, and time?","The word “pseudo” refers to the fact that it does not reflect the real distance between receivers and satellite, but only a receiver-internal variable. The data of the navigation message (ephemeris and parameter of the satellite clock) is used to compute position, velocity and time, in combination with at least three additional pseudo-range measurements. With the navigation message data and at least four pseudo- ranges it is possible to derive three position coordinates and the time. Figure 7.3.4 shows the respective signal flow within a receiver..

What type of measurement achieves relative accuracy below 5 cm using L-band carrier phase?,"For applications requiring the highest preci- sion a class of receivers has been developed which in addition to the code phase measurements also utilizes L-band carrier phase measurements. Due to the short wavelength of about 20 cm it is possible to achieve a relative accuracy of better than 5 cm, which is known as the carrier phase measurement or RTK measurement. For this type of measurement the error sources (such as orbit error, clock error, etc.) must be cancelled by differential correction technique and the phase ambiguity must be resolved.. ",True,4

What is the maximum duration for which satellite orbit and time parameters can deviate from estimations due to aging?,"Since both the satellite orbits and the satellite time are described by parameters in the navigation mes- sage and these parameters can “age” up to 12 hours, the actual track and clock data deviates from the estimations.",True,3
What technique is used to minimize errors in satellite positioning?,"This error can be substantially reduced by so-called differential correction. At accurately aligned reference points, the deviations being produced are determined and transmitted to the user, for example by means of portable radio or satellite communication. Asa function of the latency of the adjustment data and the distance from the reference station, the satellite error can be reduced to below a few centimeters.. ",True,2
What factors can affect the speed of signals transmitted from satellites to ground receivers?,7.3.7.2 Signal Propagation ErrorThe propagation velocity of the signals from the satellite to the ground receiver can be altered by the terrestrial atmosphere. A distinction is made between ionosphere- and troposphere-introduced errors.,True,3
What factors can lead to variations in electron concentration within the ionosphere?,"The concentration and distribution of free elec- trons in the ionosphere can vary considerably, for instance due to changes in the solar wind. These fluc- tuations can sometimes occur on small scales where the diameter of local ionospheric turbulence is under 50 km. The runtime fluctuations can cause errors of up to several meters. By using two-frequency recei- vers, the propagation time effects can be modeled in various frequency bands and a significant part of this error can be corrected. Nevertheless, at times of high solar activity substantial limitations on the measuring accuracy can be observed.. ",True,3

"What phenomenon occurs when signals are reflected by nearby objects, causing positioning errors at the receiver?","Signals which did not arrive in the direct line of sight of the receiver but were reflected by the environment of the receiver (e.g., by houses, objects in the vicinity or on the ground) show a deceptive position. This effect is called multipath propagation. Numerous receiver technologies have been developed to suppress this positioning error. For example, the signal shape (changes are caused by rapid phase jumps during reflection), or an evaluation of only the directly received signals and a suppression of delayed signals, can be used to identify and reduce the multipath effect in the receiver.. ",True,2
What are the common types of inaccuracies that can occur during data reception?,7.3.7.3 Receiver Errors,True,3
What is the correlation resolution percentage related to the chip rate of the GPS signal?,"Since the satellite signals are extremely weak (107° W), the thermal noise of the receiver substantially limits the proper evaluation of the signal [7.3.3]. Temporal correlation between received signal and stored code replica is possible with a resolution of about 1% of the chip rate of the signal, which corresponds to a GPS C/A code resolution of about 10 ns and/or about 3 m. With the GPS P(Y) code the chip rate is 10 times higher, which reduces this error to about 0.3 m, making it negligible when combined with the other sources of error.. ",True,3

The third column gives the relative velocities at which the target planet is reached, and the last column the transfer time in years.. ",True,3
What is the frequency of favorable launch windows for missions from Earth to Mars?,"Since, as mentioned, start and arrival are 180° apart in the solar orbit, the Earth and the target must be in the correct position to each other at the time of launch. Accordingly, there are only specific launch windows available for such missions. There are good launch possibilities for flights from Earth to Mars every 2.13 years and from Earth to Venus every 1.6 years. (For the sake of completeness one should also mention the possibility of a 540° transfer. ",True,2

What materials are commonly used in multilayer insulation for interplanetary probes?,"High demands are made on the thermal insula- tion of interplanetary probes. Usually, multilayer insulation (MLI) is used. It consists of numerous (typically about 10) layers of reflective plastic foils (e.g., aluminum on kapton), which functions (in a vacuum) similar to a “multiwalled thermos flask.” Under atmospheric conditions (as in the case of Mars or Venus landers), other methods have to be applied, for example aerogels, which have a very low thermal conductivity..

What challenges arise during descent navigation and rebound avoidance in low-gravity environments?,"In the case of the last bodies, a low impact velocity can be chosen because of the low gravitational forces. High-impact energy and landing shock are thus not as problematic as for landings on planets or large moons. On the other hand, the calculation and navigation of the descent as well as the avoidance of any rebound are difficult.",True,3
How do atmospheric density and pressure affect landing methods on extraterrestrial bodies?,"The landing on a body with an atmosphere can be supported by braking with an entry shield and a parachute system. The particular scenario depends on the density and pressure of the atmosphere (the ground pressure on Mars is about 10 mbar, on Venus 90 bar and on Titan 1.6 bar), as well as on its chemical composition and the scale height.",True,4
What is the primary reason for the unfavorable mass-to-payload ratio in spacecraft landing on bodies without atmospheres?,"Landing on large bodies without an atmosphere requires braking rockets, a fact which always leads to an unfavorable ratio between spacecraft mass and payload. This is the case for landing on the Moon, but also, for example, on Mercury or Europa (there have been concrete plans to do so).",True,3
What systems are used to control landings in space probes?,"The landing itself either is controlled and typi- cally carried out on either landing legs (e.g., for Surveyor and Viking) or a landing platform (as for Venera), or involves an airbag system which encases the entire lander when it hits the ground. In the latter case the probe usually has to right itself (as for Luna 9, Mars Pathfinder, MER) after the airbag is released (Figure 7.4.22).",True,3

What distinguishes gravitational mass from inertial mass in the context of a body's motion?,"Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of the Universe. As with the electrostatic Coulomb force, it acts over long distances. Whereas electric fields exert their force only on charged (polarizable) bodies, gravity affects all bodies with mass. It owes its name to the fact that it interacts with the gravitational mass, in contrast to the inertial mass of a body which describes its resistance to the change of motion.. ",True,3
What factor explains the sensation of weightlessness experienced by astronauts aboard the ISS?,"That gravity acts over long distances has the consequence that Earth’s gravitational field extends far into space. The force of Earth’s gravity at the altitude of the International Space Station (ISS) is, for example, still about 90% of its value on the surface. So the reason for weightlessness on the ISS is not because there is no gravity field there. The phenomenon of apparent weightlessness has a dy- namic cause and is related to the system of reference from which one observes the movement of other bodies. ",True,4
What type of frame of reference is experienced by an individual in free fall according to classical physics?,"If we were in an elevator whose support cables had broken, putting us in free fall, we could, assuming we were cool-minded enough, let some object in our possession drop and note that it was not moving relative to ourselves. For us it would be “weightless.” But someone observing from outside would see that both we and the object were in free fall due to the force of Earth’s gravity. In terms of classical physics, the outside observer is in an inertial frame of reference, whereas we are in an accelerated frame of reference compared to that inertial frame of reference. ",True,3
What is the role of fictitious force of inertia in an accelerated reference frame?,"Newton’s laws of classical mechanics are only true for an inertial frame of reference. For the laws of mechanics also to be valid for an accelerated frame of reference, we must postulate an additional force which cancels the effect of gravity so that our observation of the resting body is in accord with Newton’s laws. This force is called the fictitious force of inertia F; and is oppositely proportional to the acceleration of the frame of reference relative to the inertial frame of reference:. ",True,3
What condition leads to the equation m7 = 0 in a free-falling reference frame?,"With the help of this fictitious force of inertia one can write the equation of motion of a point mass m in an7 Utilization of Spaceaccelerated frame of reference with the coordinates r' as follows:with rthe coordinates of the point mass in the inertial frame of reference.In the example of the free-falling elevator, * =—g and § =~g.

What is the primary critical factor for the force of inertia as mentioned in the provided information?,"Equation 7.5.2 is the basis for describing the phenomenon of weightlessness. It is true for the case of linear acceleration as in the ZARM drop tower in Bremen, for weightlessness during parabolic flight, and for space vehicles orbiting the Earth like the ISS. It should be mentioned that for the force of inertia it is the acceleration and not the velocity which is criti- cal. So the phase of weightlessness during a parabolic flight already begins during the ascending portion of the parabola, and accordingly ZARM recently introduced an upward-catapulted launch instead of a regular drop, thereby doubling the duration of weightlessness..

What is the relationship between centrifugal force and gravitational force for a point mass in circular motion around the Earth?,"In the case of rotational acceleration, the fictitious force of inertia takes the form of centrifugal force.

What is the value of residual gravity at 300 km altitude in the radial direction?,"Considering both Equations 7.5.3 and 7.5.4, it becomes clear that weightlessness can only be valid for a point mass. For an elongated body such as the ISS, these forces are compensated only along a line which approximately corresponds to the trajectory of the center of gravity of the space station (Figures 7.5.1 and 7.5.2).’ If one moves away from the center of gra- vity in a plane perpendicular to the flight direction, compensation is not complete and one experiences a residual force of gravity or “microgravity.” At an altitude of 300 km from the surface of the Earth this residual gravity amounts to about 0.3- 107°g)/m in the radial and 0.1- 10 °go/m in the lateral direction, where g is the value of the acceleration due to gravity on the Earth’s surface (g) = 9.81 m/s”)..

What factors influence the drag of a space vehicle at high altitudes?,"In addition to the effect described above, there are other detrimental influences which inevitably lead to residual gravity.

It is accordingly important when constructing subsystems to keep these disturbances to a minimum. One can also attempt to isolate the experimental payload from the rest of the space vehicle by active damping. This approach is being taken in the ISS with the so-called ARIS system. Finally, one can cope with the unavo- idable remaining disturbances by clever scheduling (“timelining”) so that they do not unnecessarily disrupt the experiments.. ",True,3

"What are the primary forces affecting a solid body at rest, excluding gravity?","First of all, it should be clear that the influence of gravity can be ignored for a solid body at rest, since its inner structure and outer form are primarily influ- enced by Coulomb forces. This is true independent of the form of atomic binding, for example covalent, ionic or metallic. The influence of gravity on gases is expressed, for example, in the barometric altitude formula. However, thermal fluctuations in gases are usually so strong that they conceal the influence of gravity over short distances (and for brief times). ",True,2
Why are liquid materials more affected by gravitational forces compared to solids?,"The liquid state is the most sensitive to gravity influences. This is because, in contrast to a solid, they have a free surface and cannot sustain shear forces. Therefore, most materials science experiments under microgra- vity conditions concentrate on the liquid and (to a lesser extent) gaseous states.. ",True,2
What physical effects are absent in fluids under weightless conditions?,"Under weightless conditions there is neither an up nor a down, neither heaviness nor lightness.

Some of them have already been carried out, others are planned.7.5.2 Critical Phenomena",True,2
What process describes the change of a substance from solid to liquid and vice versa?,"Matter can exist in various aggregate conditions and phases. By changing external thermodynamic variables such as pressure and temperature, one can transform such a system from one phase to another. This process is called a phase transition. Examples are the transition from a solid to a liquid state (melting), from the liquid to the gaseous state (evaporation), from an ordered to an unordered solid state, from a magnetic to a nonmagnetic state, etc. ",True,2
What characterizes a first-order phase transition in terms of thermodynamic variables?,"Ehrenfest classified phase transitions by the discontinuities in the thermodynamic variables which change at a phase transition. For a first-order phase transition it is the thermodynamic variables themselves, for example the density at the solid—liquid phase transition. In second- order phase transitions the variables themselves are continuous but their derivatives diverge. For example, the magnetization of ferromagnetic phase transitions changes continuously (from zero to a finite value), but the susceptibility, y= AM/0H, diverges as a function of temperature. ",True,3
What defines the critical point for a fluid system during a specific type of phase transition?,Second-order phase transitions are characterized by a critical point in phase space. Only when all state variables are at their critical value is it a case of a second-order phase transition. For a fluid system the critical point is defined by the critical temperature T. and the critical density 9.... ,True,3
What is the definition of the critical exponent associated with individual thermodynamic values near a critical point?,"How individual thermodynamic values and their derivatives behave near a critical point can be describedby the so-called critical exponents.

"What theory did K. Wilson confirm the scaling laws within, for which he received the Nobel Prize?","The critical exponents do not just describe the behavior of individual values as they approach the critical point. There are also relationships between the individual critical exponents, so-called scaling laws. K. Wilson received the Nobel Prize in 1982 for confirming these scaling laws in the context of renormalization group theory.",True,3
Why is determining individual critical exponents experimentally significant?,"The value of individual critical exponents is very difficult to calculate by theory. Different theories pro- duce different values. It is also not clear how closely one must approach the critical point for Equation 7.5.8 to be valid, and what influence a finite system size has. Therefore, experimental determination of these exponents is extremely important. Under terrestrial conditions there is a difficulty with fluid systems: whereas the critical temperature can in principle be adjusted as precisely as desired, this is not the case for the density. ",True,3
How does gravity affect the density distribution in a fluid within a container?,"Because of gravity the density at the bottom of the container will always be higher than near the top, and the critical density will only be found in an infinitely thin layer perpendicular to the force of gravity. The volume of fluid at the critical point is therefore minuscule compared to the total volume, and the anticipated critical behavior is masked by the noncritical behavior of the rest of the system.

What is the significance of density stratification in a microgravity environment?,"Here is a role for microgravity, since density stratification does not occur there and the entire volume can thus assume the critical value for density.. ",True,3

What specific conditions are necessary for observing Bose-Einstein condensation based on the described phenomena?,"been proposed that Bose-Einstein condensation be experimentally determined under microgravity con- ditions. This condensation is purely a quantum effect that only occurs with particles obeying Bose statistics* and it means that all subsystems condense in the quantum-mechanical ground state, and, in this way, manifest themselves macroscopically. Bose-Einstein condensation only occurs in the absence of external fields, including gravity, and can therefore be optimally observed under microgravity conditions for systems having mass.. ",True,3
What two factors influence the equilibrium form of liquids in reduced gravity?,"Naturally enough, the behavior of liquids in a reduced gravity field is one of the central topics of materials science research under microgravity conditions. First of all there are questions about the form of equilib- rium in liquid volumes and its stability. Here gravity is in competition with surface tension. While for the latter there is a tendency to minimize surface (relative to volume), leading to curved surfaces, in the volume ofa liquid there is a tendency to minimize its potential energy in the gravity field, leading to the formation of flat surfaces as a response to the flat equipotential lines of terrestrial gravitation.

What type of particles conform to Bose statistics?,"Bose statistics are valid for particles with integer spin and allow several particles to exist in the same quantum state.

How does capillary length relate to energy in a constant gravitational field?,"surface is a compromise between these two conflicting principles and can be calculated using differential geometry.

What condition favors flat surfaces according to system dimensions and gravity?,"g= acceleration due to gravity.If the capillary length is short relative to a typical system’s dimension, then the influence of gravity dominates and one has flat surfaces. If it is large, then the influence of the surface tension is dominant and one has curved surfaces.",True,2
What phenomenon predicts the collapse of a liquid bridge in microgravity when the distance between disks exceeds its diameter?,"An interesting question concerns the stability of various liquid forms. The stability of a liquid bridge suspended between two concentric disks has been a matter of intensive investigation. Under weight- less conditions, namely for infinite capillary length, the theory predicts the collapse of the liquid bridge as soon as its diameter is exceeded by the distance between the separating disks. This so-called Laplace instability can only be studied in its pure form under microgravity.. ",True,3
What phenomenon primarily results from the interaction of thermal gradients and gravitational forces?,"Besides these static effects there are dynamic phe- nomena which are the subject of hydrodynamic investigations under microgravity, including primarily convection. As already mentioned above, buoyancy convection isa result of the interaction of temperature gradients and gravity. Most bodies expand when they are heated; that is, they possess a positive thermal expansion coefficient. The consequence is that warmer liquids in a gravity field rise, whereas colder liquids sink. ",True,3
What determines the geometry of convection cells in a heated liquid system?,"If a liquid is heated from below (as on a stove hotplate), flow or buoyancy convection occurs as soon as a critical value in the temperature gradient is exceeded. The geometry of the convection cell depends on the geometry of the entire system and changes with increasing temperature gradients until there. ",True,2
What dimensionless number is used to describe buoyancy convection in materials science?,2/24/09 2:41:21 PM 7.5 Materials Scienceis a transition to turbulent flow. The characteristic quantity for describing buoyancy convection is the dimensionless Rayleigh number:,True,3
What condition leads to the initiation of convection when the Rayleigh number exceeds a specific threshold?,"where: = thermal coefficient of expansion, VT = temperature gradient, x= temperature conductivity, 7 = viscosity, d= typical system length. In the case of unstable layering, if the Rayleigh number exceeds a critical value Ra,, then convection begins. In the case of stable layering (heating from above) there is no convection. In the case of a radial tempe- rature gradient (perpendicular to the force of gravity), then convection is initiated in all temperature gradients, no matter how small; the critical Rayleigh number is zero for this configuration. ",True,4
How does a change in gravitational acceleration affect the threshold for buoyancy convection initiation?,"Because the Rayleigh number contains the value for the acceleration due to gravity, when it is changed then the threshold for the initiation of buoyancy convection accordingly changes, so the stability range of the instable layering can be considerably increased under microgravity. Convection is a very efficient mechanism for transporting mass and heat in liquids. Only if it is suppressed is it possible to study other, weaker effects which are otherwise masked by the buoyancy convec- tion. ",True,4
What phenomenon arises from the temperature dependence of surface tension rather than density?,"One of these effects is Marangoni convection, which was discovered at the beginning of the twen- tieth century but experienced a renaissance thanks to materials science experiments under weightlessness. In contrast to buoyancy convection it has its origin not in the temperature dependence of density, but in the temperature dependence of surface tension.’ As a rule, surface tension increases as the temperature drops, therefore surfaces tend to arch more at cold locations than warm ones where the capillary length is smaller. ",True,3
What principle requires compensation of flow within a liquid as temperature changes?,"This leads to flow along the surface from warm to cold. Because the mass must be conserved, this flow has to be compensated within the liquid and. ",True,2
What factors can affect the spatial variation of surface tension?,"> Or, more precisely, in the spatial dependence of the surfacetension, which may be due to temperature or concentration gradients along the surface.",True,3
What is the critical condition for studying Marangoni convection without the influence of buoyancy effects?,"convection cells are accordingly formed. Marangoni convection is independent of gravity. Since it has the same appearance as buoyancy convection, it can best be studied when the latter is suppressed by not exceeding the critical Rayleigh number, which can be accomplished by reducing gravity.",True,3
What transport mechanisms are primarily studied in combustion research under microgravity when convection is minimized?,"Besides liquids, other fluid systems have also been investigated under microgravity conditions. A par- ticularly active field is combustion research. In an ordinary flame, but also during the combustion of fuel mixtures in motors, convection is the significant mechanism for mass and heat transport. Diffusion processes also play an important role, and these can only be studied if convection is suppressed. ",True,4
What color is the flame produced by a candle under microgravity conditions?,"It was originally not known whether a flame would also burn under microgravity conditions; that is, whether the diffusion processes are sufficient for supplying the flame with oxygen and removing combustion products such as soot. Indeed, a candle burns under microgravity with a bluish, spherical flame.. ",True,3
What is one key reason for conducting combustion research in microgravity environments?,"Combustion research under microgravity condi- tions is not only undertaken to investigate aspects of basic and applied research to improve efficiencies; the safety aspects of fighting fires in a space vehicle, such as the ISS, also play a role.",True,2

What type of crystal forms in microgravity conditions due to the lack of weight on dust particles?,"So-called plasma crystals are a spectacular result of this research. If one puts an electric charge on dust particles in a plasma at sufficiently low tem- perature, they align themselves in a regular crystal lattice, forming a plasma crystal. But on Earth these dust particles sediment; one can at best achieve a two-dimensional plasma crystal.

What is the diameter of a dust particle compared to the scale of an atom?,"In contrast to a crystalline solid which is composed of atoms, the length scale is larger by a factor of 10‘ (a dust particle is about 11m in diameter, an atom about 1 A), which means that one can observe the equivalent of atomic processes with.

What is the effect of kinetic energy removal on the motion of cold atoms?,"The term cold atoms refers to atoms from which kinetic energy has been removed. They move corre- spondingly slowly. In a dilute gas of cold atoms they hardly collide. Their free path length has a macroscopic dimension and they move in a ballistic trajectory in response to gravity. If one injects cold atoms into a resonator, one can construct highly precise atomic clocks with them by using their resonance frequency as frequency norm. ",True,3
What environmental condition enhances the performance of clocks based on atom residence time in a resonator?,"The residence time of the atoms in the resonator determines the quality of the time signal. Since atoms also react to gravity, their residence time in the resonator depends on the level of ambient gravity. Therefore, these clocks function best under microgravity conditions.. ",True,3

What processes involve the use of casts or molds in the production of metallic items?,7 Utilization of Spaceend and semifinished products are cast or molded; the solidification of metals is thus an important topic.,True,3
Why is homogeneity important at the phase boundary during solidification?,"In solidification it is important that the melt in front of the solid—liquid phase boundary, the solidifi- cation front, be as homogeneous as possible, because any kind of inhomogeneity at the solidification front would leave its traces in the solid. This refers to both temperature and concentration gradients. If con- vection cells are present, be they stationary or time dependent, this homogeneity is no longer assured. ",True,3
What type of conditions are most suitable for growing perfect single crystals?,"Perfect single crystals can best be grown under purely diffusive conditions, that is in the absence of any flow. Microgravity offers optimal conditions for the purpose.. ",True,2
What are the key factors influencing the process of crystalline material formation?,7.5.4.1 Crystal Growth,True,3
What factors are necessary for crystal growth under microgravity conditions?,"Crystals only grow if there is a driving force, namely a temperature and/or concentration gradient. Under microgravity conditions the Rayleigh number can be kept below its critical value so that these gradients do not lead to the formation of convection cells. However, free surfaces must also be avoided during convection-free crystal growth, since Marangoni convection would otherwise be inevitable. ",True,3
What effect does a high-melting oxide layer have on the floating-zone process during semiconductor crystal growth?,"In the floating-zone process, which is common for semi- conductor crystal growth, this is not the case. In this process a polycrystalline, cylindrical work piece is drawn through a narrow heating zone, melted and recrystallized. In the heating zone a free liquid surface is formed which leads to Marangoni convection. By coating the work piece with a thin layer, usually con- sisting of a high-melting oxide of the source material, the free surface and thus Marangoni convection can be avoided.. ",True,4
What advantage does microgravity provide for the growth of protein crystals compared to terrestrial conditions?,"A special case of crystal growth under micro- gravity conditions is protein crystal growth. Large protein crystals are required for structural analysis by neutron scattering. The crystalline structure of protein crystals is quite complex; that is, the unit crystal cell from which the crystal built is relatively large. Under terrestrial conditions the protein crystal is deformed by its own weight while it grows and the regular structure essential for structural analysis is interrupted. Under microgravity conditions it was possible to grow protein crystals superior in size and perfection to those grown on Earth.. ",True,3
What term describes the process where crystals form and grow in a specific direction during solidification?,2/24/09 2:41:22 PM 7.5 Materials Science7.5.4.2 Directional Solidification,True,2
What technique involves controlling solidification by directing a temperature gradient?,The Bridgman process is the most common process for so-called directional solidification in which the solidification front is forced in a particular direction by an imposed temperature gradient. Here the poly- crystalline material is placed in a cartridge which moves relative to two heating elements which generate a linear temperature profile. The solidification front is where the temperature is just equal to the melting point of the material. ,True,3
What arrangement in the Bridgman process eliminates convection without radial temperature gradients?,"The optimal arrangement is the vertical Bridgman process in which the tempe- rature gradient is exactly opposed (antiparallel) to the force of gravity, where there is stable layering. If radial temperature gradients could be avoided, then this arrangement would be free of convection even under terrestrial conditions. But if one is dealing with alloys in which concentration gradients as well as temperature gradients play a role, a situation can arise in which there is no stable layering. ",True,4
What happens when the concentration dependence of density and thermal expansion derivatives have opposite signs?,"In this case an analysis of buoyancy convection must consider the concentration dependence of the density. In addition to the thermal expansion d/dT, the concentration dependence of the density do/dc, plays a role. If both derivatives are of opposite sign, then stable layering is impossible and thermosolutal (buoyancy) convection takes place. Here the only remedy is microgravity.. ",True,3
What kind of metallic systems exhibit miscibility gaps in their liquid phase?,"Among metallic systems, the so-called monotectics deserve special attention. These are systems in which there are miscibility gaps in the liquid phase; that is, at particular temperatures and concentrations they sepa- rate into two immiscible liquid phases (Figure 7.5.6). A prominent example is Al-Pb. Such systems are, in principle, of considerable technical interest. If it were possible to finely disperse the two immiscible liquid phases and solidify them in that condition, then one could produce an ideal, self-lubricating material for bearings, whereby the hard phase takes over the sup- port function and the soft phase the lubrication. ",True,3
How do differing densities affect the behavior of lead and aluminum in the absence of Earth’s gravity?,"This is of course not possible on Earth because the two separated phases segregate according to their differing densities; that is, the heavy lead sinks and the light aluminum floats to the top. It was hoped that under microgravity conditions this effect would not exist. ",True,3
"In a CuCo alloy section, what distinguishes the light regions from the dark regions based on their metal richness?","Figure 7.5.6: Polished section of an (almost) completely separated CuCo alloy. The light regions are rich in copper, the dark ones rich in cobalt (Source: DLR).",True,2
What effect does surface tension have on the energy of a system with liquid droplet dispersions?,"and a fine dispersion could be produced. But, as in the case of Marangoni convection, surface tension is again the spoilsport. A fine dispersion of liquid droplets of the one component in the liquid matrix of the other component has a large interface which contributes to the total energy of the system because the boundary surface energy between both liquids is retained. This energy is reduced by the coagulation of many small roplets into a larger one. ",True,3
What determines the positioning of two liquids in relation to a container's surface?,"Therefore, the equilibrium configuration consists of a large drop of liquid sur- rounded by the second liquid. Which of the two liquids is on the outside or inside depends on which of the two oes a better job of wetting the container. One way to avoid this undesirable result is to quench the two-phase jisassociated liquid melt before coagulation begins.. ",True,3
What is the phenomenon called when a liquid is cooled below its freezing point without solidifying?,7.5.4.4 Undercooling,True,3
What condition allows cooling a melt below its freezing point without solidifying?,"The cases discussed so far dealt with solidification near thermodynamic equilibrium. But since solidification is a first-order phase transition, the onset of the solid phase requires a critical nucleus. If it is possible to suppress or at least delay nucleation, then it is possible to cool the melt below its freezing point without soli- dification. The result is undercooling. This metastable condition of an undercooled melt and its solidification. ",True,3

What condition must be achieved and maintained in materials research conducted under microgravity?,"is another fascinating field of materials science research under microgravity conditions. Here it is first neces- sary to achieve an undercooled condition and then to maintain it for a time. This means reducing the rate of nucleation. Besides the unavoidable homogeneous nucleation which is intrinsic to any system, there is also so-called heterogeneous nucleation, which is responsible for initiating solidification. ",True,3
What role do impurities play in the nucleation process of melts during solidification?,"Impurities and crystalline structures, as found for example on crucible walls, act as heterogeneous nuclei. Although the number of heterogeneous nuclei in a melt is much lower than the number of homogeneous nuclei, it is heterogeneous nucleation which prompts solidifica- tion. In order to study undercooling, undercooled mel- tsand their solidification, containerless processes have been developed in which the melt can be positioned and processed without contact with a crucible. ",True,3
What are the primary forces involved in the electromagnetic levitation melting process?,"Levita- tion melting, in particular electromagnetic levitation, is one of these processes. Electrically conductive samp- les are caused to levitate by means of a high-frequency spatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic field and are then melted. The Lorentz forces act as a levitation force and the ohmic losses of the turbulent flow induced in the sample provide the heat. This process is routine under terrestrial conditions and allows undercooling of several hundred degrees over long intervals (minutes to hours). ",True,4
How do microgravity conditions affect the flow in a sample during magnetohydrodynamic interactions?,As a consequence of magnetohydrodynamic interactions the induced flows also lead to convection and sometimes to turbulent flow in the sample. Under microgravity conditions the positioning field can be reduced because it no longer has to levitate the sample but only stabilize it against the residual gravity. This in turn greatly reduces flow in the sample.. ,True,2
What condition is necessary to experimentally confirm the relationship between solidification rate and undercooling?,"An undercooled melt is far from a condition of equilibrium. Its rate of solidification increases as the undercooling progresses. There are a number of theoretical predictions for the precise functional rela- tionship between solidification rate and undercooling. Experimental confirmation requires a convection-free undercooled melt, something that in the ideal case can only be managed under microgravity conditions.. ",True,3
What must the solid do to achieve equilibrium when it's warmer than the surrounding melt?,"If the solidification of an undercooled melt has already begun, then the system is in a paradoxical situ- ation: the solidified solid is warmer than the melt which surrounds it. To achieve equilibrium, the solid must give up heat to the melt. This is most successful if the interface to the melt, the solidification front, is increased.7 Utilization of Space",True,2
What type of solidification structure is shown in the provided figure of an alloy?,Figure 7.5.7: Polished section of a dendritically solidified alloy (Source: DLR).,True,2
What phenomenon leads to the formation of a mushy zone during solidification?,"Morphological instability is the result, namely a tran- sition or mushy zone is formed, in which dendrites® arise (see Figure 7.5.7). Dendrites are fractal structures with a very large surface. Their form and growth can be theoretically calculated. For experimental confirmation it is important that convection either be suppressed or its influence be taken into account mathematically. Another feature of solidification from undercooled melts is the fact that the phase diagram describing the existence range of the solid and liquid equilibrium phases is no longer valid. ",True,3
What occurs in non-equilibrium solidification that leads to the formation of solid phases with distinct properties?,"In the case of nonequilib- rium solidification, metastable solid phases can arise if their growth rate is higher than the growth rate of the equivalent equilibrium phase. By means of phase selection, solids can be produced which have different characteristics than they would have if produced by. ",True,3

",True,3
What is a significant drawback of developing systems based on gravitropic land plants in a weightless environment?,"The lack of gravity is the biggest disadvantage, because all systems developed to date use gravitropic land plants. These do not prosper under weightless- ness, if they grow at all, and do not produce edible fruits. The cause is likely the lack of thermal convec- tion around plants growing under weightlessness. For this reason, the CEBAS system, among others, was developed, which produces biomass in an aquatic milieu using nongravitropic plants and can provide animal protein as well as plant material [7.6.10].

How do semi-open systems differ in energy maintenance from completely closed systems?,"Despite all these problems, such systems have to be further developed until satisfactory solutions are found. Self-contained, completely closed systems which can be harvested will probably not exist for the time being; in most cases something has to be either added to the system somewhere or removed from somewhere else.

There is fluid displacement toward the head [7.6.17], [7.6.18], [7.6.19], which leads to a loss of liquid in the lower extremities of about 2 | and reduces the astronauts’ plasma volume by up to 20% [7.6.15], [7.6.20], [7.6.21]. ",True,3
What factors contribute to decreased red blood cell mass and plasma volume in astronauts?,"The production of red blood cells also decreases significantly during the first weeks in space, since erythropoietin production and release from the kidneys is reduced [7.6.22], [7.6.23]. The reduced plasma volume and lower red blood cell mass — the latter is critical for oxygen transport capacity — reduce the maximal exercise astronauts can undertake, especially after landing back on Earth. In addition, reduced plasma volume as well as an altered sympathetic nerve receptor density and threshold in the blood vessels and the heart can play a key role in orthostatic hypersensitivity. ",True,3
How does the redistribution of volume along the body axis influence thermal output in a weightless environment?,"Also, the shift of volume along the body axis from the body’s lower to upper half leads to noticeable changes in heat emission via the skin and probably affects the entire human heat balance under weightlessness. This is supported by recent data from relevant human physiology experiments in connection with parabolic flights (Figure 7.6.3).. ",True,3
What percentage of heat exchange is attributed to the head and neck under terrestrial conditions?,"Under terrestrial conditions the head and neck are responsible for over 30% of the heat exchange between the body and the environment. Forced convection to ventilate the space vehicle or the ISS could cause heat emission from this part of the body to be much higher.

What effect does weightlessness have on muscle and skeletal structure due to reduced mechanical loading?,"Both the muscles and skeleton require enough stimu- lus in the form of mechanical loading (“strain”) to be able to maintain their structure. Under weightless conditions this strain is reduced to a minimum. Muscle atrophy is noticeable after only a brief time in space, accompanied by structural and functional changes in the muscles as well as a negative nitrogen balance. This atrophy is especially pronounced in the posture muscles which support the body against gravity. ",True,3
What percentage of muscle mass do astronauts potentially lose during extended missions without intervention?,"Without corrective measures astronauts lose up to 20% of their muscle mass during a short mission and up to 50% during long-term missions [7.6.3]. This loss is higher in the group of extensor muscles compared to the flexors. The leg muscles have the highest loss since the astronauts move through their new environment mainly by using their arms.

What is the average monthly range for global bone mass loss due to inadequate strain?,"Changes in muscles are closely linked to changes in the skeletal system. Without adequate strain there is an imbalance between bone development and breakdown with a global loss of bone mass of 1 to 3% per month on average. In areas experiencing especially low strain the bone density is reduced by up to 10% [7.6.3]. Loss of bone mass causes hypercalciuria. Although other factors besides increased calcium levels in the urine are relevant (pH value, uric acid, oxalate), there is an increased risk of post renal stone formation [7.6.3], [7.6.15]. ",True,3

"How do visual, vestibular, and kinesthetic systems work together for environmental navigation?","The integration of visual, vestibular and kinesthetic stimuli makes orientation through the environment possible. The individual systems are interconnected. Thus proprioceptive and visual information lead to the vestibular system and from there back again to involuntary control of eye movement. The lack of gravitational stimulation leads to an incongruence of information of the semicircular canal of the inner ear, which independent of gravity only reacts to a change of position and the acceleration information from the saccule and utricle.

What types of food preparation are essential for long-duration space missions?,"Numerous factors must be considered regarding diet and nutrition. The food must be nonperishable (for months to years), the drinks powdered, the meals freeze-dried. Water is added and mixed into the food only on-board. Many meals are heated to high tem- peratures to make them long-lasting. All efforts must be made to avoid food poisoning, which could be life threatening for the entire crew on an interplanetary flight. ",True,3
What factors are crucial for meal selection in space missions?,"In recent years it has been shown particularly during long-term residence on MIR and the ISS that astronauts love “special event meals” to counteract the monotony caused by external circumstances [7.6.3].

What issues arise from consuming cookies in a zero-gravity environment?,"NASA has a collection of about 150 menus, to which another 150 menus from the Russians can be added on the ISS, so the astronauts have about 300 different menu variations available. Alcohol is not per- mitted. The day’s menu is divided into four segments: breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack. However, the consumption of cookies is problematic since crumbs are not easy to remove under weightlessness and can have unpleasant consequences like crumbs in the eyes, in other body openings, interference with technical and scientific equipment.

The latter can also sometimes lead to spontaneous vomiting under weightlessness.. ,True,3
What physiological changes in the oral cavity affect astronauts' taste perception in microgravity?,"Astronauts and cosmonauts have a marked pre- ference for strongly spiced food. In part, the reason could be the liquid displacement along the body axis caused by weightlessness, which causes the oral mucosa in the mouth and the tongue to swell (edema). Also, the distribution of food in the mouth changes because of weightlessness, which leads to an altered sense of smell. All these factors taken together are probably sufficient to show that nutrition under conditions of weightlessness — particularly for long flights — is a problem which should not be underestimated.

What impact does a diverse diet have on the psycho-physiological state of space travelers?,"It has already been well confirmed in isolation studies that a balanced, varied diet is a decisive factor for the overall psycho-physiological well-being of astronauts, whereby communal meals involving the entire crew also play an important role in the daily schedule (the social components of meals), independent of energy supply and taste [7.6.3], [7.6.15], [7.6.25].. ",True,2
How do energy requirements differ for astronauts in weightlessness compared to those in normal gravity?,"As far as energy requirements are concerned, it was surprising to discover that the caloric demand under weightlessness hardly differs from that in 1g conditions for the astronauts. This could be because there are increased energy requirements under weightlessness due to the daily muscle exercises instituted as a countermeasure to muscle and bone loss in space, as well as due to the forced convection by the air-conditioning system inside the spacecraft.

What are the symptoms commonly associated with acute radiation exposure?,"Clinical effects of exposure to radiation can be divided into short- and long-term effects. The basis for both is the formation of highly reactive free radicals by the radiation, which can damage cell components, parti- cularly DNA and other control molecules.

What particles emitted during solar eruptions contribute to radiation risk in space missions?,"Solar particles are another important source of radiation risk, primarily consisting of high-energy protons which are ejected into space during a solar eruption (solar particle event (SPE)). This radiati- on can significantly increase the energy of cosmic particles, up to several hundred megaelectronvolts per nucleus.

It can be seen that radiation exposure in scenarios 2 to 4 is substantial and that measures to protect the space vehicle, lunar or Martian habitat must be taken [7.6.28], [7.6.29].. ",True,3
What issues might affect an individual's mental and physical health due to living in space?,7.6.6 Psycho-Physiological Problems Arising from Residence in Space,True,2
How are day and night cycles simulated for humans in space environments?,"In space, humans are almost completely isolated from the physical and social environmental factors which normally determine their biorhythms. The terrestrial alternation between day and night is mimicked by con- trolling the artificial illumination in the space vehicle, and the daily fluctuations in ambient temperature are also artificially maintained, to mention only some of the relevant factors. ",True,2
How do endogenous biorhythms adapt to predetermined work and relaxation patterns during missions?,"Social factors, whose origins are family, workplace and friendships, are lacking. Endogenous biorhythms must adjust to a large extent to the mission’s predetermined work and relaxation rhythms. The duration and quality of sleep have to be so optimized that performance readiness and a subjective feeling of well-being are maintained. However, the need to more or less stringently organize the daily routine means that individual needs have to be adapted to the needs of the entire group, and this for the duration of the entire mis- sion. ",True,3
What are the scheduled work hours during the Russian isolation experiences?,"Negative consequences are inevitable because over long periods of time the astronaut’s psychological state and work capacity fluctuate considerably. In this respect observations made during terrestrial isolation studies do not differ significantly from Russian experiences on long missions [7.6.4]. The daily schedule during the Russian isolation experiences is as follows: work period 09:00 to 17:00, resting 17:00-23:00, sleeping 23:00 to 07:00, getting-up phase 07:00-09:00, with meals four times a day. Presumably, there is accordingly little oppo- rtunity for an individual style which significantly varies from this routine.. ",True,2
What was observed about activity patterns during weekends compared to weekdays in a four-week isolation study?,"Measurements of activity patterns with the help of accelerometers during a four-week ESA isolation study produced fairly similar results on workdays for all six test subjects [7.6.6]. Measurements on weekends showed, as expected, more individualized behavior patterns. Especially the distribution of sleep periods differed from the normal weekday pattern. However, strict regulation of the daily schedule should mean respecting natural sleep requirements, which during the day are especially pronounced after the main meal. ",True,2
What factors influence the sleep-wake pattern of astronauts during extended missions?,"It is known that forced, artificially extended periods of wakefulness negatively influence cognitive abilities, something which should definitely be avoided on long missions. But there is no general strategy which can be applied to the situation in space. The conditions under isolation and the length of the particular mis- sion influence the sleep-wake rhythm as well as the cognition of the astronauts. ",True,3
"What phenomena are observed after the initial adaptation period of a mission, indicating crew members' adjustment issues?","Russian experience has shown that after an initial 14-day adjustment period a mission phase follows in which there is full adaptation until about the 90th day. Afterward, sleep problems can be expected, the activity of the crew members is reduced, and a reduction in the range of their interests can be observed. Increased nervousness and tiredness become evident. Since these phenomena were found during terrestrial isolation studies as well as in space, itis hard to identify the role played by weightlessness. ",True,3
What is the impact of weightlessness on cellular and molecular biorhythmic processes?,"It is currently unknown how weightlessness affects biorhythmic processes at the cellular and molecular levels, and what the consequences are for the entire system.

What are the implications of confinement on mobility and interactions in a defined space?,7.6.6.2 Isolation and Constricted Movement,True,3
"What impact does prolonged confinement, including lack of exercise, have on human physiology?","In the course of dealing with the physiological con- sequences of long periods in space, medical doctors had to consider the problems of isolation, solitude, loneliness and confinement of movement [7.6.31]. Confinement is often connected with a lack of exer- cise, which plays a role in the discussion of corrective measures (see Section 7.6.7 below) as well as in this sec- tion. But isolation and confinement are not problems limited to space flight only; they can be observed every day in society. ",True,3

What must be developed to monitor physiological effects in changing environments?,"people) or because of external circumstances like the death of a partner. This trend is reinforced by increasing longevity. In order to identify the physiological effects of this change in ambient conditions, new, noninvasive technologies must be developed for continuous data collection. They should have low energy requirements, not get in the way when they are worn, and be easy to use by a layperson. ",True,3
What type of analyses are described as particularly valuable in handling large data streams?,"This continuous flow of signals produces large amounts of data which can only be managed with the help of modern information tech- nology. Time-series analyses are particularly valuable. When recording and processing data, the spectrum of stimuli, which is normal on Earth, should be kept in mind (Table 7.6.2).. ",True,2
How does the absence of gravity in space affect the stimuli experienced by the human body?,"For example, if gravity is lacking in space, then 40% of the body’s stimuli disappears. In the case of the other parameters, noise, smell and taste, no large vari- ations due to physical confinement are expected.",True,2
How does living in close quarters affect individual behavior and environmental stimuli?,"Living together in close quarters always means con- sideration for others; not what everybody wants, but what is the least disruptive has to be determined. This leads to an overall leveling down and to monotony. Iso- lation and confinement therefore mean a reduction or deficit in stimuli. In the best case this can lead to relax- ation followed by recovery, particularly if one has been living in an overstimulated environment. ",True,2
What initial process occurs when stimuli removal is necessary during extended space habitation?,"If the removal of stimuli is unavoidable, such as for long residence in space, the first step is light deconditioning leading to a vicious circle as described in Figure 7.6.5.. ",True,2
What are the psychological countermeasures used to combat challenges in low Earth orbit?,In LEO this can be combated by the indicated countermeasures which provide psychological and social support (telephone calls to family members) [7.6.31].

What are potential consequences of a monotonous environment in terms of reconditioning?,"monotonous environment in order to break out from the vicious circle which ends in total deconditioning. This situation can lead to not being able to readjust to terrestrial conditions. Stimulus substitution not only helps to make the stress associated with residence in space bearable, but also improves the chances for smooth readaptation to terrestrial conditions. Con- sidering the experience gathered under space condi- tions, rehabilitation measures on Earth, such as after long immobility and sickness, need reevaluation.. ",True,3
What is the maximum number of members in a crew as mentioned?,"The effects of a reduced social spectrum should not be underestimated. A crew consists of four to eight members at most, and they have to get along. The com- munication within such a group can vary considerably during a mission, as suggested in Figure 7.6.6.",True,1
What are the implications of social isolation among group members during a prolonged period of confinement?,"The number of verbal communications among group members during the joint meal in a 28-day period of isolation was recorded. On the second day it can be noted that the communication of person D with commander C dominates; the other members are almost excluded. But by the end of the mission (26th day), person D is totally isolated during the meal. This social isolation within the group can have somatic effects which must be avoided [7.6.32]. ",True,3
What effect do competitive group games have on isolation in a space vehicle environment?,"One reason for isolation might be modern computer games, which each person can play alone in some corner of the space vehicle resulting in sitting back to back at leisure time without communicating. Competitive group games can counteract such a development. Crew selection is important here, so that the team. ",True,2

Which factors are crucial for team cohesion and effectiveness during extended space missions?,"It can be said in summary that a multitude of parameters affect the group cohesion and perfor- mance of a team: cultural background, the leadership qualities of the commander, sex, age, emotional stability, expertise and cooperativeness, to name but a few [7.6.3], [7.6.15]. All these factors must be considered when a crew is selected for a long stay in space. Physiological performance factors also play a role, but not necessarily a dominant one, once the basic parameters have been achieved (well trained at least to an average level). Psychologists have an important role in deciding what is the right data to consider.. ",True,3
What are the actions taken to rectify deficiencies in a system or process?,7.6.7 Corrective Measures,True,3
What are the physiological adjustments of astronauts during extended stays in microgravity environments?,"It should first be pointed out that the physiologi- cal changes noted so far under weightlessness are adaptations which are appropriate for the space environment. The Russian cosmonaut Poljakov lived in the Russian MIR station for periods up to 14 months. Medical physiological problems usually occur when the astronauts are again subjected to a higher level of gravity, whether on Earth or in the future on the Moon or Mars. ",True,3
What systems are critical to maintain proper functioning during space missions?,"But here, particularly in the case of extravehicular activities in the context of a mission, physical fitness is the conditio sine qua non. Appropriate corrective measures must be taken, especially those assuring that the proper functioning of the cardiovascular, thermoregulatory skeletal and muscle systems is maintained. Providing emergency medical care for missions to the Moon or Mars could, just to consider the operational reasons alone, always. ",True,3
What is the primary method of evacuation for astronauts during a medical emergency in low Earth orbit?,"only be possible to a limited extent. For presence in LEO it is another matter, since in a medical emergency an astronaut or cosmonaut can be evacuated relatively quickly to Earth (rescue capsule, emergency descent), something which is not possible for lunar and certain- ly not for Mars missions.",True,2
What types of corrective measures can ensure the well-being of astronauts?,"Among the corrective measures in the narrower sense can be counted all those treatments and thera- peutic measures which serve to guarantee or restore the physical, mental and spiritual well-being and health of astronauts before, during and after a space flight. Physical, biochemical, chemical, pharmaceuti- cal, biological, and psychological measures are pos- sible. Table 7.6.3 provides an overview of various possibilities.. ",True,2
What factors are considered essential for crew selection in space flight preparation?,"In the preparatory phase of a space flight they include crew selection (“select in”) in order to assure a crew who are as efficient as possible and in which there is the lowest risk of interpersonal conflict. Physical and mental training programs have to be made available, and care must be taken to achieve the required physical fitness and high, continuous mental performance levels and alertness, not to mention programs which prepare the organism for altered circadian rhythms. ",True,3
What types of equipment are utilized in customized training methods during space flight?,"During the flight most of the corrective measures concern providing and carrying out an exercise program of several hours with the help of customized training methods like treadmills, flywheels, rowing equipment, a “penguin suit,” a vibration platform, etc. After return from space intensive psycho-physiological training pro- grams are necessary to accustom the astronauts to the terrestrial environment and to their social milieu (“postflight disorders”).

Before landing, there should be a possibility for the astronauts to be supplied with liquid in order to increase their plasma volume. This kind of liquid replenishment can still be carried out after orthostatic intolerance has developed. For this treatment practical devices for intravenous infusions and increasing plasma volume must be at hand for emergencies and the astronauts have to be trained in the technique of intravenous infusion.

In addition to various elastic band and stretching systems for resistance training, the procedures mentioned above for cardiovascular training can also be used, such as rowing machines or a treadmill, in which the trainee is pulled toward the machine via a system of elastic resistance bands (high-impact training to maintain bone structure). ",True,3
What pharmacological methods are utilized to preserve muscle tone and bone density?,It has been shown that already a slight amount of vibration exerts sufficient stimuli to maintain bone mass. The application of vibrations during the flight could help shorten the current tedi- ous exercise regime.

What physiological condition can result from conflicting sensory information in a zero-gravity environment?,"7.6.7.3 Neurosensory SystemThe lack of gravitational stimulation in space leads to incompatible information coming from the visual, vestibular and kinesthetic system, which can lead to what is known as space motion sickness [7.6.15], [7.6.24]. Although symptoms like dizziness, nausea",True,3
What factors complicate the prediction of space motion sickness in astronauts?,"and feeling ill recede after a few days, they often return upon entry into a gravitational field, which could hinder the continuation of the mission once the astronauts arrive on Mars. Unfortunately, there are large differences in the nature and particular expres- sion of symptoms, both between individuals and for the same person on different occasions. These often do not agree with observations made in experiments on Earth, making it difficult to predict susceptibility to space motion sickness. ",True,3
What effects can promethazine have on performance and mood during space motion sickness treatment?,"Selecting individuals with a high tolerance for movement, acceleration and deceleration did not produce the desired results. The use of biofeedback and autogenous training was successful in reducing some of the symptoms. Medication (e.g., promethazine) can also reduce the severity of space motion sickness, but it also can lead to a drop in performance (affecting reaction time and pattern recognition, for example) and can negatively influence sleep and overall mood..

What feature of a space vehicle provides maximum safety against solar radiation?,"On the technical side, the hull of the space vehicle itself supplies the most protection. Since most of the risk comes from high-energy solar particles moving slower than the speed of light, a satellite-supported early warning system could be put into operation. As soon as a solar event (eruption, solar wind) has been identified, the information can be relayed to the crew on-board the space vehicle, which would give them enough time to get to an especially shielded area [7.6.28], [7.6.29]..

What is the primary reason for the high costs associated with human space travel?,"Transporting persons into space, keeping them alive there and bringing them safely back to Earth requires a tremendous effort, which also finds expression in the high cost of this endeavor. The explanation is that humankind evolved in the course of some hundred thousand years to be optimally suited to conditions on Earth.

What factors influence the operation of a remote-controlled rover on distant planets?,"Either autonomously or controlled from Earth, rovers equipped with robotic arms can collect and analyze rock samples, or make preparations for human residence on distant planets. How remote control functions depends on what communications links are available and on the signal travel times. A robot on Mars would have to function as autonomously as possible. The operator on the ground can only define the goal, leaving it to the system in space to independently determine via calculations how it is to be accomplished. ",True,2
What independent functions must a robotic system perform due to extensive signal propagation delays?,"Here, direct remote control is not possible because of the long signal propagation delay (about 15 minutes).

What are the strategies to enhance the lifespan of satellites between their beginning and end of life?,"A typical servicing profile is usually associated with BOL failures, which may affect the entire mission. In the case of EOL failures (aging), the main interest is in increasing the lifetime beyond EOL; for example, in order to maintain the services provided by the satellite.

What technology is suggested for enhanced precision in determining the relative position of two vehicles during docking?,"In order to carry out the next phases in on-orbit servicing, a rendezvous and docking maneuver is necessary. In addition to the previously mentioned navigation capability required for remote inspection, a very precise resolution in determining the relative position of the two vehicles is particularly essential for docking maneuvers. This can be accomplished with exact distance measurements, but, ideally, with the aid of optical cameras and appropriate image processing. ",True,3

What requirements are placed on maneuvering and navigation systems when dealing with non-functional satellites?,"Target satellites can be of constant attitude and sta- tus if their attitude control system is functional. This significantly reduces the effort involved in tracking the target and especially in docking maneuvers.

What process involves manipulating a satellite's orbit and attitude with a service satellite?,"The next level of complexity in on-orbit servicing is moving the target satellite with the help of the docked service satellite, usually to take over the task of attitude and orbit control, or to deliberately change its orbit. The precondition is a successful docking procedure. In order to move the combined system, the service satellite undertakes variable thrust vectoring in order to efficiently utilize the available fuel, taking into account the momentary location of the center of mass of the combined system. The amount of propul- sion power is not decisive; rather this influences the inertia of the attitude control system.. ",True,4
What is the primary benefit of docking with telecommunications satellites at the end of their lifespan?,"The most profitable application for the already mentioned and yet to be mentioned types of on-orbit servicing is docking with telecommunications satel- lites at EOL and taking over their attitude and orbit control for a number of years in order to maintain profitable telecommunication services.

What aspect of servicing orbiting spacecraft can restore their functionality after refueling?,"also interfaces for transferring fluids and gases. In par- ticular, refueling of orbiting spacecraft is probably the most lucrative aspect of the named scenario because it fully restores the target satellite function and, after the refueling procedure, the service satellite is free to attend to other tasks at other targets. The automatic handling of connectors in orbit is technically possible if the respective robotic capability is fully available. ",True,3
What adaptations are required for robotic technologies to function effectively in orbit compared to ground operations?,"The capabilities of robots on the ground are well known and have been demonstrated. But to carry out these kinds of tasks in orbit, the technologies have to be adapted to different marginal and environmental conditions. Reliability must also be extremely high since the service satellite should not itself become a repair case.. ",True,3
What factors contribute to the operational lifespan of a satellite besides fuel management?,"Besides the automatic handling of connectors, the exchange of modules is probably the last link in the chain of applications described here. The service life of a satellite is defined not only by its fuel sup- ply and consumption, but also by the lifetime of its subsystems. If such subsystems can be so integrated into satellites in the future that they are accessible from outside, they could be exchanged by a robot arm. ",True,3

An appropriate sensor regime is also needed to improve the precision of the docking maneuver and thereby reduce the probability of collision.. ",True,3
What factors influence the design of service satellites operating within the Van Allen belt?,"e Orbit and Inclination: The design is primarily determined by the particular orbit. Service satellites crossing the Van Allen belt, in some cases several times, require additional radiation protection, which affects cost and mass.

Generally two types of design philosophies can be distinguished:e Design to objectives,True,3
What are the two primary philosophies that guide the design of a space system?,"The design of a space system is carried out according to one of these two philosophies. This means that either the system is primary designed to achieve the scientific, commercial, governmental or other objec- tives, or the primary requirement of the system design is compliance with a given fixed budget.",True,1
What is the primary goal of a design methodology that aligns with specified objectives?,Design to Objectives,True,3
What does a design-to-science project prioritize in space flight missions?,"The design philosophy of design to objectives can also be called design to science in the case of science mis- sions. A design-to-science project focuses on comple- tion of the mission objectives without any exceptions and cutbacks. The conception of all elements and segments of the space flight mission is justified by the achievement of the scientific, operational, commercial or military tasks. Completion of the defined mission objectives and tasks takes priority over the observance. ",True,2
What should a cost plan be complemented with to ensure project feasibility?,"of a cost limit. This does not mean that costs are not taken into account, but that cost planning results from the objectives and the planned implementation of a well-founded mission concept. The cost plan has to be supplemented with an adequate financing concept. If the planned time and cost budgets exceed the limits during mission development and accomplishment, opportunities for an increase in the budget as well as personnel and technical resources can be examined and exploited. Cutbacks or a decrease in the level of completion of the mission objectives is practically unacceptable.. ",True,2
What factors are crucial in defining the ultimate design process for a satellite mission?,"The design process according to the design-to- science philosophy is shown in Figure 8.2.2 using the example of a small satellite mission. The mis- sion objectives and constraints evolve from the idea for accomplishing the mission. The budget is a typical constraint which must be considered when the different mission options are evaluated, but the ultimate design process is defined by the objectives and the functional and operational requirements of the mission.

The main design flow is marked by the heavy arrows.(PAF: Processing and Archiving Facilities).,True,2
How do functional requirements influence the selection of orbit in a satellite mission?,"elements of a satellite mission. In the given example the choice of orbit and the need for a satellite constel- lation result only from the functional requirements. The costs which result from the orbit selection are of secondary importance. The space segment, which means the satellites and their payloads, is defined by the functional requirements and the optimum orbit or trajectory. The operational requirements define the mission operations concept. ",True,3
"What defines the frequency of satellite contacts, data disposal, and command sequence loading?","The costs which result from the mission operations come second in this case too. The communication architecture, the ground station concept and mission control result from the mission operations concept. This process defines how many times the satellite has to be contacted and how many times it has to dispose of its data or has to be loaded with new command sequences, and at what intervals it has to be moni- tored and controlled.. ",True,3
What philosophy prioritizes adherence to budget limits in design and mission performance?,"Design to Budget The design-to-budget or design-to-cost philoso- phy makes compliance with the budget limit the arbitrative criteria for the design, development and mission performance. Completion of the mission ob- jectives is in focus during the design process, but not without cutbacks and not at any cost. The design of the elements and segments of the space mission is focused on fulfilling the scientific, operational, commercial or military tasks and objectives, but only to the extent that the budget is not exceeded. ",True,2
What actions should be taken if a mission exceeds its current financial constraints?,"If a mission is not feasible within the existing budget, the objectives have to be reviewed by identifying the design drivers, then iterated and modified or reduced, if necessary. If neither option is feasible, the mission cannot be accomplished.. ",True,3
What influences the design of mission elements and segments at the start of a project?,The approved budget determines the design of all elements and segments of the mission right from the beginning of the project.

What principle defines the design of mission elements based on financial constraints?,"schematic design process according to the design-to- budget philosophy. The design of the mission elements is exclusively defined by the cost budget. For that reason the operations concept cannot be primarily designed according to the operational requirements. This can lead to providing only limited support in the ground segment, for example. Costs play a decisive role in the definition of the launcher, since it is usually one of the cost drivers of the mission. ",True,3
What considerations must be evaluated regarding launch strategies for satellites?,"For the first time questions arise about the launch strategy: Can there be a dedicated launch to the desired orbit, or is there an opportunity for a satisfactory compromise with other missions by arranging for a “shared launch” in order to split the launch costs with a partner, or an opportunity for a “piggyback launch” (meaning that the satellite can be carried as an auxiliary payload)? The answer to these questions defines in the first instance the orbit and the space segment. After this decision, the design of the other elements can be derived.. ",True,3

This results in the completion of the space system, which is one of the system segments. Usually, the process of integrat- ing the satellite bus with the payload is called system integration. Highly integrated systems are, however, not connected with an already completed satellite bus; instead, the satellite bus is constructed around the payloads. ",True,2
What does the system integration process involve regarding satellite subsystems?,"Therefore, system integration also means the assembly and integration of all subsystems of the bus and payloads.

In the case of a satellite with a propulsion system, the main components of the propulsion system are integrated (engine, nozzle, tanks, valves, pipes and other equip- ment). ",True,3
What is the initial electrical system that should be installed during integration?,"Then the wiring and, depending on accessibility, further components are integrated. Because of its func- tion, the first electrical system to be integrated should be the power system. In the next step the on-board computer is integrated, followed by the attitude control system and the communication system. Depending on access, the payloads are integrated. In the case of integra- tion of an optical payload, the payload can be verified after integration by optical ground support equipment (OGSE). ",True,3

What is a critical design feature for a lens system used with xenon lamps to manage thermal effects?,Cooling is also a main issue for the integrator.

Each individual segment is adjusted according to a complex procedure so that the defined uniformity and geometry can be achieved on the test plane.",True,3
Why must thermal properties of the collimation mirror be considered in numerical simulations?,"Having the collimation mirror at the right tem- perature has another important function: if not pro- tected by a shutter which has been shroud cooled with nitrogen, the mirror would also face the satellite when solar simulation is switched off. It would thereby represent a totally different heat source for the satellite than do the black surrounding thermal shrouds. This has to be taken into account, for example, in numerical simulations.

What method is used to control the temperature of the mirror segments?,"In order to protect the mirror itself from contamination by condensation of outgassed compo- nents, it is always kept at a higher temperature than the shroud and the test item.

What is essential to minimize in the motion simulator design due to gravitational effects?,"At the same time the self-deformation of the motion simulator due to gravity has to be kept to a minimum. Therefore, it has to be designed so it is stiff enough. High positioning accuracy is also required to test the function of heat pipes and the deployment of anten- nas at the satellite. Since those components are de- signed for zero-gravity operation, accurate orientation with respect to the gravity vector is necessary.. ",True,2
What is the purpose of the thermal shroud on the motion simulator?,"The motion simulator should not induce any ther- mal effects on the test specimen. It is therefore covered with a thermal shroud and has the same temperature as the chamber shroud. Since all actuators and control components of the motion simulator have to be suf- ficiently cooled for operation, even under atmospheric conditions, the whole internal part of the motion simulator is kept at atmospheric pressure with an air venting system.

What defines the relationship between unwanted emissions and immunity in electromagnetic compatibility?,"talking about electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) the conflict “disturb or be disturbed” is considered. In order to guarantee compatibility, EMC must keep the unwanted emissions below a given limit on the one hand, and guarantee immunity to disturbances from the outside (susceptibility to interference) on the other hand.

What is the purpose of the shielded chamber in EMC testing?,"The central part of an EMC laboratory is a shielded chamber (see Figure 8.3.20). Considering that our en- vironment is almost everywhere extensively supplied with communication services of all kinds (e.g., radio and television broadcasts, mobile telephones), all of which use high-frequency signal transmission, it must be guaranteed that their signals do not disturb an EMC test.

Improved theoretical models together with previ- ously simulated tests are important for efficiently conducting tests and understanding the achieved results.. ",True,3
What is the importance of operating test centers independently from manufacturers?,"Additional essential requirements for test centers are:e Test centers must be operated independently from the manufacturer in order to remain un- biased and neutral with respect to the test re- sults and the customer.

How does the mass of a satellite influence the expenses associated with space missions?,"The mass of a satellite plays an important role because of its direct impact on the launch cost, which is a major cost component of space missions. Especially in the case of interplanetary missions, overall mass reduction is of the highest importance because of the relatively small payload mass compared to other missions. One possible way to reduce cost is miniaturization. The cost for applications which can be realized by satel- lite missions can be reduced by using lightweight and small satellites. ",True,3
What is the maximum weight allowed for picosatellites classified as CubeSats?,"One of the latest activities in the direction of miniaturization is the development of picosatellites. Based on the work of two universities in the USA, namely Stanford University and California Polytechnic State University, a standard for picosatel- lites, called CubeSat, has been developed. CubeSats are picosatellites with a maximum mass of 1kg and dimensions of 10 x 10 x 10 cm. The standard is based on a deployment mechanism, the so-called P-POD, which can handle two or three CubeSats, allowing the payload mass to be increased accordingly. Today, more. ",True,3

Why is proper orientation crucial in applications like Earth observation or astronomy?,"The attitude control plays a special role here. A well-defined orientation is essential for many ap- plications such as Earth observation or astronomy, otherwise the target of the observation would be missed.",True,3
What criteria must be met for sensors to be suitable for controlling the orientation of picosatellites?,"In order to be able to control the attitude it must first be determined which sensors are to be used. For most of the attitude sensors known from larger satellites, such as star trackers, Sun sensors, gyros or Earth sensors, no appropriate versions are available for picosatellites. Existing sensors are too large, too heavy and require too much power. There is a similar situation for attitude control actuators. ",True,3
What types of devices are commonly utilized for attitude control in CubeSats?,That is why in most CubeSats today permanent magnets or magnetic coils are used for attitude control. In many cases there is no attitude control at all.. ,True,2
What are the primary frequency bands utilized for communication in picosatellites?,"Another bottleneck in the design of picosatellites is communications. Many applications, such as Earth observation, require the collection and transmission of large amounts of data to the ground station. The typical communication bands used today are the UHF and VHF bands, allowing limited data rates in the range of 1.2 to 9.6 kbit/s. Thus it takes a very long time to transmit larger images, which would make such applications practically impossible.. ",True,3

Two examples are microwheels suitable for picosatellites and an extremely low-energy S-band transmitter.",True,3
What is one benefit of using miniaturized components in nanosatellites?,"One of the advantages of miniaturization is the potential use of these components in larger satel- lites, such as nanosatellites. S-band transmitters for example can also be used in nanosatellites and would help to maximize the payload capacity remarkably. The same is of course true for other components, such as sensors for attitude determination. This additional payload capacity could then, for example, be used for larger optics, which would enable nanosatellites to run applications for which normally small satellites would be needed.. ",True,2
What advantage do constellations provide for sensor networks in space regarding measurement efficiency?,"The number of potential applications for pico- satellites will increase with the use of more and more suitable components. Especially promising are appli- cations in conjunction with constellations or forma- tions due to the low launch costs. Using constellations, it might be possible to build sensor networks in space where each of the satellites would take measurements simultaneously at different positions in orbit. ",True,3
What are the advantages of using multiple smaller satellites over larger ones in sensor networks?,"Some of the application fields can be Earth observation, observation of astronomical objects or space weather. This approach makes it possible to organize a much denser network of sensors than would be possible with larger satellites for cost reasons. It is conceivable to use either the same or different types of sensors on each satellite in the constellation, which also increases system redundancy. ",True,3
What potential benefit can arise from combining satellite sensors in a formation?,"Moreover, it might be possible in the future to combine the sensors of satellites within a formation to increase the aperture of an observa- tion system.. ",True,3
What is the potential use of picosatellites in space exploration tasks?,"Another field of application is to use picosatellites for exploration of the Solar System. Picosatellites could, for example, be ejected from larger spacecraft orbiting a planet and support the tasks of a probe, a surface-bound system or a rover.",True,2
What advantage do picosatellites offer for verifying miniaturized components in orbit?,"An additional application field for picosatellites is the verification of miniaturized components which, as mentioned above, are becoming more and more important. Miniaturized components can be verified in orbit much more frequently and at much lower cost by using picosatellites.",True,2

What considerations must be taken into account when defining a CubeSat mission's budget and time frame?,"There are many similarities with respect to the sys- tematics and tasks of the mission elements. However, the extent of these elements must be adjusted to the constraints, which in the case of CubeSats mostly mean that there is a very limited budget, limited time anda lack of experience on the part of the developers. Thus the first steps in establishing a CubeSat mission are to define the time frame and budget and to define the mission objectives.. ",True,2
What is the goal defined for a specific task or project?,8.4.2.1 Mission Objective,True,1
What is the primary goal of most CubeSat missions in the context of technology demonstration?,"The mission objective is the real task, the actual meaning of each CubeSat mission. The expectation for many scientific or technological applications is to verify the satellite or newly developed components for reliable operation in space, which opens the door for use in commercial applications. This so-called technology demonstration is the declared objective of most CubeSat missions.",True,2
What types of specific missions can CubeSats undertake beyond technology demonstrations?,"Not all CubeSats are limited to technology dem- onstrations. Many missions incorporate a camera to make images of the Earth. There are also efforts to equip CubeSats with instruments to measure rem- nants of the atmosphere in space, or to measure changes in the Earth’s magnetic field for clues on how to forecast earthquakes. But of course other objectives, such as communication tests with high data rates, robotic missions, constellation flights and Moon mis- sions, can also be imagined.. ",True,3
What is the relationship between the payload and the mission goal?,"The payload is directly correlated with the mission ob- jective, because it is only possible to reach the mission objective by using the payload successfully.

That is why CubeSats have been rarely considered so far as an alternative by scientific organizations. Thus, there is a large demand for the miniaturization of instruments.",True,2
What is tested in a technology demonstration mission?,"If the mission is a pure technology demonstra- tion mission, then the component to be tested is the payload, which could be a component of a subsystem, a subsystem or even the satellite itself. In the last case, there is no simple distinction between satellite bus and payload.8.4.2.3 Satellite Bus",True,2
What essential structure is necessary for payload operation in orbit?,"To achieve the mission objective a payload is needed, and to operate the payload safely in orbit a satellite bus is required. The tasks of the satellite bus are the mechanical integration of the payload, data commu- nication with the ground station, thermal and attitude control of the satellite, and other tasks described in the system design section.",True,2
What are the challenges CubeSats face when operating in higher orbits compared to low Earth orbits?,"Up to now only low Earth orbits (LEO, 300-800 km) have been considered suitable for operating Cube- Sats. There are several reasons: one is that the power demand of the communication subsystem for reliable data transmission increases dramatically with in- creasing orbital height, something which cannot be handled by today’s CubeSats. Moreover, higher orbits are more demanding as to radiation load, thermal is- sues and power management. Finally, the launch cost for LEO is lower than for higher orbits.. ",True,3
What type of orbit is appropriate for attitude stabilization using a permanent magnet?,"The mission objective and mission operations determine the selection of a suitable orbit. A Sun- synchronous orbit, for example, can be very suitable regarding the power and thermal subsystem require- ments and provides a nearly global coverage. On the other hand, an equatorial orbit is more suitable for attitude stabilization with a permanent magnet since a more homogeneous magnetic field exists there.. ",True,2
What is required for a CubeSat to reach its intended orbit?,8.4.2.5 Launch vehicleIn order to reach orbit a suitable launcher is needed. In principle a CubeSat can be launched by any modern8 Spacecraft Design Process,True,2
What factors limit the frequency of CubeSat launches despite meeting vibration test criteria?,"launcher as the vibration test specifications for Cube- Sats (and thus the qualification for flight) are satisfied by virtually all present launchers. However, currently there are not many launches of CubeSats. One reason is that the operators of the main payload (mostly commercial satellites) must accept the CubeSat as a secondary payload. The launch service providers too must accept a secondary payload, and often it is not worth taking the risk. ",True,2
What type of missiles were previously used for CubeSat launches?,"Luckily, two to three CubeSat launches a year have taken place, thanks to the efforts of institutes in Canada, the USA and Japan. The former Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like DNEPR and Rockot are especially suit- able for these launches, and there are also efforts to develop new launchers for small satellites. But in that case the launch costs would again be very high. There is another, simpler option for launching CubeSats, which is direct ejection from the Space Shuttle.. ",True,4

Students can operate such a ground station as well as perform the data analysis.,True,2
What is the significance of the standardized interface for CubeSats regarding launcher integration?,"The main reason for the popularity of CubeSats is especially the standardized interface to the launcher, namely the P-POD (Poly Picosatellite Orbital De- ployer). Because of the specifications defined in this standard, the satellite is widely decoupled from inte- gration in the launcher. This makes it possible to start the development of the satellite before the launcher itself is selected and financed. ",True,3

What advantage do CubeSats have by utilizing newer hardware in their designs?,"space-qualified parts are extremely expensive. One positive side effect is that these parts often have bet- ter performance related to mass and power demands compared to their space-qualified counterparts. This is because the latter have to be qualified by design or tests, which takes a lot of time. In fact, such chips are already out of date when they are released on the market. However, the space branch is very conservative and mostly only such parts are used. Thus CubeSats can turn this situation to their advantage by using the latest hardware at the cost of higher risk.. ",True,3
What are the main factors influencing the design of a satellite's bus?,For the design of a satellite it is useful to build the satellite bus around the payload.

Sensors and actuators which are known from larger satellites are too large, too heavy and need too much power to use in CubeSats.",True,3
What is the primary method used to stabilize a CubeSat's orientation?,The simplest form of controlling a CubeSat’s at- titude is to use permanent magnets. This stabilizes the attitude of the satellite so that fast rotations can be avoided. But it is not possible to achieve a controlled attitude change with this system. Attitude control systems using magnetic coils as actuators are an enhancement. Attitude determination is then often accomplished by magnetometers or by using the solar array currents. The expected accuracy of such a system is very low.. ,True,2

Only the require- ments for redundancy and reliability can be reduced in order to remain within the cost frame. On the other hand, more than one CubeSat might be built, which could provide redundancy on the system level.. ",True,3
What is the primary function of a propulsion system in vehicles or spacecraft?,8.4.4.2 Propulsion System,True,2
What are the two methods of propulsion being developed for small satellites?,"There are also no specific micropropulsion systems suitable for CubeSats. But two different methods are being developed: chemical and electrical propulsion. Cold gas propulsion systems or, for example, systems using hot water vapor belong to the first category. These systems are able to produce significant thrust for a short time in comparison to electrical propulsion systems and are therefore more suitable for CubeSats. ",True,2
What type of particles are used in electrical propulsion systems for generating thrust?,"Electrical propulsion systems use electrons or ions for impulse generation, which provide low but continuous thrust levels. With such a propulsion system a reentry system could be designed which ensures the reentry of the satellite after a defined time period. Another possibility would be to increase the orbital altitude.

What must be integrated into the communication system to facilitate satellite and ground station data exchange?,"In order to communicate, the satellite must be able to receive telecommands and send data. Because computer systems communicate using binary data, whereas a radio communication link uses electro- magnetic waves, a number of components must be incorporated into the communication system. In the following, data transmission from a CubeSat to a ground station is explained as an example. This discus- sion is principally limited to the use of amateur radio frequencies, due to the high complexity and costs as- sociated with registering a dedicated frequency.. ",True,3
What process involves converting data into a format suitable for transmission on a satellite?,"The data to be transmitted (e.g., measurements, status information, etc.) is first formatted on-board the satellite by the board computer, and packetized if there is a large amount of data to be transmitted. The AX.25 Protocol is very suitable for this purpose and widely used amongst amateur radio operators. But in principle it is possible to use one’s own protocol. Then the binary data is modulated by a modem into a baseband signal of lower frequency. ",True,2
What modulation techniques are suggested for improved bit error rates over AFSK 1200bit/s?,"Often the slow AFSK 1200bit/s modulation scheme is used, which can be demodulated by many ground stations. For a better bit error rate it is advisable to use MSK, PSK or some other modulation technique with higher bit rates. The baseband signal is then modulated onto a high-frequency carrier signal by the transmitter. This is achieved by using FM modulation by commercial transmitters, which are used in CubeSats. ",True,3
What types of antennas are typically utilized for transmitting signals as electromagnetic waves?,"Finally, the signal is transmitted into space as an electromagnetic wave by the antenna. In general some kind of rod or patch antenna can be used for this purpose.. ",True,2
What is more crucial for the transmission of commands to a satellite than high data rate?,"Uploading of commands is done in a very similar way. The difference is that on Earth the ground sta- tion may use much higher power than the satellite does for transmission. On the other hand, the amount of data to be transmitted to the satellite (telecom- mands) is a fraction of the data which the satellite has to transmit. In this case it is more important to have a reliable link than a high bit rate. One possible solution is to use DTMF tones for commanding (of course again modulated onto a high-frequency carrier signal).. ",True,3
What signal modulation method is commonly used by CubeSats for transmitting beacon signals?,"Almost all CubeSats transmit a beacon signal which contains the call sign of the satellite and critical status information. This is often done in Morse code utilizing OOK (On-Off Keying), which switches the carrier on and off. The beacon is also used to better track the satellite.8.4.4.4 Power System",True,3
What type of solar cells are favored for their efficiency in CubeSats despite their higher cost?,"The only energy source which can so far be used for CubeSats is the conversion of sunlight by solar cells. As the total area on which solar cells can be mounted is very small due to the small size of a CubeSat, the conversion must be done very efficiently. New de- velopments (multijunction GaAs solar cells) are preferred for this reason, although their price is much higher and they are more difficult to purchase than other options. ",True,3
What battery technology is recommended for satellites operating in the Earth's shadow?,"If the satellite is planned to be active in the Earth’s shadow, which is desirable, for example, when recording system status information, then batteries must also be built into the system. In this case modern lithium-ion accumulators are used because of their high energy density. An integral part of the design of the energy system must be to ensure that the satellite has enough excess energy in the sunlight phase (which is used to charge the batter- ies) to compensate the loss in the shadow phase after considering all losses in the system.. ",True,3
What is the purpose of DC/DC converters in energy distribution systems?,"Another element in the power system is the condi- tioning and distribution of the energy. Using DC/DC converters (upconverters or downconverters) the volt- age levels are transformed from the solar cells or bat- teries to the levels needed for the power bus systems. The most common voltage levels are 3.3V and 5V as the power supply for electronic circuits. Selected loads or complete subsystems can be switched on and off by using transistors. This can be done, for example, to reset the board computer or to put the satellite in a power-saving mode.. ",True,3
What is the main role of the computer onboard the satellite?,8.4.4.5 Command and Data Handling SystemThe on-board computer is the central unit for pro- cessing digital procedures and data on the satellite.

What are the key considerations when selecting a microcontroller for a specific application?,"the main computer, a microcontroller. The selection of a suitable MCU (Micro-Control Unit) is arbitrary as there are many modern MCUs and a high number of derivatives provided by established manufacturers. The 8051 and HCS12 families of microcontrollers are widely used. It is of course important that the MCU has all the needed interfaces and enough I/O pins. One of the interfaces, for example, is the I2C bus interface. ",True,3
What type of memory is used for temporary data storage in this system?,"This bus system is widely used in entertainment elec- tronics but it is also suitable for CubeSats due to its simplicity. With this bus system the controllers can communicate and also read out other components and control them. Besides receiving and executing com- mands from the ground station, the board computer has to read and store the necessary data. Temporary data can be kept ina SRAM, while data which have to be stored for longer time periods or large amounts of data are stored in a flash-type memory. ",True,3
"What type of memory preserves data when power is lost, despite concerns about radiation?","This type of memory retains the data even if the power supply is switched off. However, the radiation issues regarding flash memory are controversial, so it is a good idea to plan suitable means to protect the data (e.g., by using error-correction codes).. ",True,2
What principle governs the transfer of heat within a thermal system?,8.4.4.6 Thermal System,True,3
What is the approximate temperature range inside a CubeSat in LEO during exposure to sunlight and shadow?,"In a typical LEO with about 60 minutes of sunlight and 30 minutes of shadow a CubeSat is exposed to extreme temperature changes. In the shadow the satellite is exposed to almost space background (ap- prox. —270°C), while in the sunlight it is exposed to one solar constant plus the reflected light from the Earth’s atmosphere or from the Earth itself (albedo). As a rule of thumb (confirmed by real measurements of CubeSats) it is assumed that the temperatures in- side the CubeSat will be between —20 and +20°C. ",True,2
What temperature requires active heating measures for certain components exposed to sunlight?,"But when the area is directly illuminated by the Sun the temperature is expected to be +80°C. Although these temperatures are relatively moderate (most of the industrial parts survive these temperatures without any problem), for some parts special measures must be taken. This might be a measurement device or the battery, which cannot operate at low temperatures. It is often not enough to use passive elements (paint, surface structure, etc.) to prevent these elements from undercooling. In these cases it is mandatory to heat them actively. Heating foils are suitable for applying. ",True,2
What considerations should be taken into account to minimize heater operation duration in spacecraft design?,8 Spacecraft Design Processheat directly. But because such heaters consume a lot of energy it is advisable to carefully plan the optimum configuration and location so that the duration of heater operation can be minimized.8.4.4.7 Structure and Mechanisms,True,3
What is the purpose of the access port in a CubeSat design?,"As mentioned in the introduction, the outer structure is defined by the CubeSat specification. In addition, the specification requires the design of a so-called “access port,” which is used as access to the satellite to “remove the before-flight pin,” which enables the power system of the satellite. The real challenge in the design of a CubeSat lies in the design of its mecha- nisms. The tight conditions of the outer dimensions do not allow large parts on the outside. ",True,3
What is the maximum allowable extension for external components to avoid contact with the P-POD walls?,External parts are allowed to extend only 6mm at maximum in order not to touch the P-POD walls. Mechanisms such as antenna or solar panel deployment must live with this limitation.. ,True,1
What challenges arise from the distribution of functions in a compact satellite design?,"Because of the small size, the inner structure can also be very compressed. It is not enough to shrink the components and then build the satellite in a box- like architecture. It may be necessary to distribute functions which are normally built into one box over the different levels of the satellite. Integration and cabling can therefore be demanding challenges from the construction point of view. ",True,4
What are the advantages of expanding a CubeSat to a double or triple unit?,The CubeSat specification allows enlargement of a single CubeSat to a double or triple unit. This possibility is used to get more room for the components and to increase the power capacity.. ,True,2
What key beliefs guide the development and application of models in engineering and science?,8.4.5 Model Philosophy,True,2
What types of models are used in the development of a CubeSat before reaching the final flight model?,"The development of the final flight model of a Cube- Sat goes through a series of test models, which become more and more detailed from one project phase to the next. These are functional prototypes, engineering models, qualification models and finally the flight model. Because of time and budget restrictions, the qualification model and the engineering models are often combined, as described in the following. ",True,3

The aim here is simply to verify the func- tion of the design of new parts or assemblies.,True,3
What testing conditions must a non-qualified battery undergo before its use in a satellite?,"If, for example, a battery which has no space flight heritage and is not qualified for space is used, it must first be tested extensively. In this case the battery would be exposed to vacuum for long time durations and many charge and discharge cycles would be applied to it. Then, when the satellite is constructed and all systems integrated, the satellite undergoes extreme environmental tests in the assembly, integration and test (AIT) phase. ",True,3
What must be verified to ensure components function properly in future applications?,"For this reason the parts or assem- blies must be tested in advance to ensure that they will function later when they are installed in the satel- lite. It is extremely important of course to verify not only that the components survive the environmental conditions, but also that each system fulfills the task it was designed for.. ",True,3
What method is recommended for building and testing circuits by IC manufacturers?,"For this purpose so-called breadboards are built for electrical assemblies. These are supplied with all necessary inputs (power, data, measurements, etc.) according to the black box principle and the outputs are monitored. Even circuits developed by IC manu- facturers are recommended to be built up and tested using this method. The prototypes of the different as- semblies (Figure 8.4.4) can be successively integrated afterwards to test the functionality on the subsystem level. The test on the system level then takes place during the AIT phase.. ",True,2

But normally small differences arise, especially during the qualification tests in order to correct minor issues. The test requirements are treated in the AIT section. At this point it should be mentioned that after finishing the EM tests, the flight model can be constructed.

What is the purpose of the radio link test model in relation to the satellite's features?,"The structure model (SM) is used not only for the tests mentioned in Table 8.4.1, but also for the veri- fication of the cabling and integration concept. The radio link test model (RTM) is used to measure the antenna characteristics in conjunction with the actual structural properties of the satellite. This is important due to the fact that the satellite is very small and strong interactions between the structure and the antenna characteristics can be expected. ",True,3
What is the primary purpose of the combined engineering and qualification model in satellite testing?,"The combined engi- neering and qualification model (EQM) goes through all qualification tests.

What is essential to demonstrate during the AIT phase of satellite development?,"The AIT phase can be considered as the most criti- cal phase in the development of the satellite. In this phase it must be shown not only that each assembly and subsystem does work properly, but that all parts are working together. All previously defined interfaces must be tested extensively in order to detect and cor- rect possible failures (e.g., endless loops in software). The mission should be simulated with all relevant aspects such as sending telecommands and receiving data, because, although everything may be modeled very carefully, some errors can only be detected in the fully integrated system.. ",True,4
What is a recommended strategy for outlining integration steps after completing assembly and subsystem development?,"When the development and construction of all as- semblies and subsystems is completed, they must be integrated.

What are the recommended conditions for conducting the assembly of smaller satellite systems?,"the sequence of integration, should be kept in mind as well. The integration itself should take place under clean-room conditions as far as possible.

It is also very useful to extensively document the in- tegration process with photos. ",True,2
What two methods are available to access the satellite after integration?,"After integration the satellite can be accessed via the access port (or via the radio communication link) in order to receive mea- surement data or to check specific system functions.

What is the purpose of conducting vibration tests during satellite qualification?,"The aim of these tests, which are described in the following, is the qualification of the satellite for the launcher (whereby it should be ensured that the satellite does not endanger other payloads on-board the launcher and can safely reach the orbit) and to ensure that the satellite will survive the extreme orbital conditions.8.4.6.2 Vibration Tests",True,3
What type of tests simulate mechanical loads on the satellite during its launch?,"The first group of tests is vibration tests, where the mechanical loads which are induced on the satellite during launch are simulated. Due to the fact that in many cases there is no signed launch contract during the development phase of the CubeSat (in many cases the launch negotiations are started after the qualifica- tion review), these tests should be organized in sucha way that a variety of launchers can be considered.

What method can incorporate room temperature levels into thermal analysis for accurate predictions?,"The cold background requires more effort. It is, however, possible to design the thermal analysis in such a way that it can be decoupled from the test.

What format do two-line elements for satellites follow?,One important aspect of mission planning is the visibility prediction of the satellite from the ground station. In the case of CubeSat projects it is common today to use suitable freeware or shareware software tools.

How do access times to locations assist in determining the activation schedule of devices?,"The accuracy of the elements is good enough for ground station antenna tracking.

What is the impact of the x-panel's maneuver on heat dissipation for the spacecraft?,"The x-panel never sees the Sun because of this maneuver; therefore it can radiate all dissipated heat from the spacecraft into cold space. With the z-axis pointing of the main mission antenna toward the center of the Earth (nadir pointing), the antenna provides a nearly constant power flux density on the visible surface of the Earth because of its isoflux characteristic. This special characteristic assures that more RF power is radiated effectively toward the edge of coverage rather than to the subsatellite point.. ",True,3

What frequency band is utilized for RF communication links in the telemetry and telecommand system?,The telemetry and telecommand system (TM/TC) connects the globally distributed TM/TC stations to the two dedicated GCCs in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich and Fucino near Rome and to the satellites via RF communication links in the 2 GHz frequency band (S-band). Through these links the two centers control the housekeeping functions of all Galileo satellites in space. Telecommand and telemetry signals from TM/TC stations are handled by two helical receiver and transmit antennas located on opposite corners on-board the satellite and the TM/TC transponder (see Figures 8.6.2 and 8.6.5). ,True,2
What type of modulation is used for the telecommand signal in this system?,"To receive the telecom- mand signal the transponder demodulates the BPSK- modulated telecommand signal of 1 kbit/s NRZ-L and channel encoded and source encoded with a standard BCH block code. The transponder receiver delivers the data stream to the ICDU via the platform security unit. The telemetry stream information is delivered at a bit rate of 20 kbit/s NRZ-L encoded to the same antennas for transmission to the TM/TC ground stations.

What is the purpose of the RS convolution code in data protection?,the data content is protected with a Reed-Solomon (RS) convolution code to detect and correct single bit errors. All encoding applied to the TM/TC links is to protect them against bit errors resulting from noise and interference on the RF propagation channel. Both links for TM and TC can be operated either in the ESA standard mode or in the relatively new direct sequence spread-spectrum mode (also standardized by ESA). ,True,3
What mode allows the calculation of slant range to a satellite from the ground station?,"By radio command, the TC uplink and the TM downlink can be interconnected in the spacecraft to provide a direct data return link. In this configura- tion the two interconnected channels provide an ac- tive means for determining the slant range from the ground station to the connected satellite. This mode enables determination of the satellite’s position and thus, when repeated at later dates or from different ground stations, allows derivation of the Kepler data set necessary to predict the orbit. ",True,2
What ensures reliable access for ground stations under all satellite attitude conditions?,"For Galileo this methodology is not sufficiently accurate. Therefore, in the Galileo system, a sophisticated global groun mission and sensor network, including laser ranging stations, determines the high-precision orbit para- meters. Before entering the ICDU the telecomman data is decrypted in a classified hardware environment to avoid unauthorized intrusion into the comman links. Two receive and transmit antennas with an omnidirectional antenna characteristic (—3 dBi) are mounted on both the lower and upper side en positions of the satellite to ensure reliable access of the TM/TC ground stations to the satellite under all attitude conditions.

What is the estimated total velocity change a satellite can achieve with its thrusters over its operational lifetime?,"satellites do not need a powerful propulsion system for orbital maneuvers. With the small 10N thrusters and 70 liters of monopropellant fuel (hydrazine), a satellite creates a total Av of about 180m/s over its lifetime, which is sufficient to drift eventually into its final graveyard orbit. The three-axis attitude control ensures permanent orientation of the +z-axis toward the center of the Earth (nadir pointing) while the solar arrays remain Sun pointing during each orbital revolution. ",True,3
What types of sensors are utilized for determining satellite attitude?,"Two Sun sensors, one each for coarse and fine tracking of the Sun, and two Earth sensors pro- vide all the information required to determine the actual attitude. Three redundant computer-controlled wheels with large rotating masses orient the satellite around the three degrees of freedom (axes) and are able to achieve any required attitude position. A com- prehensive software package for attitude control takes over immediately after separation from the launcher. ",True,3
What is the initial action performed after separation in this software package?,"This unique software package provides all control and monitoring functionality and can be activated by ground control commands. One of the first maneuvers after separation and housekeeping tests is to deploy the solar arrays to ensure sufficient availability of primary power. The software also provides autonomous activities, for example, in case of an emergency, by changing the attitude into Sun acquisition mode as the fail-safe mode and alerting ground control to take appropriate action. ",True,3
What is the purpose of having a globally distributed network of 10 ground stations for satellite communication?,"Besides keeping the satellite in Sun-pointing mode to maintain electrical power supply, in this case it would also be important to maintain stable thermal conditions in each area and to configure the other systems of the satellite in a standby mode to support satellite-saving measures. A globally distributed network of 10 ground stations is located such that at any moment in time each satellite is in direct radio line of sight of at least one station.. ",True,3

What is the desired accuracy for ranging measurements from a ground terminal to a satellite?,"For ultra-precise ranging and orbit determination, the satellites are equipped with a passive laser ranging reflector (LRR) located on the Earth-pointing surface (+z). Because the overall achievable ranging accuracy should be in the order of less than 1 m over a slant range distance of about 26000000 m from a ground terminal to the satellite, the instantaneous position of the satellite varies slightly due to the slightly varying.

What type of fuel system is utilized for the propulsion in this context?,"Due to the very limited number of satellite orbital maneuvers, the propulsion system comprises a mono- propellant (hydrazine) system with a spherical tank of about 100 liters volume and four fully redundantly provisioned 1N thrusters. The tank is mounted on an enforced frame structure to cope with the high dynamic forces during launch and separation. Pipes made of special titanium alloys deliver the fuel from the tank to the thrusters through electrically control- lable valves. ",True,4
What is the purpose of the external connector during the launch process?,"For safety reasons, during the launch campaign a “safe”/“arm” connector accessible from outside the satellite prevents the unintentional fir- ing of thrusters. This connector eventually is set to the “arm” position as one of the final steps in the countdown procedure after the spacecraft is fully loaded with fuel, mounted in the fairing and ready for launch. The propulsion system also has a drain outlet to evacuate the tank during qualification tests when the tank is filled with nontoxic replacement liquids, and also in case of an aborted launch..

What is the serial data bus used in the Galileo satellites for data and control communications?,"Today, the wire and cable harness still forms the cen- tral nervous system of a satellite. There is a growing trend to use serial data buses for the data and control communications, as in industrial and home computer networks. On-board the Galileo satellites the serial 1553B bus is applied, which is not optimized for sat- ellites but which has evolved over many years into a more or less de facto standard. ",True,3
What type of communication bus is implemented in one of the preoperational satellites?,"Other buses, such as the CAN bus widely used in the automobile industry, is used in one of the two preoperational Galileo satellites (GIOVE A).

What is the primary purpose of ultrastable frequency standard generators in communication systems?,Ultrastable Frequency Standard Generators,True,3
"What type of generator is essential for navigation satellites, providing precise frequency signals?","The core of all navigation satellites is the on-board ultrahigh-precision clock generator, selected from a group with different technologies and redundant standards. They are also called “clocks,” although they actually provide a precise frequency signal or pulse trains and not “real time-clock” information. A real time clock with hours and minutes is derived from such a clock generator by a time definition of the Galileo on-board and system time. ",True,3
How is the instantaneous time discrepancy measured and communicated from space to the ground system?,"Real time is internationally defined by convention of time and date. This time is defined in the ground station and synchronized to the international reference of coordi- nated universal time (UTC) by counting the seconds to higher units (minutes, hours, etc.). The ground system time is compared to the actually disseminated signal time from space and the instantaneous time error (ns) is transmitted via the navigation message. ",True,4
What types of atomic clock technologies are employed by Galileo satellites?,"With this information, receivers correct the instantaneous time error by “software” rather than by adjusting the hardware. Galileo satellites apply two different tech- nologies for the clocks: the more traditional rubidium atomic frequency standard (RAFS), used on-board GPS satellites for many years, and two highly sophisti- cated passive hydrogen masers (PHMs) developed by European industry under ESA contract specifically for this application.

What unit manages the selection of the master clock signal aboard the satellites?,"The clock generator generates a time signal to the highest precision regarding phase noise, frequency stability and lowest drifts. The frequency stability of RAFS is in the order of 107s while the PHM can achieve a long-term stability of 107’ s over 24h.

How is on-board clock accuracy regulated in spacecraft without physical adjustments?,"All clocks run continuously, providing the mas- ter clock as selected by ground control. On-board clock accuracy is controlled on the ground with an ensemble of high-precision clocks at the locations of many standard time service providers. Devia- tions are not corrected by physical clock corrections but through parameters of a clock model taking all impacts including the relativistic compensation into account. ",True,4

What method is used for spreading PRN-coded subcarriers in Galileo signals?,"The PRN-coded subcarriers applied for the Galileo signals are spread by direct sequence spreading up to 15 million chips. The NSGU generates all the signals at baseband level, as shown in Figure 8.6.1. By means of different binary offset coding (BOC) schemes the signals have different spectral power distributions, which is desirable for sharing frequency bands among the many signals of the same constellation as well as among signals of different constellations.

What percentage of the symbol rate is allocated for net data information after accounting for redundancy bits?,"Since the redundancy bits ensuring the required forward error correction (FEC) capability require an overhead of 50% of the symbol rate, it leaves the other 50% for net data information. This capacity enables transmission of all mandatory system information, comprising almanacs, ephemerides, time error and geodetic reference data, as well as integrity information and acknowledgment messages for dis- tress calls and more, differing for each signal..

What is the effect of the beam-forming networks on the received power level across different coverage locations?,"wavefront and the required isopower flux characteris- tics. The isoflux characteristic means that the received power level at a received reference antenna located on the Earth’s surface stays nearly equal if the antenna is located at the center of the radiation (boresight equal to subsatellite point) or at the edge of the coverage. This special characteristic is achieved for both fre- quency bands, 1164-1300 MHz and 1559-1594 MHz, by two physically implemented beam-forming net- works mounted below the feed array. ",True,3
What is the elevation angle at which the antenna exhibits lower gain?,The antenna design is quite sophisticated as some of the elements contribute to both bands. The antenna gain is adjusted to the coverage requirements of that antenna which serves the entire visible surface of the Earth.

What function do local user terminals perform in the COSPAS-SARSAT system regarding distress calls?,"So-called local user terminals (COSPAS-SARSAT LUTs) receive the distress calls that are repeated through Galileo (and other GSO and non-GSO) satellites and generate a dedicated ac- knowledgment message to the particular distress-call- ing terminal (emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB)) through the navigation message in the Galileo open service signal. By notifying the caller that the call is affirmed and that appropriate rescue actions are underway, including brief messages about the measures taken, the caller is made aware of the status and can stop any further transmissions, lead- ing also to more efficient use of the sensitive distress call channels..

"What frequency will remain for search and rescue operations as of February 1, 2009?","Besides receiving distress calls from a new generation of EPIRBs with built-in GNSS receivers, the system also still supports the use of the legacy mode where EPIRBs are located through triangulation by LUTs through signals from several satellites. The legacy mode is still supported by Galileo because many EPIRBs are still in use. However, because of many false alerts it has been decided by CO- SPAS-SARSAT [8.6.8] that, as from February 1, 2009, only the 406 MHz band will remain for SAR while the other distress frequencies of 121.5 MHz and 243 MHz used so far will no longer be supported.

Intermediate processes must be reviewed and accepted at formal reviews and milestones. Depar- tures from this understanding lead in most cases to work overloads as well as to resource and cost problems.. ,True,2
What must be ensured regarding products or services at the conclusion of their implementation stages?,The Value-Adding Process: Value-adding proces- ses must be clearly defined. It must be assured that products or services comply with requirements and are acceptable by the customer at the end of the implementation process for all life cycles. Wrong or insufficient understanding often leads to undesirable results with consequences for costs and the schedule. Overdesign caused by the designer’s own ideas has to be avoided.. ,True,2

What is the role of cost estimation relationships in parametric analysis?,Parametric analysis requires careful consideration of costs as well as technical and programmatic in- formation. This makes it possible to identify cost drivers and to develop cost models. This approach effectively correlates labor costs and personnel with parameters describing the product to be costed. This correlation leads to regression formulas known as cost estimation relationships (CERs).

The contractor also receives a negotiated profit according to the contract specifics (fixed profit fee or profit percentage). Project risks and inflation are typically borne and paid by the customer. Consequently, for this contract type the cost per product can grow considerably since the effort to achieve a result is reimbursed, in contrast to payment for a completed product in fixed price contracts. ",True,2
What advantages do cost reimbursement contracts provide in managing project changes?,"On the other hand, this contract type allows adjustments in the project plan to be easily handled by redirecting effort among WPs. If required, the customer is able to exercise direct control over the work program through this mechanism. This flexibility in project execution renders cost reimbursement contracts very suitable for major development or state-of-the-art projects, where typically neither the product nor the work plan can be defined up-front in detail and changes are likely.

What is the primary factor that influences cost management across different contract categories?,"The key to cost control in all contract types is the definition of the percentage of work complete. It de- termines the actual work finished in a WP versus the overall planned work for that WP. Even though this definition is sound and clear there are some practical problems involved in measuring appropriately the finished work portion. For example, many projects determine the percentage of work completed via the ratio of work hours spent over hours scheduled. ",True,2
What is a potential consequence of relying on a manager's subjective judgment for work assessment?,"This appears reliable at first sight but, as is commonly known, effort is not strictly correlated with progress, which may lead to skewed reporting. Even worse is the common practice of taking the task manager’s subjec- tive judgment on the achievement as input for work complete. This bears a high risk of biasing the report, since even the most experienced manager is optimistic about assessing the work status. ",True,2
What challenges arise from discrepancies between reported status and actual conditions in project management?,"Moreover, the perspec- tives on achievement may diverge dramatically between customer and contractor. Lessons learned confirm that such methods do not qualify for rigorous cost control as they are systematically inaccurate because of devi- ations between status report and reality.. ",True,3
What does physical progress measurement quantify in project management?,"To overcome this problem, a reliable and objective method for determining work progress must be found. The solution is to introduce physical progress mea- surement for each WP that is to be monitored for cost control purposes.

In other words, changing the product specification — even if required for a good reason — formally leads to renegotiation and potentially to price increases.",True,2
What is the impact of vague product definitions on project adjustments and cost management in advanced space initiatives?,"Considering space projects, in mostly new de- velopments or state-of-the-art projects trying to advance technological limits, the specific definition of a product has to be vague by nature. This prepares the ground for repeated product adjustments, chan- ge requests and CCNs with their cost increases. It is obvious that such an environment requires good and systematic cost control.",True,3
What determines the project costs for different phases in fixed price contracts?,"Generally in fixed price contracts, payments are inked to project milestones, forming thereby so-called payment milestones. Typically, project reviews (SRR, PDR, CDR, etc.) or handovers of deliverables are best suited to serve as payment milestones because they represent the finalization of a dedicated project phase. The project costs are determined for these project phases using the cost baseline, and the respective amount of the scheduled cost is allocated to the pay- ment milestone representing that phase. This amount may need to be supplemented with procurement costs or long-lead items requiring advance purchase.. ",True,2
What is the primary responsibility of the cost controller regarding physical progress and payment milestones?,"In this setup the main task of cost control is to substantiate that physical progress at the payment milestone is in line with the schedule, thus justifying the payment of the predefined amount according to the cost baseline. If any deviations occur, the cost controller has the task of identifying corrective actions and reporting them to project management for further implementation. Other tasks include the assessment of contract change requests (CCRs), preparing the respective negotiations, documenting cost changes due to CCNs, and continuously updating the esti- mated cost at project completion, keeping the project manager informed of the overall project cost whenever a change is made..

",True,2
What is the main purpose of performance analysis in regard to cost management?,"In earned value analysis (EVA) a well-proven performance measurement method exists to assist the cost control process in its task of identifying deviations. The purpose of EVA is to determine at a predefined cut-off date (e.g., the end of the month) the value of work performed. This makes it possible to compare in an integrated way scheduled work, ac- complished work and actual effort. In order to carry out such an integrated assessment all these parameters need common metrics. They are therefore expressed in cost units.. ",True,4
What is the purpose of designating control accounts in the EVA method?,"The EVA method of performance measurement can be scaled to any project level, namely single ac- tivities, WPs or the entire project. In large projects it is best practice to limit the effort for the controlling process by selecting a typical subset of work packages on which EVA is carried out. These are designated as control accounts (CAs). They are also used to delegate responsibility in the controlling process to different contractor levels by designating control account ma- nagers (CAMs). The three control values required for EVA are determined for every CA at every cut-off date. They are described as follows:. ",True,3
What does the budgeted cost of work scheduled represent in project management?,"e Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS): Planned cost for work (activity, WP, project) at cut-off date according to the cost baseline.",True,2
How is the earned value determined at the cut-off date in project management?,"e Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or earned value: Budgeted cost for the work (activity, WP, project) actually accomplished at the cut- off date. This value generally is calculated as the percentage of work complete multiplied by the budgeted total cost for a work unit:",True,3
How is project efficiency assessed using the values derived from BCWP and ACWP?,"BCWP = % work complete x budgeted total coste Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP): Actual cost incurred for the work (activity, WP, project) accomplished at cut-off date.2/25/09 3:37:20 PM CHO9.indd Sec1:806With these values, project efficiency, schedule perfor-mance and cost performance are easily determined bycalculating the following indices:",True,4

How is the estimate at completion calculated in relation to the cost and schedule performance indices?,"© Cost performance index (CPI) = BCWP/ACWP = 1 is good (cost right on plan)The performance indices influence the originally planned project cost, denominated budget at com- pletion (BAC). An estimate of the total project cost — the estimate at completion (EAC) — related to SPI and CPI is given by the following equation:Estimate at completion (EAC) = ACWP + (BAC — BCWP)/(CPI x SPI)",True,3

What are the key aspects involved in overseeing and directing space project operations?,9 Management of Space Projects,True,2
What formula is used to calculate the estimate to complete in project management?,Another very important parameter for project ma- nagement is the cost required to complete the project or the estimate to complete (ETC). This information can be computed via the following relationship:e Estimate to complete (ETC) = EAC - ACWP,True,2
How is the efficiency needed to complete a project within budget calculated in project management?,"If the project manager aims at completing the project within the original cost budget BAC, then the effi- ciency required to do so is calculated as the ratio of remaining work divided by remaining budget:",True,3
How is the To-complete performance index calculated in relation to budget and work performed?,"e To-complete performance index (TCPI) = (BAC — BCWP)/(BAC — ACWP)For example, if 25% of the work has been performed with 50% of the budget (CPI = 0.5), then the subse- quent TCPI has to increase to 1.5.",True,3
What does the TCPI indicate about project planning realism?,"The difference between the TCPI and the demons- trated CPI is a good indicator for judging whether the planning is realistic. In the example given it is very unlikely that the efficiency can be improved from 50% to 150%, rendering the planning unrealistic.",True,3
What are the three key components typically displayed as cumulative cost curves in EVA?,"A common way to communicate the findings of an EVA is to display the cost baseline (BCWS), the actual cost (ACWP) and the earned value (BCWP) as cumulative cost curves.

What is the purpose of documenting analyses concerning reasons for budget variances in projects?,e Documentation of “lessons learned” (analysis of root causes for cost deviations and their docu- mentation).,True,2
What are the main activities during the final phase of a financial oversight process for project management?,"The end of a cost management process is characteri- zed by the so-called project close-out, documenting lessons learned and formulating best practices for co- ming projects. This last phase of the cost management process is often neglected, mostly for organizational reasons. The project team is dissolving, new tasks lie ahead and obligations to exchange information may have ceased with the end of the contract.. ",True,3
Why is documenting experiences essential for future project enhancements?,"It should, however, be noted that a proper project close-out is of utmost importance for cost manage- ment, since all processes, methods and models need verification, calibration and feedback. Only if expe- riences are recorded, documented and exploited are future improvements likely.",True,2
What is compared during cost management after project completion?,"Therefore, the task of cost management after completing a project lies in a comparison of the ac- tual cost at completion (CAC) to former budgets and estimates, followed by a discrepancy analysis in case major differences are found. Actual cost and findings resulting from this analysis are generally required to calibrate cost estimating models in order to improve their accuracy.",True,2
What are the two types of causes for cost increases identified in analysis?,"In addition, the discrepancy analysis is also used to identify causes for cost increases in a systematic manner. Causes for cost increases are typically stochastic (e.g., test failure, accident, loss of contractor) or systematic (e.g., late change in requirements, adverse market effects and procurement policies, or underestimated comple- xities). In the latter case they should be documented as lessons learned and communicated to the project organizers so they can be avoided in the future.. ",True,2
What potential issue arises in the aerospace industry due to increased mergers leading to reduced competition?,"9.3.6.1 Virtual CompetitionThe general trend to mergers in the aerospace industry leads to conglomeration and less competition in this industrial sector. There are already some areas, espe- cially in the space business, where only one supplier exists, posing a risk of monopoly and high prices detrimental to space projects.",True,2
What approach is described as confronting a monopoly supplier with a well-founded cost estimate?,"Utilizing the cost estimating capacity of good cost management could help to overcome such detrimen- tal monopoly situations. The idea is to confront a monopoly supplier with a robust cost estimate for its product which urges the supplier to defend its price. This is believed to instigate the effect of price compe- tition, possibly leading to lower prices. This approach is tagged “virtual competition.”. ",True,2

The reason is the ability to respond quickly with a quotation to an announcement of opportunity/RFQ.,True,3
What benefits arise from aligning and auditing cost models between a provider and a client?,"If parametric cost models are harmonized and audited between the customer and the supplier, they make feasible both real-time cost proposals by the suppliers and real-time proposal evaluation by the customer. In other words, the time and cost involved in presenting and evaluating a proposal could be dra- matically decreased. In addition, useless discussions about different perspectives on determining work effort could be avoided because the whole proposal is based on objective, physical design parameters (mass, thrust, data rate, area, etc.)..

For the state this entails liability even if the damage was caused by private activity. ",True,3
What legal obligation does the state have regarding activities conducted by individuals within its jurisdiction?,"Therefore, the state must ensure that it receives information about all activities carried out from its territory or by its natural or juridical persons. At best the state will scrutinize the activity with regard to safety aspects and authorize as well as supervise it. At the same time the state has to establish a legal basis for indemni- fication against the private actor which caused the damage, because international liability according to Art.

The state which operated a satellite for several years is still liable if it hands over the satellite to an operator under foreign jurisdiction, after which the satellite causes damage. ",True,3
What must a state receive regarding a private satellite operator's intention to sell to another operator abroad?,"This seems to be unfair at first glance. But states can agree among themselves on an internal indemnification [9.4.15], [9.4.16]. If, in the latter case, the satellite was not operated by the state, but by a private entity, the state needs to receive information about the intention of that operator to sell the satellite to another operator abroad so that it can then enter into such an agree- ment with the state which exercises jurisdiction over the new operator..

Which article of the Liability Convention excludes claims against launching states for damages to their nationals?,"Because the aforementioned rules are based on a treaty among states and because they intend to pro- tect third parties, Art. VII of the Liability Convention excludes the applicability of this additional possibility to claim against the launching state(s) for damages to nationals of the launching state as well as for damages to persons who are participating in the operation of the space object which caused the damage. These per- sons may still pursue a claim for damages according to national laws or according to their contracts.. ",True,2
What is the relationship between multiple launching states and the launch event as outlined in international space law?,For a space object there is typically more than one launching state. This is based on the linkage of the participating of states with the launch event — as specified in Art. VII of the Outer Space Treaty and Art.,True,3
What establishes a state's liability in the context of launching a space object?,"(c) of the Liability Convention. A state is liable if it launches the space object, if it procures the launching of the space object, or if the space object is launched rom its territory or facility. If any of these criteria apply, the state is a launching state. For a German satellite launched, for example, from French Guiana (which is a French overseas department and there- ore French territory) both France and Germany are aunching states. ",True,3
What does the Liability Convention state regarding the responsibility of launching states for damage caused?,The number of launching states in- creases correspondingly in international cooperation projects. The Liability Convention reflects this in Art. V: all launching states are jointly and severally liable. A state to which or to whose nationals damage was caused can address one of the launching states and claim the full damage from that state. This launching state must then internally claim compensation from the other launching state(s).

What is the significance of frequency bands in satellite communication?,"An operator needs frequencies within certain frequen- cy bands (e.g., C- or Ku-band) in order to command a satellite as well as to transmit data between the satellite and its ground segments. Usable frequencies are a limited resource for technical reasons. Therefore, there is a need to coordinate the use of frequencies.",True,2
What is the role of the ITU in frequency coordination in outer space?,"Such coordination is two tiered. First, the use of frequencies by the ground station has to be coordina- ted and assigned on a national level. Second, the use of frequencies in outer space has to be coordinated and assigned internationally by the ITU for its member states; the member state can then assign the right to use such frequencies to an operator. This internatio- nal coordination and assignment is dealt with in the following section.. ",True,2
What organization is responsible for frequency allocation by ground stations?,The use of frequencies by ground stations requires prior allocation by the Federal Network Agency. The procedure of allocation is laid down in $55 of the Telecommunications Act.,True,2
What type of license is required to transmit data from a satellite to a ground station?,Simple reception of telecommunication satellite signals as well as the use of very small satellite sen- ders and receivers are typically approved by a general license. They can be set up and used without prior allocation of frequencies. But a specific license is necessary to use frequencies in order to command a satellite as well as to transmit data from a satellite to a ground station.,True,2
What must be included in an application for frequency use regarding service and technology?,"The person intending to use such frequencies has to apply at the Federal Network Agency. The applica- tion should specify the service and type of network, the technology and the area in which the frequency will be used.

The licensee also must report sub- sequent changes in personal circumstances, such as changes of name, address or shareholder structure.",True,2
Who manages frequency allocation for ground segments in relation to satellite operators?,"As ground segments are often operated by a party other than the operator of the satellite, the person to whom frequencies are allocated for the ground segment does not need to be the same person to whom frequen- cies are allocated for use in outer space. Cooperation between the ground and space segments is regulated by a treaty among the parties, see Section 9.4.2.3.",True,2
What is required for a satellite operator to use frequencies in outer space?,"Transfer of Orbit and Frequency Usage Rights While the allocation of frequencies according to §55 of the Telecommunications Act regulates the use of frequencies by the ground segment, the use of fre- quencies in outer space (e.g., to command a satellite) requires additional approval. The operator of the satellite has to apply at the Federal Network Agency for a transfer of orbit and frequency usage rights. ",True,2
"What organization grants usage rights for satellites, requiring international coordination of frequency use?","These usage rights are allocated by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to the member states (in this case, Germany). This approval is neces- sary in addition to the allocation of frequencies for the ground station, because the use of frequencies by satellites needs international coordination, which is handled according to the public international rules of the ITU [9.4.30]..

What must occur before a private operator can utilize transferred orbital and frequency rights in Germany?,"The Federal Agency then applies for the needed obit and frequency at the ITU with the goal of having the orbit and frequency usage rights transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany. The Federal Network Agency can permit the private operator to exercise these rights only after these orbit and frequency usage rights have been transferred to Germany; that is, after completion of the ITU procedure.. ",True,3
What must be included in an operator's application to the Federal Network Agency for ITU rights?,"According to the procedures of Administrative Order 8/2005, the private operator has to apply at the Federal Network Agency so that the Federal Network Agency can apply for these rights at the ITU. The application of the operator has to contain information about the applicant, explanations of how international coordination is to be assured, acceptance of the obliga- tion to comply with ITU regulations, confirmation of a fiduciary account or a bank guarantee in the amount of the expected ITU fees, and a concept for the use of the frequencies.

Who is responsible for coordinating frequencies with ITU member states after objections are filed?,"The ITU collects and forwards to the Federal Net- work Agency these objections to the frequency appli- cation. The Agency is now called on to coordinate the frequencies with those ITU member states which have filed an appeal. The responsibility for this coor- dination is transferred by the Agency to the satellite operator who has applied for the frequency since the outcome of coordination has a considerable effect on the detailed system design, the operational running of the satellite network and economic aspects. ",True,1
What role does the Agency play when an applicant cannot execute ITU procedures?,"Neverthe- less, the Agency assists the applicant in effecting inter- national coordination insofar as the applicant lacks entitlement to carry out the ITU procedures, given the private law status of the applicant. In particular, the Agency forwards any document prepared by the applicant to the ITU or other member states “on behalf of Germany.” The Agency assesses these documents for conformity with ITU rules and regulations as well as with regard to the public interests involved.. ",True,2
What might be required to ensure compatibility with other satellite systems during international coordination?,"In practice, the international coordination lasts several months (sometimes even years), depending on the rights which have to be coordinated. In addition, the applicant has to be aware that the international coordination might necessitate changes in the satel- ite system design in order to achieve compatibility with other satellite systems. This calls for a flexible mission plan.",True,3
What body maintains the Master International Frequency Register for satellite systems?,"As soon as the international coordination is fina- ized, the Agency notifies the results to the ITU, sup- plying the final satellite system design. The Agency is assisted by the applicant. The ITU finally enters the satellite systems (especi- ally the telecommunication links) in the Master nternational Frequency Register. From then on, the frequency usage is protected by international aw and must be respected by all ITU member states (including their nationals). The Federal Republic of Germany receives the right to use the orbit and the requency.. ",True,2
What is required for the transfer of usage rights regarding satellite systems in Germany?,"The German satellite operator may now apply at the Agency, which holds this right of usage on behalf of Germany, for a transfer of these usage rights. The application must be filed at least three months in advance of the scheduled launch of the satellite sys- tem.

What must an applicant prove regarding the management of satellite operations?,"The rights to use the orbit and the frequency will be transferred to the applicant if the frequencies are available, compatible with other frequencies used or filed, and do not contravene public interest. The applicant has to prove that indeed both the orbit as well as the frequency are used. The applicant also has to prove that the transmission does not cause inter- ference, that there is operational control over the space segment, and that competent personnel are employed. The applicant finally has to assure proper operation of the satellite system.. ",True,3
What information must the applicant provide immediately after satellite launch?,"If the launch of the satellite system into orbit is postponed, the applicant has to inform the Agency as soon as possible. Right after launch the applicant has to inform the Agency about the launch as well as the final orbital parameters. The applicant must also register the space segment as a space object.",True,3
What limitations exist on the duration of rights for using orbit and frequency?,"The transfer of the rights to use the orbit and frequency is limited to the expected lifetime of the satellite system. The tables of transmitter frequen- cy tolerances and maximum permitted spurious emission power levels have to be followed. In case of interference with other satellite systems or inter- ference with other transmissions, the Agency may restrict or prohibit the use of the frequency. It also may revoke the transfer of rights to use this orbit and frequency.. ",True,2
What reserves must be planned for the decommissioning of satellites to meet international standards?,"The operation of the satellite for which orbit and frequency rights were transferred must be planned so that there are enough reserves (of energy, fuel and functionality) to carry out decommissioning orbital maneuvers in accordance with international standards. Operating requirements may be imposed on the party enjoying the right of use in order to achieve compliance with international standards on the avoidance of space debris.. ",True,3
What are the current fees associated with the ITU application and the transfer of usage rights?,"There are charges for both the ITU application and the transfer of the right of use. In addition to the fees of (currently) €500 to €3500 according to the Frequency Fee Ordinance of the Agency, the applicant also has to pay the expenses for the ITU procedures (currently 570 Swiss francs for the advan- ced publication, 5560 to 33 467 Swiss francs for the coordination and 15 910 to 57 920 Swiss francs for the notification)..

This is usually not relevant for space industries, research centers and universities.",True,2
What types of goods are included in the category of dual-use technology?,"It is more relevant that dual-use technology also needs to be licensed. Many space goods and space technologies are dual-use items. Dual-use techno- logy refers to all goods (including data processing programs as well as technology) which may be used for both military and civil purposes. Because there are no launch sites on German territory, space goods developed or assembled in Germany typically have to be brought outside of Germany for launching them into outer space. ",True,3
What types of communication items are classified under the dual-use items list?,"In order to know whether or not a specific good is deemed to be a dual-use item, the export list (Part I, Section C) has to be studied.

What exemptions apply to bidders regarding export control licenses during procurement tenders?,"Technical knowledge may also be exported in research and development pro- jects with non-European industries, research centers or universities as well as in training and schooling programs. It may also be exported in the exchange of researchers, engineers, doctoral students and students. Technical documents may also be transferred in or- der to enter into insurance contracts. In contrast, if technical documents are transferred in the context of a procurement tender, the bidder is exempted from applying for an export control license.. ",True,1
What factors determine the necessity of an export control license for dual-use items?,"The need to apply for an export control license for dual-use items depends only on whether or not the good is listed — irrespective of which state the good is going to be exported to. Only goods brought into a member state of the EU are not subject to an export control license. In exceptional cases there is a need to apply for an export license for goods which are not listed, if the person intending to export the good has indications that it will have a military end use, for ABC weapons, for missiles for such weapons or for nuclear purposes..

What is the indirect consequence of re-exporting US goods without permission when integrated into foreign satellites?,"from Germany into a third state. This is the case, for example, if a component exported from the USA to Germany is being integrated into a satellite in Germa- ny and this satellite is then sent to a launch site, for example, in French Guiana or Kazakhstan. Although the re-export of US goods without permission by the USA cannot be a reason for infringement of German export control regulations, there is an indirect con- sequence. ",True,3
What is the significance of indicating the intended states for re-exporting goods imported from the USA?,"By non-compliance indirect (economic) pressure may be put on the German entity regarding future cooperation with US industry.

What international agreement requires states to authorize private space activities?,"License to Launch and Operate a Space Object Those states which have ratified the Outer Space Treaty have committed themselves to establishing national procedures to authorize and supervise non- governmental activities in outer space, Art. VI (2) Outer Space Treaty. In any case, the operation and control of a satellite, a probe, a platform or a space station is an activity in outer space. Considering the practice of states, also such activities have to be understood as being undertaken “in” outer space if they are only partly undertaken in outer space but directed toward exploration or use of outer space. ",True,4
What types of launches are generally excluded from being considered governmental activities?,"This includes launching activities.

An activity is deemed to be “non-governmental” if it is undertaken by a private company, a research center or a university.. ",True,3
What must a state establish before the launch of a private satellite into space?,"Consequently, a state has to implement a proce- dure to authorize and supervise activities in outer space, when, for example, the first satellite operated by a private company or university is going to be launched into outer space. Such a procedure may be established in the context of already existing adminis- trative procedures (e.g., as a condition to the decision to give a grant to the project of the operator). ",True,3
What type of partnership can exist between a government and a private company for satellite operation?,"It can also be part of a contractual relationship between this operator and the government, which might be the case, for example, if the government is commissioning the task to operate the satellite to a private company (e.g., in the context of a public—private partnership)..

This would be the most transparent approach for the private operator, research center or university and provide the most legal security.",True,3
What alternatives exist for the German government to authorize space activities without legislation?,"There is no legislation in force in Germany which can deal with the authorization of space activities. But some private companies and universities already exist which operate satellites in outer space, and also a German launch service provider launches from a launch site abroad, so that the German government needs to ensure authorization of these activities by means other than legislation.

They have to follow the same obligations which have been dealt with under Section 9.4.1.1.. ",True,2
What are the obligations of a launching state regarding liability for damage caused by space objects?,"In the first instance, the obligation to ensure safety of an activity in order to avoid damage and liability has a regulatory as well as a social character. But Germany also has a strong self-interest in avoiding damage in the course of an activity in outer space. This is because Germany is liable as a launching state for damage caused by a space object to a third party according to Art. VII of the Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention.

Full international liability exists, in addition to the direct liability of the person who caused the damage to the person damaged, according to national tort law. ",True,3
What is required from the operator to ensure safety during the authorization process?,"This was dealt with under Section 9.4.1.1. Therefore, it is part of the authorization procedure for the operator to demonstrate its reliability, ca- pability and technical qualification also in order to avoid such damage. In addition, the state ensures the safety of the products used (e.g., on the basis of technical standards such as ISO, DIN or ECSS). Finally, compulsory third-party liability insurance is required..

What are the three principal aspects a state must consider regarding liability for space activities?,"Besides implementing its international responsi- bility, according to Art. VI of the Outer Space Treaty, and besides ensuring the avoidance of liability, a state has a third aspect of importance to consider. This is also out of self-interest to some extent. Based on an application for authorization, a state can assess whether or not it is the only responsible state for the activity to be authorized, or whether other states may be liable for the object (satellite) which is used in such activity.

This is because the state, being also the (liable) launching state, will remain the liable launching state also after the purchase, as the liability is linked to the moment when the launch took place. ",True,3
What is the requirement for negotiations if damage occurs due to a foreign operator?,"If the new (foreign) operator causes damage, Germany remains liable, although Ger- many cannot supervise the foreign operator. Therefore, the launching state has to enter into negotiations with the state which is responsible for the activity for which the satellite was purchased. That foreign state should agree to assume liability inter partes.. ",True,2
What must a satellite operator consider aside from national legislation?,"Operators of a satellite (or the person who wants to undertake a space activity) should take a close look at not only the national legislation, but also the foreign authorization procedures. This is especially important in the context of increasing international cooperation, also because a German operator always has to launch its satellite from abroad. Even if the German operator does not apply for the foreign authorization, the mission concept can be influenced by the regulations which the foreign partners and contractors have to follow.. ",True,2
How many states have formal national legislation regarding outer space activities as of the given date?,"Formal national legislation with regard to outer space activities exists as of 12 states [9.4.37]:e USA (49 USC 701 Commercial Space Launch Activities; CFR 14 III 400 Commercial Space Transportation)e Norway (Act on Launching Objects from Norwe- gian Territory etc. into Outer Space, 1969)e Sweden (Act on Space Activities, 1982; Decree on Space Activities, 1982)",True,1

What is the primary motivation for implementing national legislation regarding space activities?,"Authorization and supervision of non-governmental activities is often the motivation as well as the essential reason for enacting national space legislation. But most states have connected the legal basis for a regis- tration system with specific liability issues, especially rules on indemnifying the state which has been held liable as a launching state according to Art. VII of the Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention. These aspects will be dealt with separately in Sections 9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.4.. ",True,2
What are the regulatory considerations for classifying space vehicles as aircraft?,Authorization of Space Vehicles as Aircraft,True,4
What classification does the Air Traffic Act give to space vehicles while they are in space?,"As long as there is no national legislation on autho- rizing space activities in force in Germany, operators should always take aviation legislation into conside- ration. This is because the legislator has rudimentarily provided for the applicability of this legislation to space activities: §1 para. 2 Air Traffic Act states that space vehicles, rockets and similar objects are consi- dered as aircraft, as long as they are in space.. ",True,2
What is the legal framework for applying air traffic regulations to non-terrestrial vehicles?,"This would be the basis for applying regulations of the Air Traffic Act, the Air Traffic Regulation and the Air Traffic Approval Regulation also to space vehicles.",True,3
At what altitude does German airspace terminate according to various expert opinions?,"But the fiction established by $1 para. 2 of the Air Traffic Act only applies as long as the space vehicle, rocket or similar object is in German airspace. This airspace ends at an altitude of something in between 83 and 100 km, depending on which expert opinion one follows. Some experts argue that airspace ends at the so-called Karman line, which is where the airspace can still slightly support aircraft and where orbits of space vehicles are also possible (physical approach). ",True,3
What is the proposed regulatory limit mentioned for space vehicle operations?,"Others argue for a regulatory limit of 100 km. But a space vehicle is very unlikely to cross German airspace, as there is no launch site either in Germany or in its neighboring countries. Hence, the fiction is almost without any practical applicability.. ",True,2

What type of license might an operator need for operating a space vehicle in German airspace?,"In case there should one day be an activity of a space vehicle in German airspace, the fiction would apply. Nevertheless, many regulations in the Air Traffic Acts are not apt to apply to space activities. A space vehicle does not need to be certified according to §2 of the Air Traffic Act in combination with §1 Air Traffic Approval Regulation. But the operator might need a flight crew license according to $4 Air Traffic Act, an approval for ascent according to $16 Air Traffic Or- der, as well as an approval to leave German airspace according to §2 para. 4 Air Traffic Act..

What is required when public telecommunication services are provided through satellites?,"Notification of Telecommunication NetworksAs soon as public telecommunication services are provided via satellites, notification is required. This is in addition to notification regarding the frequency assignment and the transfer of rights to use the orbit and frequency. Notification is made to the Federal Network Agency in accordance with §6 of the Tele- communication Act.",True,2
What identification details must be included in a notification from an operator or service provider?,"The notification has to include information which can identify the operator or service provider. This contains, for example, its number in the commercial register, physical address, a short description of the network or service, as well as the estimated date of the commencement of service.",True,1
What is required for authorizing a remote sensing space system to begin operations?,Authorization to Operate an Advanced Remote Sensing Satellite System,True,3
What defines a remote sensing satellite system as 'advanced' according to the German Satellite Data Security Act?,"On December 1, 2007 the German Act to safeguard security interests in the distribution of remote sensing satellite data (Satellite Data Security Act) came into force [9.4.38]. According to this Act the operator of an advanced remote sensing satellite system has to apply for authorization. A remote sensing satellite system is deemed to be “advanced” if the system is able to generate data of high information content. ",True,2
What factors influence the amount of information content in remote sensing data?,"This information content is determined according to the spatial resolution, spectral coverage, number of spectral channels, etc. The exact technical limits are determined in the Remote Sensing Satellite Regulation [9.4.39].. ",True,2
What steps must be taken before launching a remote sensing satellite system in relation to governmental approval?,The operator of such a remote sensing system has to apply for authorization at the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (BAFA) prior to the launch of the system. The BAFA evaluates whether the operation of the remote sensing satellite system9 Management of Space Projects,True,2
What security measure must operators implement regarding access to satellite system control rooms?,"might endanger German security or foreign policy interests. Therefore, the BAFA checks the reliability of the operator as well as the operational security. The operator has to ensure that the satellite system cannot be commanded and data cannot be accessed by un- authorized persons. Furthermore, the operator has to ensure that no unauthorized person has admission to the rooms from which the satellite system is operated and which are used to store and handle any associated data, and that no unauthorized person has access to relevant facilities therein. Persons having such access must have a security clearance.. ",True,2
What is required for an individual to distribute advanced remote sensing satellite data?,"The BAFA is supported by the Federal Office of Information Security.The Act will be supplemented by an ordinance on fees, which has not yet been published.Permission to Act as a Data DistributorThe Satellite Data Security Act also requires a person who intends to distribute advanced remote sensing satellite data to apply for permission. This permission is granted by the BAFA.",True,2
Who is responsible for obtaining permission from the operator in the data distribution process?,"A data distributor is anybody who circulates such data for the very first time to customers. The operator of a satellite system can also be a data distributor if it circulates data to persons who have not themselves received permission to act as a data distributor. Usually the operator will transfer the right to use the satellite data to a data distributor, who in turn will circulate the data to customers. In this case, only the distributor needs to apply for permission.. ",True,2
What criteria does BAFA use to evaluate data distributors for security purposes?,"The BAFA evaluates (similar to the evaluations to authorize an advanced remote sensing satellite system) whether the distribution might endanger German security and foreign policy interests and whether the data can be transferred on a secure basis. This includes ascertaining the reliability of the data distributor. The distributor also has to ensure that no unauthorized person has admission to the rooms relevant to the storage, handling and distribution of the data and that no unauthorized person has access to relevant facilities therein. Persons having such access must have a security clearance.. ",True,2
What is the status of an individual distributing data without registration as a distributor?,A person who intends to distribute data is not obliged to apply for registration as a data distributor. In that case the person is dealt with as a (simple) customer. This has the consequence that the person2/25/09 3:37:29 PM 9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities,True,1

This will be described in the following section.",True,3
What factors must be considered when determining the terms of remote sensing data dissemination?,License to Distribute Remote Sensing Data with High Informational Content,True,3
What is required for a distributor to circulate sensitive remote sensing data for the first time?,"Besides the authorization to operate an advanced re- mote sensing satellite system and besides the approval to act as a data distributor, the core regulation of the Satellite Data Security Act requires the distributor to apply for a license to distribute remote sensing data with high informational content (if the request for data is sensitive). This license is necessary for every distributor who circulates data for the very first time to customers.. ",True,2
What does the sensitivity check evaluate regarding data distribution?,"On the first level, the data distributor who intends to distribute data to any persons who are not them- selves registered as a data distributor has to perform a sensitivity check. This sensitivity check is related to the request for data (and not related only to the contents of the data). The sensitivity check assesses whether the intended distribution of the data might endanger German security and foreign policy in- terests. This assessment is made according to the following criteria:. ",True,4
What parameters are essential to specify regarding the data's origin and transmission?,"e Technical parameters of the data.e The sensed territory.e The time of generation of the data, the time of delivery and the person to be supplied.e The ground segments to which the data is to be sent.",True,2
What entities should be considered in the data access assessment?,The assessment should consider the person who requested the data as well as any persons who are intended to have access to the data. The assessment is made according to criteria specified in the Satellite Data Security Regulation. These criteria can be auto- matically assessed by the data distributor.,True,2
What triggers the need for the distributor to decide on a transaction license?,The data distributor can continue the transaction if the sensitivity check reveals no endangerment of German security or foreign policy interests. Not until the check reveals sensitivity does the distributor have to decide whether to decline the transaction or apply for a license from the BAFA. Here an administrative procedure starts. The BAFA will ascertain whether the transaction might indeed endanger national security or foreign policy interests.. ,True,2
What factors are considered when evaluating applications related to data transactions?,"The license procedure is supposed to be rapid, and if possible concluded within a month of the date of application. Many applications are decided within a much shorter period. The only criteria against which the application can be assessed concern whether the transaction of the data would indeed endanger German security or foreign policy interests.",True,2
Which two countries have advanced remote sensing satellite systems not exclusively for military applications?,"Similar legislation exits in the USA [9.4.40] and Canada [9.4.41], [9.4.42]. Only these two states cur- rently have advanced remote sensing satellite systems not solely used for military purposes.",True,2
What specific funding options are available for conducting exploratory activities in outer space?,Particular Case: Grants for Space Missions,True,3
What type of financial aid is provided under the national space program that requires state support?,"Not only licenses but also grants establish a legal relationship to the state. Grants are subsidies which are given within the framework of the national space program [9.4.43] for space missions which are in the national interest and which would not be possible without a state subsidy. The legal basis for grants is to be found in $§23, 44 of the Federal Budget Act.",True,3
What is the maximum reimbursement percentage for industry missions according to the European Commission?,Grants are usually approved for projects and are subject to reimbursement. If the mission is within the domain of basic research it can be subsidized fully; if it is an industry mission it can be subsidized up to 50%. Precompetitional developments may be subsi- dized up to 25%. The European Commission allows supplements for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as for cooperation projects.,True,2
What essential components must be included in a grant application for the German Space Agency?,"Anybody interested in applying for a grant may contact the German Space Agency within the German Aerospace Center for advice on the feasibility and prospects of an application. They may then apply for a grant. The application should include among other things a description of the project, a financial budget and a preliminary costing.",True,2
What criteria does the Space Agency evaluate for applicant creditworthiness?,"The Space Agency will decide on the application on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Tech- nology. It assesses the creditworthiness of the applicant with respect to the costs covered by the applicant, the budget in the context of grants, the financing plan and the feasibility of the project. It should be borne in mind that a grant is excluded if the applicant has already started the project.. ",True,2
What metrics are used to assess progress in a monitored project?,"The project is monitored by the Space Agency whi- le it is being carried out by comparing the progress to the original work, time and budget planning.

What type of documents must a grantee submit to confirm appropriate use of grants?,"The Space Agency checks whether the grants are used appropriately. Accordingly, the grantee has to provide supporting documents on a regular basis as well as final documentation on how the grants were used in the project. The Space Agency determines whether the intended purpose of the grant was fulfilled.",True,2
What is mandated regarding the usage of the grant according to the general terms and conditions?,"The decision to give a grant is supplemented by a fixed set of terms and conditions which are not subject to change. For grants based on expenditures, the gran- tee has to follow the general terms and conditions for grants subsidizing a project (ANBest-P) as well as some specific terms and conditions (BNBest-BMBF 98). For grants based on costs, specific terms and conditions exist (NKBF 98). The general terms and conditions mandate economical and cost-effective use of the grant, and how it is to be spent. ",True,2
"What is required regarding contracts for grants over €100,000?","For grants exceeding €100.000, tenders must be sought for all contracts that the grantee intends to conclude in the course of the project, as if the grantee were a public entity. One of the most important terms within the specific terms and conditions is that any intellectual property which might be generated in the course of the project be own- ed by the grantee. Ownership includes the exclusive right of use, but the grantee is obliged to actually use this intellectual property, since it was generated in a project which was financed to some extent with public money, in accord with an exploitation plan drawn up in cooperation with the Space Agency. ",True,2
What is the consequence of publishing intellectual property regarding its patentability?,"The intellectual property must be used for innovation, and the grantee is obliged to file an application for a patent if necessary. Here, the grantee has to be aware that once the intel- lectual property has been published it is no longer a new invention (and thus not patentable).. ",True,2
What is the requirement for objects launched into Earth orbit or beyond regarding their documentation?,"9.4.2.2 Registration of Space ObjectsObjects which are launched into Earth orbit or beyond have to be entered in a national registry. States have assumed the obligation to hold such a registry, see Section 9.4.1.1.",True,2
What organization manages the registry for aircraft in Germany?,"The Federal Republic of Germany has established such a registry. It is an annex to the Aircraft Registry which is maintained by the German Aviation Author- ity (Luftfahrt-Bundesamt). As of June 2008, 31 space objects were registered in the German registry.",True,2
What is the governing body responsible for registering government-owned space objects in Germany?,Space objects owned by the government are re- gistered on the initiative of the German Aviation9 Management of Space Projects,True,2
What is the current requirement for registering private space objects in Germany?,Authority or on notice of the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs or the Space Agency within the Ger- man Aerospace Centre. Private space objects are so far registered by the voluntary notice of the owner or operator. An obligation to provide information for registration to the national aviation authority does not exist within German legislation. Aircraft are registered according to §3 of the Air Traffic Act in combination with $14 of the Air Traffic Approval Regulation. ,True,1
What is excluded from the Air Traffic Approval Regulation according to section 14?,"But neither space vehicles nor space objects are menti- oned in $14 of the Air Traffic Approval Regulation. Also, the fiction established by §1 of the Air Traffic Act does not apply to these norms, according to the wording (see above).. ",True,1
What is the nature of the obligation described in Administrative Order 8/2005 regarding launching space objects?,The “obligation” specified by Administrative Order 8/2005 in the context of the transfer of orbit and frequency rights (see above) to give notice of a space object which is to be launched into orbit to the avia- tion authority can be regarded as a request for infor- mation only. This is because such an Administrative Order cannot constitute a formal legal basis for such an obligation.,True,2
What is advised regarding communication with aviation authorities concerning space objects?,"Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to give notice of a space object to the aviation authority on a voluntary basis. This recommendation is based on the implications which registration has for several aspects (see Section 9.4.1.1).",True,1
What type of launched objects are explicitly excluded from being considered space objects in this context?,"The operator/owner should give notice of space objects for which Germany is considered to be a launching state. A space object is an object which is launched (or intended to be launched) for the exploration or use of outer space [9.4.44], [9.4.45]. As the objects need to be launched into an orbit (at least describing one full orbit), these typically include satellites, probes, platforms as well as rocket stages which remain in orbit for a while. On the other hand, sounding rockets and suborbital launch vehicles are not included.. ",True,2
What condition allows Germany to launch privately owned space objects?,"Germany isa launching state also for privately own- ed/operated space objects if the object was launched from German territory or if Germany procured the launch to be carried out. As there are no launch faci- lities within Germany and as the German government does not own a launch site on a foreign territory, the criterion “to procure a launch” is of special importance.

What circumstances obligate Germany's authorization for launching an object?,"government has authorized the activity which is un- dertaken or if Germany was obliged to authorize such activity. It might also be the case if Germany has otherwise contributed to launching the object; for example, by providing grants to the operator/owner, by concluding contracts for the manufacture and/or launch of the object with the owner/operator, or by having a scientific interest in the operation of the object. ",True,3
What does it imply if a German entity operates an object in the context of launching states?,"The notion “to procure” is to be interpreted very widely, as can be seen. If the object is operated by a German national or by a German private entity (company, university, research center), this is an in- dication that Germany also procures the launching of this object and therefore is a launching state.. ",True,2
What information must be submitted to the German Aviation Authority regarding a space object?,"The content of the German registry on space ob- jects resembles the international register held by the (Secretary General of the) United Nations. Therefore, the operator should provide the following informa- tion to the German Aviation Authority: the foreign governments or foreign non-governmental entities involved in the launch and operation of the object (in order to determine the other launching states), an appropriate designation for the object, the date and location of the launch, the basic orbital parameters (nodal period, inclination, apogee, perigee) and the general function of the space object.. ",True,4
What is required for the registration of an object by the aviation authority after launch?,"As the aviation authority only registers the object after the launch took place, simple notification of that fact is sufficient. Nevertheless, it is recommended that the aviation authority be informed in advance. This is because there will always be another launching state in addition to Germany (since the launch has to take place from a foreign territory). Consequently, the German Aviation Authority (ideally in cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs) should enter into agreements with this foreign state. ",True,2
What condition must be met for the German Aviation Authority to register an object in their Aircraft Registry?,"These agreements with other launching states include the determination of which launching state will register the object in its national registry, since only one of the launching states can do this (see Section 9.4.1.1). Only when this agreement has been signed, and only if it identifies Germany as the launching state which registers the object, can the German Aviation Aut- hority register the object in the annex to the Aircraft Registry.. ",True,2
What process must be followed to access the German registry related to aviation?,"The German registry is not public. It can be ac- cessed by applying to the aviation authority. Theapplication has to state the reasons why the infor- mation is needed. Other foreign national registries on space objects are accessible, for example on the Internet [9.4.46], [9.4.47], [9.4.48], [9.4.49].",True,2
What does the Secretary General do with the information from the Federal Ministry regarding space object registration?,"Right after an object is registered in the German registry, the aviation authority informs the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the registration. It provides the information contained in the registry to the Federal Ministry. The Ministry will notify the Secretary General of the United Nations about the registration. The Secretary General (supported by the Office for Outer Space Affairs) will enter this infor- mation in the International Register of Space Objects, see Section 9.4.1.1.. ",True,2
What is the contractual framework that governs a space mission's conception and execution?,9.4.2.3 Contractual Conception of a Space Mission,True,3
What factors influence the necessity and contents of contracts for space missions?,"To prepare and undertake a space mission requires the operator to enter into many contracts. The necessity to conclude a contract as well as the contents and conception of such a contract are specific to each particular case and depend on many factors, such as which parts of the outer space missions are perfor- med by the operator. In the following section some exemplary contracts are described, assuming that the contracting party is the operator/owner of the space object (e.g., satellite). ",True,3

Why is the outlining of primary contractual responsibilities critical in agreements for space object production?,"Specific definition of the main contractual obliga- tions is the core part of a contract on developing and manufacturing a space object. With regard to the obligations of the manufacturer, this is usually done in a very extensive, technical description which is usually annexed to the contract. But the contracting parties may not ignore the fact that the description of the main contractual obligations is an essential and important part of the contract itself and cannot be totally allocated to an annex.

What organizations’ standards are specifically referenced for ensuring quality in space object parts?,"technical descriptions, including those for parts and appliances of space objects. These may be referenced in order to ensure high quality. DIN, CEN, ISO and ECSS standards are of special importance. Some other standards for space projects also exist in the context of AECMA. Such standards are not legal acts and therefore not applicable as such. They have to be agreed upon by the contracting parties. ",True,3
What is the purpose of utilizing standards in industries and space agencies?,"Many space agencies as well as many industries (being themselves represented in Eurospace, the association of Euro- pean space industries have voluntarily committed themselves to use ECSS norms. Standards ensure not only good quality but also functional integrity and compatibility.. ",True,2
What determines if a manufacturer has met its obligations in a contract?,"Whether or not the manufacturer has fulfilled its obligations has to be determined according to the de- scriptions set forth the contract. Note that the parties should agree whether the manufacturer is obliged to render a service to the purchaser, or deliver a result (e.g., hand over a product). This is because, having agreed on a service, the manufacturer has already fulfilled its obligations as soon as it has rendered the service and attempted a positive result. ",True,2
What must the manufacturer deliver if the parties agree on a specific result?,"The parties will agree upon a service contract if the manufacturer is asked to develop a new technology (e.g., to develop a new type of satellite bus). On the other hand, if the parties agree on a result to be achieved, the manufac- turer has to deliver exactly this result. It is no longer sufficient for the manufacturer to attempt to receive a result. The parties will agree upon such a contract if a well-established product is to be manufactured, for example a current type of satellite bus equipped with conventional instruments. ",True,2
What factor determines the fulfillment of obligations by the manufacturer in contract types?,"It is important to be aware of which of the two types of contracts was agreed upon, as this determines the moment when the manufacturer has fulfilled its obligations; that is, the moment when the purchaser can no longer claim subsequent improvement or compensation for damage.. ",True,2
What implications does offering a guarantee impose on a manufacturer's responsibilities and risks?,"A manufacturer may also give a guarantee, going beyond the simple obligation to render a service or deliver a result. But by doing so the manufacturer has to be clear that this implies additional risks. If the manufacturer does not satisfy the guarantee, the manufacturer will be subject to claims for compen- sation, even if it was not responsible for not fulfilling its obligations.",True,2

What are the key elements that should be included regarding payment in a contract?,"The main obligation of the purchaser will be payment of a certain sum of money. The contract should deal not only with the amount to be paid, but also with the means of payment (e.g., fixed price or reimbursement of expenses) and the terms of payment (milestones depending on fixed dates, or performance related) [9.4.50]. The purchaser should monitor fulfillment of the contract in tech- nical reviews.. ",True,2
Who bears the risk of delays in space missions according to contract phases?,"The contracting parties should always stipulate the risk of delays. Space missions are typically long- lasting projects, which intensifies this risk. The parties should allocate the risk of delays in different phases of the contract to the manufacturer or the purchaser. The establishment of different phases makes it easier to amend the contract if necessary.",True,2
What clauses are typically included in contracts that involve sensitive information exchange?,Contracts (especially on research and develop- ment) may specify non-disclosure of information and know-how. This is because both parties frequently have to exchange sensitive information in order to properly fulfill their obligations under the contract. The non-disclosure agreement should have a fixed term; in exceptional cases penalty conditions can be stipulated.,True,3
What aspects of rights related to the outcomes of a project must be mutually understood by the involved parties?,"The parties should furthermore agree on the intel- lectual property rights which might result from the project. This includes patents, source codes, licenses, know-how, etc.Finally the contract should include very general stipulations on the termination of the contract, ar- bitration, jurisdiction, etc.",True,2
What document may be used to outline intentions before a contract is finalized?,"The parties may agree on a letter of intent in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding, option contract, etc. This may be necessary if there is a consi- derable period between the first contacts between the parties and the conclusion of a contract. During this period there may already be negotiations including an exchange of essential information and know-how, which also might give reason for expenditures.. ",True,1
What entities can receive contracts from the German Space Agency for space object production?,"Particular Case: Contract Awarded by the German Aerospace CenterA particular situation arises if the German Space Agency within the German Aerospace Center awards a contract to industry, research organizations or uni- versities to produce a space object.

What types of contract awarding methods can the German Space Agency choose from for different budget thresholds?,"According to $55 of the Federal Budget Act, con- tracts assigned by the German Space Agency have to be tendered. The Agency has to consider the budget law as well as the competition regulations in order to de- fine the right way to award the contract. Accordingly, the Agency may opt for a public tender, a restricted tender or a single tender action (in case of delivery of a product or service below the threshold level of €130 000, or €200 000 in the case of a service involving research and development) or for an open, closed or negotiated procedure (above the named thresholds). ",True,2
What must the Agency provide to enable applicants to prepare their offers effectively?,"The Agency prepares a detailed specification of the services to be rendered, irrespective of which of the above-mentioned procedures is followed. This is necessary so that the applicant/tenderer can prepare an offer. Anyone interested in applying for tender studies the newspapers, official journals, professio- nal journals as well as the supplement to the official journal of the EU because the Agency is obligated to publish its tenders in these organs. ",True,1
What is the consequence for a tenderer who fails to submit their offer by the specified deadline?,"Sometimes, the Agency may simply contact certain entities and ask them to prepare an offer of services meeting the specification. But this may only be done if a tender was launched beforehand in order to prepare the list of participants from which the Agency then chooses the entities to be contacted. The tenderer has to meet the deadline for submission of the offer, as the tenderer will otherwise be excluded from further consideration. ",True,2
What process is followed to determine the most economical offer among received bids?,"The offers received in time are checked on formal issues, after which a tender commission selects the most economical offer. Whether or not an offer is the most economical is decided using criteria established beforehand. A weighting coefficient is determined for each criterion. It is not the lowest price alone which determines the outcome.. ",True,1
What percentage of a contract must involve research and development for it to be categorized as such?,The tenderer who bids the most economical offer is accepted to negotiate a contract on the basis of this offer. The contract is usually a research and develop- ment contract. This is the case if at least 25% of the contract is on research and development issues.,True,2
How does the type of contractor affect the payment structure in contracts?,"The contract includes a detailed description of the project, the period in which the contract is to be executed as well as an agreement about payments.

What remuneration method is applied if a contractor does not use a cost calculation?,"uses a cost calculation, the project is remunerated on a cost basis. This applies to industry, but also to the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft and the Helmholtz Associa- tion. If the contractor does not use a cost calculation, the project is remunerated on an expenditure basis (all expenditures have to be proved by receipts). This ap- plies to the Max Planck Society, universities and most research organizations. ",True,3
What does the contractor bear the risk of in a refund basis agreement?,"For remuneration on a cost basis, the (offered) market price is to be agreed. Only in the case of a single tender action or a negotiation procedure applied to the tender can remuneration (on a cost basis) be by primary costs on a fixed price basis, or by primary costs on a refund basis. The contractor bears the risk of additional cost if market price or primary costs on a refund basis was agreed. In the case of primary costs on a fixed price basis, the contractor only bears the risk of additional necessary efforts. ",True,2
What type of price agreement is necessary for expenditure-based remuneration?,"For remuneration on an expenditure basis, the parties have to agree on a fixed price instead of a market price, or a price based on primary costs on a fixed price basis, or on an expenditure refund instead of a price based on primary cost on a refund basis. The contractor must comply with ECSS standards in general. While these standards apply to industries only by voluntary commitment or contractual refe- rence, the Agency is bound to these standards for all projects which are undertaken in the framework of the national space program. ",True,2
What are the general terms linked to research and technology contracts specified by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research?,"Hence, the Agency has to pass on these obligations to all its contractors. Finally, the contract includes stipulations on the termination of the contract, withdrawal and other general matters. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research has specified general terms and conditions for research and technology contracts of the type of primary costs on a refund basis (BEBF 98). These terms and conditions are also used by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology for contracts concluded in the context of the German space program. ",True,2
What type of contracts apply the general terms and conditions by analogy?,"These general terms and conditions apply by way of analogy also to contracts of the type of costs on a refund basis; for contracts based on (primary) fixed costs they apply to a limited extent. BEBF 98 deals with issues which are generally applicable to research and development contracts, in addition to the text of a particular con- tract. They are included in the contract by reference.

What are the required conditions for a contractor to subcontract contract obligations?,"the contract is to be executed. The chargeable costs are listed, as are the terms of invoicing and the pay- ment itself. The terms allow for price checks by the principal. In case the contractor wants to subcontract obligations of the contract to another entity, BEBF 98 provides some rules on how the contractor can do so. The contractor has obligations to report to the principal. Furthermore, it is stipulated that all results of the research and development performance of the contractor (i.e., findings, know-how, inventions, pro- ducts) be owned by the principal. ",True,2
What obligation does the contractor have regarding inventions made by employees during contract execution?,"But the contractor may establish an exploitation plan including a stipu- lation that the contractor may be entitled to exploit the result in order to receive royalties. If the employees of the contractor invent something in the course of exercising the contract, the contractor as employer has to claim the invention and to file a patent (before publishing the result/invention). BEBF 98 obliges the contractor to publish the results, but not before having filed a patent or protected any other (intellectual) property right. ",True,3
What is the duration of the contractor's guarantee for the quality of the work performed?,"Finally, the principal accepts the result and produces a final report in coordination with the contractor.

What type of agreement is chosen when both Germany and a contractor have a need for research results?,"Particular Case: Cooperation Agreement with the German Aerospace Center While the German Space Agency within the German Aerospace Center can only enter into a research and development contract, as described above, if there is a clear governmental need for the results, there might be cases where there is a need of the result for both Germany and the contractor. Here the parties choose a public-private partnership agreement [9.4.51]. ",True,2
What is the primary purpose of public-private partnership contracts in the discussed space program?,"Such agreements are explicitly mentioned in the German space program as a specific and desired means to achieve the aims of the program. Public—private part- nership agreements were used by the Agency in the past mainly to execute the remote sensing program. A public-private partnership contract reflects the special interest of both parties in the result.

How is ownership of results determined in public-private partnerships compared to research and development contracts?,"as possible. Again, the more technical details are an- nexed to the contract. This includes definition of the risks which each of the parties bear in case of non- achievement of the results. While the ownership of the results (especially patents) is with the principal in a research and development contract, the regulations in a public-private partnership are different. Here there is no clear distinction made between principal and contractor; that is, which party has to develop a result against payments by the other party. ",True,2
What essential elements must parties agree on to establish ownership of project results?,"This is why the parties explicitly have to agree on who should be the owner of which result, on how to proceed with filing any results if this is possible, and who has an additio- nal right to use (exclusively or non-exclusively) these results. A public-private partnership agreement also has to include stipulations on how payments between the parties are made. As there might be damage to the parties while the contract is executed, they should agree on liability clauses. ",True,3
What type of conduct limits the application of cross-waiver in German outer space contracts?,"It is common understanding in many research and development contracts on outer space projects that the parties agree on a cross-waiver of liability. This means that none of the parties is allowed to claim damages from the other party. In Germany, such a cross-waiver has to be limited to da- mages which are caused by negligence or carelessness. For damages caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence, the other party does not have to refrain from claiming damages. ",True,3
What is the primary aim of the cross-waiver in financial agreements?,"The cross-waiver is intended to limit the (financial) risks of both parties. Finally, the public-private partnership agreement contains general stipulations on nondisclosure, publication, termination and arbitration or litigation.. ",True,1

What contractual arrangement may require a manufacturer to launch and position a satellite into orbit?,"The parties to a launch service agreement are usually the launch service provider and the operator of the object to be launched. But the operator can also negotiate the above-mentioned contract for manufacturing the satellite in such a way that the manufacturer’s obligation is not only to build and provide the satellite, but also to launch and place the satellite in orbit (a delivery in orbit or turnkey contract). Then, it is not until the positioning took place that the manufacturer has met all its obligations. ",True,2
Who is responsible for entering into an agreement with the launch service provider?,2/25/09 3:37:33 PM 9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activitiestoward the principal (operator). It is the manufacturer who has to enter into a launch service agreement with the launch service provider.,True,2
What is the primary purpose of a launch service agreement according to the given information?,"The main content of a launch service agreement [9.4.52] is to attribute the risk of a launch failure or wrong positioning to one of the parties of the agree- ment. This is done by several stipulations within the agreement, which have to be read together.",True,2
What is the financial obligation of the operator per kilogram to the launch service provider?,"The main contractual obligations are the fol- lowing: While the operator is obliged to pay a certain amount to the launch service provider (depending on the rocket used, currently roughly $10 000-20 000 per kilogram), the launch service provider is obliged to launch the object. The agreement has to specifically define what a “launch” is: that is, when the launch service provider has fulfilled its obligations under the agreement. ",True,2
Who bears the risk of failure prior to the launch of a rocket?,"This is important, as at this point it is not the launch service provider but the operator who bears any risk of failure or wrong positioning. The parties are free to stipulate that the launch took place when the rocket was ignited and took off. But they may also stipulate that the launch took place when the designa- ted orbit was reached, the commissioning phase was finalized, or the satellite started operation.. ",True,2
How does a launch service agreement mitigate the risk of failure for the service provider?,"The risk of failure is with the launch service pro- vider to achieve what has been agreed. But the launch service agreement differs from many other contracts insofar as this risk is limited in two ways. First, a launch service agreement typically includes a best effort clause. This specifies that the launch service provider is not obliged to guarantee the result (i.e., positio- ning, or whatever has been agreed) but only obliged to make a best effort to achieve this result. ",True,3
What is the typical obligation of a launch service provider if no specific guarantee clause is included in the agreement?,"Only if a standard type of satellite bus is launched repeatedly with the same rocket type might there be a reason to agree with the launch service provider that the result is guaranteed. If the agreement does not include the one or the other clause, the launch service provider is usually only obliged to provide a best effort, based on the applicable laws. Second, the agreement typically includes a restriction, according to which the parties agree on a cross-waiver of liability. ",True,2
What type of risk is assumed by the launch service provider in a launch agreement?,"The launch service provider only bears the risk of damages which occur on its side (especially damage to the rocket), while the operator bears the risk of the damages occurred on its side (especially damage to the object which was going to be launched). Such a cross-waiver is usually. ",True,2
Under what circumstances can a cross-waiver become invalid?,independent of any stipulation made on the basic risk attribution. But a cross-waiver might be void if one of the parties caused the damage through gross negligence or willful misconduct.,True,2
Who bears the risk for damage to the operator during a satellite launch?,"As a result, the launch service provider typically bears the risk that it does not provide the best effort to achieve the agreed result; in case damage occurs, although the launch service provider has provided the best effort, it bears the risk for damage occurring to itself as well as to any third party. But the launch service provider does not bear the risk for damage caused to the operator, especially not damage to the satellite which was going to be launched.. ",True,2
Who bears more risk in a launch contract compared to other transport contracts?,"Compared to any other type of contract on trans- port, the risks shared between the parties are shifted toward the operator of the object to be launched. This is because of the likelihood of damages which might occur in the launch phase, but also to the uniqueness of each agreement, since almost every rocket has to be adapted for the specific satellite bus type used. But the operator has other means within the agreement to shift some risk back to the launch service provider. ",True,2
What are the responsibilities of the operator in connection with satellite rebuilding and launch costs?,"The latter can agree with the operator for an unpaid re-launch. Hence, the operator only bears the costs for rebuilding the satellite, but does not need to buy a launch rocket for the second attempt. The operator also should try to obligate the launch service provider to accept reviews and procedures for accepting and approving intermediate services performed by the launch service provider as well as to admit employees of the operator to the site of the launch service provi- der while the launch is being prepared..

What option exists for both parties to manage their remaining risks?,The remaining risks for both parties may be (part- ly) shifted to an insurer.,True,2
What components are specified in a launch service agreement regarding risk sharing and launch schedule?,"In addition to these stipulations on risk sharing, a launch service agreement contains several other elements: the parties agree on definitions of essential terms used in the agreement, in order to achieve a common understanding (e.g., failure, partial loss, total loss); the launch schedule as well as the launch window will be agreed upon, as well as milestones for payment (e.g., based on the progress of launch preparations) and rules for postponement of the launch.

What aspects regarding ownership and integration of launched objects are clarified in a launch service agreement?,in orbit for some time). It is suggested that a stipu- lation on how to inform all launching states is also included. A launch service agreement often includes the clarification that ownership of the object which is going to be launched is not affected by its integration in the rocket. Questions of intellectual property rights as well as the transfer of know-how might also be of importance to the parties. ,True,2
What provision allows for the ending of a contract if a rocket type fails in a preceding launch?,"The parties might agree on non-disclosure of information and termination of the contract (e.g., the right of the operator to terminate the contract if the rocket type which is intended to be used for the launch fails in another launch which takes place right before the launch which is the subject of the agreement).. ",True,2
What are the legal considerations that arise from the functionality of satellites and probes during their missions?,"Operation of a Space ObjectDepending on the specific space mission, the ope- ration of a satellite, probe, etc., gives rise to many legal issues. Three of them are mentioned here as examples.",True,2
What can an operator do if unable to transmit telemetry and control signals?,"If the operator is not able or does not want to transmit the signals for telemetry, tracking and control, the operator can contract this service to the operator of a ground station. Even if this is not intended for the whole mission, it is usually done for positioning a satellite. This is because the coverage of the central ground station might not be sufficient for contacting the satellite as often as necessary to conduct all foreseen maneuvers and tests. ",True,2
What must a contract with a ground segment operator include regarding signal handling?,"Also, a ground seg- ment can be contracted in order to download satellite data because the cache capacity available on-board the satellite is restricted. This is the case for many remote sensing activities. A contract with a ground segment operator must specify the obligations of both parties (transmission of signals or reception of data), the handling of signals (authentication) and data (encryp- tion). ",True,3
What contingency provisions should be established if ground segments fail to signal satellites?,"The parties should also agree on backups in case the ground segments contracted are not able to send signals to the satellite. Finally, the parties should agree on who is responsible for applying for the allocation of necessary frequencies.. ",True,2
What are the potential consequences of insufficiently describing products or services in contracts?,"The operator might need to conclude sales con- tracts for products and services (e.g., remote sensing data, navigation signals, telecommunication services). Again, the product or service to be delivered should be described as precisely as possible, because the clients may raise liability claims for breach of warranty. For9 Management of Space Projects",True,3
What should parties focus on regarding damages in navigation service failures?,"some services the service provider may be able to negotiate a disclaimer of warranty; for example, for the case that there is an interruption in supplying na- vigation signals which are transmitted for no or little remuneration. Especially in the domain of navigation services, the parties need to focus on consequential damages caused by the malfunction of the signals. If the service provided also includes the development of products, such as remote sensing data products, the parties have to conclude user (license) agreements for them.. ",True,3
What contractual agreements can a satellite operator enter for unused satellite bus space?,"Ifa satellite operator is not in need of all the space on a satellite bus, the operator may agree with other service providers to integrate third-party payloads on the satellite bus. This might be the case if a tele- communications operator only requires some of the transponders on a satellite for the operator’s own use and makes the others available to another provider. This may constitute a funding source for the satellite operator (see below), which means that the operator will enter into a rental or leasing contract. ",True,3
What conditions must be outlined for the lessee to manage leased transponders separately?,"The con- tract should especially stipulate the conditions under which the lessee or tenant may control the leased transponders irrespective of and independent from the other transponders or under which conditions the lessee or tenant may change telemetry, tracking and command signals in order to adapt the operation of the whole space segment to the needs of the lessee or tenant’s own services. The transponders leased to another party need to be described and located as precisely as possible in order to differentiate them from the transponders owned by the operator or any other person. ",True,2
What must be determined regarding ownership in case of a transponder malfunction during a mission?,"If a transponder fails in the course of the mission, it has to be clear who is the owner or lessee of that specific transponder, and the lessor and the lessee have to accordingly agree on who bears the risk of failure and to which extent this risk is borne.. ",True,1
What are the options for individuals to manage risks associated with space missions?,"Insurance for Space Activities The insurance market is now able to provide a number of different kinds of insurance for space activities. Any person involved in a space mission has to consider whether they want to bear the technical and commercial risks remaining with them according to the contracts concluded, or whether they want to cover these risks by taking out an insurance policy or by using their savings (which would be self-insurance).

What type of insurance is often required by national legislation for space activity participants?,2/25/09 3:37:34 PM 9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activitiesmight be an area where it is compulsory to take out an insurance policy: some national legislation requires persons to have third-party liability insurance.,True,3
What is required for a German satellite launched from countries with compulsory insurance legislation?,"In Germany, there is for the time being no such compulsory third-party liability insurance. But any German operator has to realize that also foreign legislation requiring such a compulsory insurance might have an effect. If for example a German satel- lite is launched from the USA, Russia or Australia, the launch (including the payload satellite) has to be compulsorily insured against third-party liability claims. ",True,2
What is the insurance coverage requirement for third-party liability in the USA for satellite operations?,"For Ariane launches, compulsory third-party insurance is required quasi by law. If a German satel- lite is operated by a US, Russian or UK national, the operation also has to be insured against third-party liability claims. In the USA, such insurance has to have a maximum coverage equivalent to about €415 million (or the maximum probable loss), in Australia the equivalent of roughly €450 million (but at least the maximum probable loss), in Russia the equivalent of between €80 and €250 million, and in the United Kingdom the equivalent of roughly €145 million.

What types of damages are covered by insurance during a space mission?,"Other insurance may be taken out on a voluntary basis. Today, almost all aspects of a space mission are insurable: damage caused to someone’s own property, damage to contractors and damage to third parties. There is insurance coverage for damage occurring in the course of manufacturing a satellite, its transport to the launch facility, its integration into the rocket, its launch, its positioning as well as its operation in outer space. ",True,2
What are the potential insurance coverages for inoperable satellites or their reentry into the atmosphere?,"To some extent, also the retention of an inoperable satellite in outer space (as debris) as well as the reentry of a satellite into the Earth’s atmosphere might be insured. The insurance might cover technical failures, delays in operation, or loss of income.. ",True,2
What percentage of service unavailability qualifies as a total loss for insurance purposes?,"The parties have to define in the insurance po- licy the insured event. This includes agreement on when the parties assume damage to a satellite to be an interruption of business, a partial loss, or a total loss (which can already be the case if 51% of the ser- vice is unavailable). Some risks (e.g., force majeure) might be excluded by the parties. The parties have to determine the amount of coverage, that is the sum. ",True,2
What factors influence the determination of insurance rates in unstable markets?,"insured and paid by the insurer in case the insured event takes place. Based on the amount of coverage, the parties agree upon the insurance rates which are to be paid. As the insurance market at the moment is very unstable and volatile, specific figures are very much dependent on the moment when the insurance contract is concluded as well as on the peculiarities of the contracted space mission. Finally, the parties define the duration of coverage. For the operation of a satellite the usual duration is currently 12 months, subject to renewal.. ",True,3
Who bears the responsibility for damage or malfunctions regarding a satellite ordered from a manufacturer?,"Any person intending to conclude insurance must thoroughly assess the risks remaining with that person. If, for example, the operator of a satellite has ordered a satellite from a manufacturer, that manufacturer is responsible for delivering the satellite as specified in the contract. Damage or malfunctions in this area are the risk of the manufacturer. If, for example, the ope- rator has concluded a launch service agreement, the launch service provider has to take the risk of a launch failure. ",True,2
What should the operator do if the launch service agreement specifies liability limits during positioning?,"But this risk is, as seen above, limited in certain ways. If the launch service agreement stipulates that the launch has taken place when the rocket has lifted off, and the failure happens while the satellite is being positioned, the operator should have insured this. If the launch service agreement contains a cross-waiver of liability, the operator should insure for damage to the satellite also occurring in the launch phase.. ",True,3
What factors influence the development of an effective insurance agreement?,"The negotiation of an adequate and balanced insurance policy is very much dependent on the par- ticularities of every single case [9.4.53], [9.4.54].",True,3
What considerations arise when transmitting satellite technical details for insurance to a foreign insurer?,"Many (technical) details of the satellite, its pay- loads and the rocket have to be transmitted to the insurer for calculating the amount to be covered as well as the insurance rate. If the insurer is based in a foreign state, the transmittal of such information might be technology listed as a dual-use item, which can be subject to export control regulation.",True,3
What is necessary before generating income from space activities?,"Financing Space ActivitiesBefore the first income can be generated (e.g., by providing telecommunication services or by selling remote sensing satellite data), the operator must invest a lot of resources.

What type of contract allows a manufacturer to retain ownership of a satellite until full payment is made by the operator?,"Often, at the beginning of such a space mission, the provider does not have many funds at its disposal. Therefore, the provider will enter into contracts with people who can provide credit capital. This can be done with a conditional sales contract concluded with the manufacturer: the payment of the manu- facturer will be settled by installments, the satellite will be delivered to the operator upon completi- on, but ownership of the satellite remains with the manufacturer until the last installment is paid by the operator. ",True,3
What role does the bank play in a leasing contract for satellite financing?,"A credit agreement can also be in the form of a leasing contract with a bank. Instead of the operator, the bank purchases the satellite from the manufacturer. Hence, the bank is owner of the satellite. The bank will provide the right of use to the operator, and the operator has to pay leasing installments in return. Finally, a general credit agree- ment can be concluded. A credit agreement obliges the bank to provide a certain amount of payment to the operator, while the operator transfers several security rights to the bank (project financing). ",True,2
What rights can the operator pledge to the bank in relation to its assets?,"This includes an agreement according to which the bank becomes the owner of some assets (e.g., the satellite) and transfers to the operator the right to use these assets (transfer by way of security). In addition the operator may pledge stakes in its corporation or entitlements of contracts to the bank, such as the right to use TT&C, the right to replace the operator in the launch service agreement, insurance rights or license agreements [9.4.55].. ",True,3
What can a bank do if an operator fails to repay a loan under a general credit agreement?,"If the operator cannot repay the credit to the bank, the bank can make use of the security interest granted to it: if the bank has agreed on a general credit agree- ment the bank can liquidate the rights resulting out of the contracts or stakes pledged to it. If ownership in the satellite was transferred to the bank, the bank may terminate the right of the operator to use the satellite. It may then sell the satellite to a third party. ",True,2
What actions can a manufacturer take after terminating a conditional sale or leasing agreement?,"If the manufacturer has agreed upon a conditional sale or leasing agreement, it can terminate this agreement. It may then transfer the right to use the satellite to a third party or even sell the satellite.. ",True,2
What legal limitations exist for the remedies that can be exercised concerning the satellite's ownership?,"Both the bank and the manufacturer, who are own- ers of a satellite by way of the transfer of security in- terests, have to consider that the exercise of remedies (e.g., to sell the satellite) can proceed only according to law. The parties cannot deviate by contract. The9 Management of Space Projects",True,3
What factors must be considered when assessing credit amounts related to mobile equipment installments?,"bank faces difficulties especially with regard to mo- bile equipment, such as satellites: the remedies may only be exercised by the laws of the state, where the equipment is located at the moment of default (i.e., the operator is no longer able to pay the credit install- ments). The bank and the manufacturer will have to take this uncertainty into account when defining the amount of credit paid in respect to the amount of the installments. ",True,3
What are the key locations involved in the lifecycle of satellite equipment regarding its movement?,"Therefore the parties should know into which states the equipment might be brought. For satellites, the places of manufacturer, transport and launch are important.. ",True,2
What challenges exist in determining applicable law for remedies involving satellites in outer space?,"From a legal point of view, there will be difficul- ties in defining the law applicable to the exercise of remedies when the satellite has been launched and placed in outer space. According to the above, the laws of the state where the equipment is located applies. But as also noted above, outer space is international territory (Art. II of the Outer Space Treaty), which also excludes the application of national laws. ",True,2
What aspects do some scholars believe are covered by the laws of the state of satellite registration?,"Some scholars argue that for the exercise of remedies the laws of the state apply in which the satellite has been registered. This is because this state of registry retains jurisdiction over and control of the object according to Art. VIII of the Outer Space Treaty. This “jurisdiction and control” includes application of the national laws, so they argue. According to other scholars, the laws of the state where the main ground segment (control station) is located apply [9.4.56].. ",True,3
What is the purpose of the UNIDROIT Convention regarding mobile equipment?,"This legal uncertainty may be overcome in the medium term. The UNIDROIT Convention on secu- rity interests in high-value mobile equipment (Cape Town Convention) provides for a harmonization of the national laws on security interests. States ratifying this Convention are called to amend their national laws according to the rules of the Convention. The more states have done so, the less uncertainty re- mains for banks concerning how to exercise remedies in foreign states. ",True,2
What types of transport does the Cape Town Convention currently govern?,"The Cape Town Convention today only applies to aircraft, engines and helicopters. It will soon be applicable to railways and railway wa- gons. And it might become applicable to satellites and other space objects through ratification of a protocol on space assets [9.4.57].

What additional liability risks should be considered for space missions compared to ordinary activities?,"A space mission is subject to ordinary liability risks, just as any other activity. But there are additional liability risks which have to be taken into account.",True,3
What can a contracting partner claim if obligations are not met or are met incorrectly?,"First, the activity is subject to the typical liabilities resulting from the laws as well as from all concluded contracts. If a contracting party does not meet its contractual obligations the contracting partner may claim compensation for damage. The same applies if a contracting partner does meet its obligations, but incompletely or incorrectly or only after a delay. If a third party is damaged in the course of the missi- on, this third party may claim for compensation of damages according to the law (tort law). ",True,2
What is the obligation of the party responsible for causing damage regarding the restoration of the situation?,"The party damaged is entitled to compensation for every finan- cial loss which occurred, irrespective of whether the claim is based on a contract or on the laws. The party who caused the damage has to reestablish the situation as it was before the damaging event took place. This compensation may be done by repairing the damage. But usually compensation takes place by payment of a certain sum of money.. ",True,3
What is commonly excluded in research and development agreements regarding liabilities for damages?,Some contractual liabilities may be excluded by the parties. A cross-waiver of liabilities for damages which were not caused through gross negligence or willful misconduct is very typical in the context of research and development contracts.,True,2
What type of liability applies when damage occurs without the fault of a party involved in a contract?,"Basically, a contractual liability can only be clai- med if the damage is based on the fault of one con- tracting party. Fault is given if the damage was caused willfully or by negligence. The legislation may, howe- ver, specify that for certain activities liability is also given without fault. This is called strict (absolute) liability. The reason for such a legislative decision may be that an activity is deemed to be basically dangerous. ",True,2
What type of liability allows a claimant to recover damages without proving fault against the responsible party?,"A strict liability implies a higher liability risk: a person damaged does not need to prove that the person responsible for the damage has caused the damage by fault. A strict liability exists, for example in air traffic law for the operation of an aircraft ($3 of the German Air Traffic Act), but not for space activities.. ",True,3
What legal responsibility does a nation hold for space objects causing damage on Earth or to airborne vehicles?,"However, some other states have implemented in their national legislation a strict liability for the launching and reentry of space objects. The reasoning is that a similar concept applies in international law, since the launching state is absolutely liable for damage caused by space objects on the Earth or to aircraft in flight, see Art. II of the Liability Convention.",True,4
How should liability claims be managed if the parties involved cannot agree on applicable law during an international space mission?,"Many space activities are conducted under inter- national cooperation. This may raise the question of which national law is applicable to liability issues. Every contract should therefore include a clause agreeing on the applicable law. If the parties have not agreed on this, the law of the place where the con- tractual obligation was accomplished is applicable. If a third party is damaged in the course of a space mission and the context is international, the parties cannot agree on the applicable law. The claims are handled according to the laws of the state in which the damage occurred.. ",True,3
What options are available for a person seeking compensation for damages caused by a third party?,"For damages caused to third parties some specifics have to be taken into account. A person damaged may directly claim for compensation from the person who caused the damage. In addition, a liability of the launching state exists according to the international treaties (Art. VII of the Outer Space Treaty, Arts. I-IV of the Liability Convention). The person damaged may choose whether to claim against the person who caused the damage or against a launching state. ",True,2
What is the relationship between a state's liability and the cause of damage in space launches?,"The liability of the launching state is not linked to the factor which caused the damage, but only to the par- ticipation of that state in the event of the launch. This international liability also exists when the damage is caused years later in the course of operation or reentry of the object into the Earth’s atmosphere. And this international liability also exists if the damage was caused by the operator. ",True,2
What is a requirement for a launching state to seek recourse against an operator for damages?,"If the person damaged chooses to claim against a launching state, this state might be interested in taking recourse against the operator or any other person who caused the damage. This can be done only if there is a legal basis in the national laws. This is the case in some states (e.g., Russian Federa- tion, USA, United Kingdom and Australia). Most of these states have at the same time limited this recourse to a certain amount of money, typically the amount of the compulsory third-party liability insurance of the operator. This leads to insurability of the activity and also provides some financial protection for the. ",True,3
What is lacking in Germany regarding legal recourse in the national industry?,2/25/09 3:37:35 PM CHO9.indd Sec1:832national industry. In Germany there is actually no legal basis for such recourse.,True,1
What potential benefit does the liability of launching states provide to space object operators in third-party damage cases?,"For any person launching or operating a space object, the additional international liability of the launching states has a positive effect. It can be of ad- vantage for the operator who caused damage toa third party if this third party does not claim compensation against the operator but against a launching state. This launching state may indeed take recourse against the operator. But this recourse is often limited. ",True,3
What is the operator's obligation if a direct claim is made by a third party?,"Then the operator and the launching state(s) share the liability. Otherwise, in case there is a direct claim of the third party against the operator, the operator has to fully compensate the third party.. ",True,2
What are the main strategies discussed for dealing with objects in space that no longer serve a purpose?,Another specific aspect of liability issues in outer space is the treatment of space debris. Space debris consists of human-made objects which are in outer space but which have lost their function of using or exploring outer space. Debris may also include former parts of a space object. The avoidance and mitigation of space debris is an important and current topic in many fora. Many approaches are taken. ,True,2
What organization has created widely utilized technical standards regarding space debris management?,The most famous might be the approach of the Inter-Agen- cy Space Debris Coordination Committee. It has developed rules which are widely used as technical standards.. ,True,3
What defines the liability of a launching state for space debris after termination of operation?,"If damage occurs despite all efforts to avoid or mitigate debris, the question arises whether or not the (former) operator is liable for such damage. Liability does not end with the termination of operation. Space debris is also regarded as an object which was once launched for the purpose of using or exploring outer space. The launching states are liable regardless of the functional status of the object. ",True,3
What determines liability for damage caused by space debris according to the relevant convention?,"Their liability is given because of their involvement at the very moment of the launch. If space debris later causes damage and if this damage even was caused after reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere or to aircraft in flight, the launching state is absolutely liable (see Art. II of the Liability Convention). Otherwise it is fault liability (Arts. III, IV of the Liability Convention), but fault is already given if technical standards for avoidance or mitigation of debris were not followed, either willfully or by negligence.. ",True,3
What liability does an operator face regarding damages caused by debris?,"To the same extent the (former) operator is also liable for damages caused by space debris. If the (for- mer) operator has willfully or by negligence omitted9 Management of Space Projectsto consider measures to avoid damage (e.g., to put the object into a graveyard orbit or to bring the object to a controlled re-entry), this may cause liability.",True,2
What condition must an operator meet regarding fuel for orbital maneuvers when using frequency and orbital position rights?,Any operator who has the right to use frequency and orbital position because of a transfer of such rights by the Federal Network Agency are subject to a condition that sufficient fuel has to be retained in order to allow orbital maneuvers to terminate ope- ration. Satellites in a geostationary orbit should be brought into a graveyard orbit or caused to reenter the Earth’s atmosphere according to 3.7 of Administrative Order 8/2005.. ,True,3
What key organizations are involved in the governance and execution of space initiatives in Europe?,9.4.3 Space Activities in the Framework of the EU and ESA,True,3
What influences the strategies of private entrepreneurs in space activities?,"European activities in outer space have never been exclusively national, bilateral or trilateral activities. There has always been a European dimension. This European dimension is also of relevance for every pri- vate entrepreneur, university or research institution. Every decision taken in the framework of the ESA as well as in the framework of the EU has implications for their activities. Especially those decisions which are of a political and programmatic character and which define their mid-term perspectives can influence the strategy of such non-governmental entities. ",True,2
What types of organizations may receive financial contracts from the EU or ESA according to governmental decisions?,"It might be interesting for them to orientate according to these governmental perspectives, as there might be financial support forthcoming in the form of grants. Since these decisions define areas in which the EU or ESA might assign contracts to national industry, university or re- search organizations in the future, it is recommended that these decision-making processes on political and programmatic issues at the European level be closely followed to the same extent that the same processes at the national level are followed.. ",True,1
What are the distinguishing factors that differentiate the EU and ESA as actors in outer space?,"Both the EU and ESA have meanwhile become actors in outer space. But both have to be strictly differentiated, also because of their different histories. They will therefore be described separately.",True,2
What body within ESA convenes every two to four years to establish space policy principles?,The main decisions within ESA are made by the Council at ministerial level. This Council is convened every two to four years. It is within this Council that the ESA member states agree on the basic political principles of the organization’s space policy. At the,True,2

What principle dictates the reallocation of funds from ESA to national industries based on member state contributions?,"same time the member states designate the amount of their participation within the (optional) program lines of ESA; that is, how much money states will transfer to ESA for executing the programs. As ESA is based on the principle of geo-return, by deciding on the amount of money to be transferred to ESA, the member states decide at the same time about the per- centage of money which is going to be retransferred to their national industry (universities and research organizations). ",True,2
What principle requires a member state to conclude contracts with its entities proportional to its financial contributions to a program?,"This principle basically says that if a member state pays a certain percentage of money for a defined program, the same percentage value of contracts has to be concluded with entities of that same state for executing this program.. ",True,2
Which entities are responsible for making key decisions within the European Union?,The main decisions within the EU are made by the Council and the Parliament or within the European Commission. Outer space activities will be explicitly mentioned for the first time in the basic treaties of the EU when the EC Treaty as amended by the Lisbon Treaty enters into force. Therein the competence for carrying out space activities (especially the definition and implementation of programs) will be shared among the EU and the member states. ,True,1
What is the proposed measure for the EU regarding space exploration without harmonizing member state laws?,"The EU is called on to draw up a European space policy and to establish the necessary measures, which may take the form of a European space program, excluding any harmonization of the laws and regulations of the member states.. ",True,2
What document outlines the fundamental principles on space by the European Commission?,"On another level, the European Commission (which is, broadly speaking, the Executive) has de- cided on some basic principles on space published in its White Paper entitled “Space: a new European frontier for an expanding Union. An action plan for implementing the European space policy.” The White Paper implements European space policy (which is a policy at the EU level and should not be confused with the European Space Policy which recently was agreed between the EU and ESA, see below). ",True,1
What are the key roles of GMES and Galileo in relation to international treaties?,"Global Moni- toring for Environment and Security (GMES) as well as Galileo have a central role within the White Paper, accompanied by issues on digital divide, outer space for common security and defense policies, monito- ring conflict areas from outer space and monitoring compliance with international treaties and agreement (e.g., treaties on disarmament). Cooperation between the EU and ESA as well as with the Russian Federation is explicitly mentioned within the aims of the policy.. ",True,3
What are the key components for Europe to attain strategic independence in space activities?,"Besides naming these aims, the White Paper also de- fines key elements for achieving them: Europe has to achieve strategic independence from other spacefaring nations, especially with regard to parts and compli- ances for space objects as well as with regard to access to space; the focus is to be on technologies which are of special importance for future developments, and the exploration of outer space and scientific education are considered to be essential elements. ",True,3
What is the starting year of the 7th Framework Program initiated by the European Commission?,"Also on the level of the European Commission, the 7th Framework Program should be mentioned here. This program started in 2007 and defines the areas in which the European Commission commissions (outer space) research activities to European industries, universi- ties and research organizations. Tendering for these contracts is in full and open competition.. ",True,1
What formal agreements were established to enhance collaboration between the ESA and the EU?,"Cooperation between the EU and ESA has grown in recent years, despite their different histories and tasks, almost conflicting industrial policies and some differences in their member states [9.4.58]. This was decided by the Council of ESA as well as by the Council of the EU. Based on these decisions, coope- ration was formalized in common resolutions of the ESA and EU Councils on a common European Space Policy and on a Framework Agreement for further cooperation. ",True,2
What type of cooperation is outlined in the Framework Agreement among parties involved?,"The core stipulation of the Framework Agreement is basically that both continue to execute their tasks based on their own internal procedures, but undertake cooperation in scientific activities, techno- logies development, remote sensing, navigation, tele- communication, human space activities, microgravity research and launching activities. In practical terms, the EU participates in the optional ESA programs of Galileo. ",True,2
What program marks the initial collaboration between both involved parties?,"Galileo is the first huge program in which both bodies cooperate. The second program will be GMES, which is currently being executed by ESA only, but is intended to be transferred to the EU in late 2008. Finally, the Framework Agreement is the basis for the development of a common European Space Policy. In preparation of this policy, a new body was created, the Space Council, which is broadly speaking a union of the Councils of the EU and ESA.. ",True,2
What factors might influence the potential expansion of collaboration between the EU and ESA?,"Whether and to what extent the cooperation between the EU and ESA will be extended to include organizational issues is still written in the stars. Diffe- rent models are being discussed. These discussions are going to be very specific, but in broad terms whether2/25/09 3:37:36 PM 834",True,3
