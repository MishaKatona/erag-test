What is the function of a cylindrical component with corrugated walls used in fluid passageways to allow for movement?,A line (or duct) is an enclosed leak-tight passageway that conveys fluid from one | fluid-system component to another. (The terms “line” and “duct” are used interchangeably | in the aerospace industry and will be so used in this monograph.) A bellows is a thin-wall i circumferentially corrugated cylinder that when integrated into a line can accommodate line movement through deflection of the corrugations (convolutions). A bellows joint normally. 
What device is designed to eliminate impurities from a fluid system by capturing particles within or on a porous surface?,"consists of a bellows and a restraint linkage, but it may be only a free bellows. Flexible hoseconsists of a corrugated (convoluted) innercore restrained by an outer sheath or wire braid. |A filter is a device that removes contaminants from a fluid system by trapping particulatematter within or on the surface of porous material; criticality of most rocket engine"
What process is commonly used to remove impurities from control fluids before they reach fluid-system elements like valves and actuators?,"components requires filtration to some degree for almost all control fluids prior to their entry into valves, actuators, and other fluid-system components."
What are the primary types of considerations that influence the design of line or duct assemblies and their components?,"The successful design of line or duct assemblies and their components is based on manyconsiderations and factors. Some considerations are quite basic and are well grounded intheory, while others are more subtle and have been learned through many failure analyses and experiments."
What are the two primary methods used to achieve flexibility in a line assembly to accommodate deflections?,"| Flexibility is designed into a line assembly so that it can accommodate deflections imposed by various conditions such as thermal expansions and contractions, installation misalignments, operational structural deflections, and thrust-vector gimballing. The most common method for providing flexibility is to incorporate in the line a bellows ora section | of flexible hose or combinations thereof. A second method is to provide a hard line (no hose or bellows) with sufficient flexibility to absorb the imposed deflections, flexibility being achieved by special attention to line configuration, location of elbows, length-to-diameter. "
What are common issues encountered in flexible joint assemblies that can affect overall performance?,"i} ratio, and line material properties. In some instances (e.g., the Titan I engines), rotating ) joints with dynamic seals have been used, but to a much lesser extent than bellows joints or | “flexible” hard lines. The major problems in line assemblies have involved the details of the flexible-joint elements utilized. Less frequent problems have involved the entire assembly and include mechanical | vibration, corrosion, contamination, thermal-cycling fatigue, static-seal leakage, handling damage, and mismade parts. "
"What are the common issues encountered in the design of flexible components, particularly regarding fatigue failures and attachment joint stability?","The major problems with the flexible elements, in addition to | those just listed, have been fatigue failures (from flexure and mechanical or flow-induced vibration), buckling-instability failure, and failure of the duct-to-bellows attachment joint. | The major problems in filter design have been determining the amount of built-in, system-generated, and environmental contaminants to be filtered; contaminant capacity; flow versus pressure drop for filter elements; and the physical size of filter required to satisfy the system requirements. "
What are the key design components addressed in relation to line assembly in the order a designer would logically follow?,"This monograph begins with a discussion of the line assembly that treats the key design elements in the assembly in the logical, chronological order in which a designer would | proceed. Bellows (including linkages, liners, and associated components), flexible hoses, and | filters then are treated in order. Some of the design considerations in these areas overlap. | For example, similar considerations apply to the design of line assemblies with flexible | joints and to the design of a flexible-hose assembly; also, considerations for design of a ! bellows in a flexible joint are similar to those for a bellows in a flexible-hose innercore. "
What are the main components discussed in relation to a rocket engine fluid system?,"| Because the materials-selection factors, handling-protection devices, test requirements, and ; test instrumentation are very similar for lines, bellows, and flexible hoses, this information is | presented only once in the section “LINE ASSEMBLY.” Filters, while not intimately related to ducting, are a critical part of a rocket engine fluid system; they are discussed separately and last in the monograph. "
What are the primary design characteristics of flexible hoses used in operational and advanced-development propulsion systems?,"| | | | | | 2. STATE OF THE ART Lines, bellows, and flexible hoses. — Table I* presents the chief design features of lines bellows, and hoses in typical uses on representative operational and advanced-development engines and vehicles. In the design and application of these components, many problems were solved; some problems still exist and have at best only partial solutions. | Flexible lines are more prevalent on large liquid rocket engines (booster or upper-stage main | propulsion) than on small engines (attitude control or reaction control). "
What type of propellants are primarily used in small engines according to the information provided?,"Small engines seldom have exterior lines except for propellant feedlines. Little flexibility is required in these lines because the engines usually are not gimballed and utilize storable** | (noncryogenic) propellants. The state of the art of rocket engine flexible lines thus is based primarily on experience with large engines. Figure 1 shows the line, bellows, and hose | assemblies on a typical large pump-fed engine (J-2). "
What type of stainless steel family was utilized in the construction of the bellows and feedlines for early launch vehicles?,"| Early launch vehicles, as characterized by the Vanguard and Redstone, had relatively low engine thrust and operating pressures. The flexible-line design problems were solvable within | the state of the art. Free bellows, restrained only by their installation attachment points, | | were used for achieving flexibility in the propellant feed systems. The materials used for | both bellows and feedlines were stainless steels of the 18-percent-chromium, 8-percent-nickel family (18-8 CRES). "
What were the significant materials and design considerations for flexible ducting in propulsion systems for Saturn vehicles?,"Propulsion systems for later launch vehicles (e.g., Jupiter, Thor, Atlas, and Titan) included gimballed engines with greater operating pressures and larger line sizes than those on the Redstone or Vanguard. Flexible lines were more sophisticated and required considerably | more development; 18-8 CRES remained as the predominant type of material, however. The engines of the Saturn vehicles and the associated propellant feed systems presented severe design requirements in flexible ducting. "
What characteristics were crucial for hardware designed for human use to ensure high reliability according to the necessary advancements?,"Advances in the state of the art were necessary to meet those requirements. Line sizes, operating pressures, flow velocities, and gimballing life — all far exceeded anything previously done. Higher strength materials were necessary to minimize structural weights and to provide adequate fatigue life. The hardware, | being man-rated, had to be extremely high in reliability; reliability was proved through | many component, engine, and unmanned-flight tests. "
"What duct assembly type was primarily used in the Saturn vehicle systems, differing from previous designs?","| The Saturn vehicle systems made extensive use of the pressure-volume-compensator (PVC) type of duct assembly. This design concept was not used on any engines or vehicles prior to | the Saturn. Tension-type systems, which include PVC ducts, are the predominant systems | on the Saturn. The free-bellows compression system also was frequently used; examples are “Factors for converting U.S. customary units in the table to the International System of Units (SI units) are given in Appendix A.

What design feature was introduced for hardware specifications with the initiation of the Space Shuttle Program?,"— Typical line, bellows, and hose assemblies on a large pump-fed rocket engine (J-2). | | a eee Se gee Se See Se ee | the LOX suction ducts (non-gimballing) and fuel drain duct on the S-1C and the pump inlet ducts on the J-2 engine. | With the advent of the Space Shuttle Program (ca. 1969), the specifications for hardware | | design included one new feature never before required for space vehicles: reusability. "
What are the requirements for fatigue life and corrosion resistance in a vehicle designed for a high number of missions?,"The | | Space Shuttle must be capable of performing 100 missions. This requirement introduced the need for longer low- and high-cycle fatigue lives, improved long-term corrosion resistance, a | greater number of gimballing cycles for articulating ducts, and ease of maintenance and | refurbishment. For example, some of the flexible vacuum-jacketed lines in the Shuttle Orbiter main propulsion system are made entirely of Inconel 718 for long-term resistance to | | damage and corrosion; in comparison, in the Saturn vehicle lines only the basic bellows were made of this material. "
What maximum pressure was achieved by the pump discharge in the Space Shuttle main engine?,"In addition, the high chamber pressure of the Space Shuttle main engine (3000 psi, three times greater than any previous operational rocket engine), with pump discharge pressures in excess of 7000 psi and pressures in the articulating flex ducts | | greater than 5000 psi, made necessary a giant step in the state of the art for the design and | fabrication of components for service with high-pressure fluid. "
What must be proven through real-time tests to ensure materials are suitable for long-term use in component design?,"Both the long calendar-life requirement (10 years) of the Space Shuttle and the earlier | established long-life requirements for unmanned missions to the outer planets make | consideration of the long-term aspects of materials selection in component design a must. For example, caution must be exercised in using plastic materials beyond a two-year life. ' Real-time tests are required to prove life compatibility of materials; accelerated tests are not | representative. "
What issues arose in critical control components due to contamination introduced during maintenance procedures?,"| Filters. — Recognition of the need for filter protection of critical control components { | occurred with testing of the Redstone engines. Periodic disassembly or disconnecting of control lines and replacement of components permitted contamination to enter the engine | system. Failures of components, generally because of excessive leakage, were traced to the | contamination that had been introduced during the periods of disassembly. "
What factors led to the development of specific specifications for filters in advanced engine programs?,"In subsequent engine programs (Jupiter, Atlas, Thor, Saturn, Space Shuttle), filters were recognized as | being vital components in all systems containing contamination-sensitive control | | components. | Commercial filters were used initially, but as engine requirements became more stringent insofar as envelope and line connections were concerned, specifications to control these | features were generated. "
What are the advantages of wire-mesh filters over stacked etched disks in terms of surface area and flowrate handling?,"Filter specifications subsequently were expanded to control such items as allowable pressure drop, material compatiblity, construction features, filter material, and cleanliness requirements. The majority of filters are made of metallic wire cloth or stacked etched metallic disks; various metals are used, but stainless steel is most common. Most filters have been wire-mesh | types because, in comparison with stacked etched disks, they offer maximum surface area | | for minimum weight and can handle high flowrates. "
What are the primary design characteristics of wire-mesh filters utilized in rocket propulsion systems?,"Metallic-disk types have been restricted | | [ 10 { | | | 1 | | | | i} largely to relatively small engines with low flow requirements. Chief design features of wire-mesh filters used in various rocket engine systems are summarized in table II. The propellants and pressurizing gases supplied to the engine are controlled with respect to moisture and hydrocarbon content, and additional devices such as absorptive separators are not necessary. "
What primary factors must be considered when designing a line configuration for assembly in terms of routing and flexibility?,"| | 2.1 LINE ASSEMBLY | As noted, the line (or duct) assembly may be either a combination of hard lines and flexible elements (bellows joints or flexible hoses) or a completely hard line that achieves flexibility | through the use of bends and material elasticity. Basic design considerations in establishing a | line configuration are routing, sizing, pressure-drop and vibration control, and location and | type of flexible joints; other considerations include materials, cost, weight, reliability, and | maintainability. "
What components are typically found in a flexible-line assembly used for line-system design?,"References 1 through 5 present details on line-system design. | Flexible lines. — A typical flexible-line assembly consists of tubular straight runs and | elbows, with flexible bellows joints located along the line, separable connectors with static ] seals at either end for installation into mating components, and branch-off line connections. | Flexible-line assemblies have been utilized successfully in sizes from '%4-in. "
What are the two primary configurations of flexible lines used in pressurization systems for rocket engines?,"diameter to 27-in. ; diameter, at temperatures from -455°F (liquid helium) for pressurization systems and -423°F (liquid hydrogen) for propellants to + 1300°F (turbine-exhaust gases), with pressures ranging from vacuum to 3000* psi, and with every cryogenic- and storable-propellant combination successfully used in rocket engines. There are two basic flexible-line | configurations: the tension type (fig. "
What type of system uses bellows restrained by linkages to manage axial load generated by internal pressure?,"2), and the compression type (fig. 3). | The tension-type system utilizes bellows restrained by linkages that withstand the pressure separating load (i.e., the axial load due to the force generated by internal pressure that tends to separate the ends of the bellows); the linkages may be either external or internal and permit angular motion. The line routing requires two or more bends with bellows joints | located between bends. "
How do flexible joints accommodate overall length variations in a line assembly?,"Overall length changes in the line assembly are accommodated through angulation of the flexible joints. | | : ] Figure 2 presents two examples of tension-type configurations: the three tension-tie bellows | joints in a dog-leg arrangement, and the axial bellows with two tension-tie bellows joints. In the three-tension-tie configuration (fig. 2(a)), one end of the duct is capable of | three-dimensional movement and angulation in any plane with respect to the other end. "
What type of joints allow for angulation and shear motion in flexible duct systems requiring significant axial deflections?,"The duct is shortened by angulation of the individual flexible joints. In the axial bellows (fig. 2(b)), angulation and shear motion of one end with respect to the other are accommodated by two tension-tie bellows joints. Necessary changes of length are achieved with a thrust-compensating bellows joint. This configuration usually is employed when large axial } deflections are necessary (e.g., in the inlet ducts of a gimballed pump). "

"
What factors must be considered when designing support structures for ducting systems with a high length-to-diameter ratio?,"The pressure separating loads on the bellows are reacted by supporting engine or vehicle structure. In addition, support bracketry may be required to offset column buckling if the ducting has a large length-to-diameter ratio (> 1). If the operating pressures are high and lines are large, the pressure separating forces are correspondingly large, and restraint structure becomes necessarily heavy. Consequently, the compression-type system, although widely used, generally is limited to low-pressure (< 400 psi) applications such as the inlet | ducts of the engine propellant pumps. "
What types of motions can a single free bellows absorb when connecting short-coupled components under low pressure conditions?,"Examples of compression-type configurations shown in figure 3 are the single bellows and the double-bellows spoolpiece. A single free bellows (fig. 3(a)) can be utilized to absorb all | ; motions (angular, shear, or axial) when short-coupled components are to be connected and when the line pressures and motion requirements are relatively low. In this | configuration, the pressure separating load on the bellows is resisted by the end-mounting structure. "
What configuration can be utilized for applications requiring enhanced shear motion while allowing for additional length accommodation?,"The bellows of necessity will be long enough to accommodate all motions | simultaneously. This length could lead to buckling instability, but bellows can be stabilized by external linkages if increased weight and size are not critical considerations. A { double-bellows spoolpiece configuration (fig. 3(b)), which is similar to the single bellows, can be used in applications where greater shear (offset) motion is required and sufficient space { to accommodate the increase in length is available. "
What type of lines are suitable for non-gimballing applications that require flexibility for installation adjustments and thermal changes?,"The turbine exhaust ducts of the engines | on Thor, Atlas, and Saturn vehicles incorporate compression-type bellows. They are | acceptable for use in these systems because the ducts are straight and relatively short and | the operating pressure is low. Hard lines. — Hard lines (lines with no bellows or flexible hose to act as flexible members) may be used in non-gimballing applications where line flexibility is required only to | accommodate installation misalignment and thermal expansion or contraction. "
What factors can a designer manipulate to attain the necessary flexibility in rigid piping systems?,"Because hard lines are quite rigid in comparison with lines with bellows joints, they must be custom-made | to fit the particular installation, or specially sized spacers must be used at the separable connectors to make up installation tolerances. The feature of installation interchangeability ‘ that is inherent in ducts with bellows joints thus is sacrificed with hard lines. Material | selection, wall thickness, and routing are the variables available to the designer for achieving | flexibility necessary to accommodate thermal deflections and deflections resulting from engine operation or in-flight forces. "
"What material was utilized for the high-pressure discharge ducts in a specific rocket engine, and what was its designation?","Figure 4 depicts some common hardline configurations used to achieve flexibility. The successful use of rigid ducts for nongimballing applications in rocket engines has been well established. The pump discharge ducts of the F-1 engine were large-diameter (3-in. for fuel and 6-in. for oxidizer), high-pressure (1600 to 1850 psi) rigid lines made of 6061-T6 | aluminum. The lines had a long history of operation free of failures (45 engines launched, 3179 tests, and 272 500 seconds accumulated engine time). "
What is the diameter of the pump discharge ducts in the J-2S engine?,"| ( 15 | ' | ike a | a fee f gw abheg: CF] Ss ea \ r es “age he é ge) i) nts) Z 1 é 5 © (a) COILED TUBING LINE, ANGULAR (b) COILED TUBING LINE,TORSI!ONAL i y 7 | (c) Z CONFIGURATION (d) _U CONFIGURATION | Figure 4. — Common configurations used to provide flexibility in hard lines. | | The pump discharge ducts of the J-2S engine also were rigid. These ducts were 3 in. in diameter and were made of Armco 21-6-9 alloy. "
"What range of pressure was maintained during the tests, and how many total seconds of firing time were recorded across all engines?","The operating pressure was 1400 to 1600 psi. No failures or misalignment problems occurred in 603 tests, in which 28 444 seconds of firing time on 18 engines were accumulated. Hard lines are used less frequently than are flexible lines in current aerospace vehicle and engine systems. However, this relation could be reversed in future applications if operating pressures increase to the point where the use of bellows joints becomes impractical. "
What factors primarily influence the layout and routing of propulsion-system components in liquid-propellant rocket engine design?,"| : | | 2.1.1 Routing | 2.1.1.1 CENTERLINE GEOMETRY The locations of the propulsion-system components largely determine line routing. In the preliminary design layout of a typical liquid-propellant rocket engine, the primary | | 16 | | | components such as pumps, thrust chamber, and gas generator are located in their optimum | system positions, and the interconnecting ducts are then routed, with a minimum of flexible | joints, within the intervening space; this procedure, however, does not always make for the best ducting arrangement. "
What factors influence the design and routing of ducting in vehicles and spacecraft?,"The ducting often is made up of many turns and elbows, | expansion and contraction sections, and attachment points. The centerline geometry of engine ducting thus represents a compromise in routing between space available and the best ducting design practice. Vehicle and spacecraft ducting also must compromise with practicality. Boost vehicles, for example, to a great extent are cylindrical propellant tanks, and the propellant feed ducting must be limited to long, straight lengths leading from the tank outlets to the engine inlets. "
What factors influence the selection of a flexible-element duct system type in spacecraft design?,"| Spacecraft lines typically are small in diameter, have no flexible joints, and are circuitously routed to fit the limited space available in a structure where size and weight are at a | premium. | 2.1.1.1.1 Flexible Lines | A flexible-element duct system may be a tension, compression, or combination | | tension-compression type. The type of system selected depends on a number of factors (¢.g., the space available, the availability of mounting structure for anchoring, the requirement for | thrust-vector gimballing). "
What factors should be considered when routing and positioning joints in flexible line systems?,"For a line containing flexible joints, centerline geometry is established to minimize the | number of flexible joints. Since a flexible joint (bellows) is complex, costly, and not as reliable as a hard line, the necessity for each flexible joint is carefully scrutinized in the design phase. System considerations that must be kept in mind during the centerline routing and locating of flexible joints include provisions for (1) line deflection and clearance under vibration, thermal contraction and expansion, and engine gimballing, (2) accessibility for installation and removal, (3) wrench clearance around bosses and fittings, (4) accessibility | for in-place welding or brazing, (5) consideration for clearance if foam insulation is required on the line, and (6) accessibility to other major components. "
What principle is followed by the configuration that minimizes the number of joints in engine duct arrangements?,"| A classic configuration adhering to the minimum-number-of-joints principle, believed to | have originated with pump discharge ducts of the Atlas booster engines, is the wraparound duct arrangement for gimballing engines; this configuration, shown in figure 5, locates a flex joint centered on each of the two gimbal axes. This geometry was or is used for the Navaho, | Atlas, Thor, and Jupiter engine pump discharge ducts, the pump inlet ducts of the H-1 | engine, and the gimballing feedlines of the Apollo Service Module engine and the descent | engine for the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM). "
What type of joints are utilized for deflection management in the vehicle-to-engine interface lines of the F-1 engine's gimbal assembly?,"This configuration was used for all of the | vehicle-to-engine interface lines of the F-1 engine on the S-IC except the main propellant } lines. | i | 17 | b INLETS | ‘S) E GIMBAL AXES | - iS By GS) S ~~ Al Flexible joints are located s yy such that only one type of | BS: 27) deflection is applied and | e cd ager use of their deflec- | is ion capability is achieved. IROAT. Joints are titernally tied, | MOUNTED chain-link type and the GIMBAL centers of each are located on the throat-mounted- ( ; gimbal axes. "
What type of joints are used in the ducts of the described propulsion system?,"| ' | Figure 5. — Propellant feedline arrangement on the LEM descent engine. | | | The wraparound concept is used extensively on the SSME, with seven articulating ducts and | six braided metal hose assemblies crossing the engine gimbal plane. Each of the ducts has three tension-type bellows joints with one of the joints centered as closely as possible on each of the gimbal axes. The ducts are arranged in parallel routing around the gimbal in a plane perpendicular to the engine thrust line (fig. "
What analysis is conducted to find the best placement of flexible connections in a duct system?,"6). | The second important consideration in duct routing is the location of flexible joints. Once | the number of flexible joints is established, a kinematic analysis is performed to determine the optimum location for each in the system. Each joint is positioned in the duct assembly to maximize the deflection capability of the assembly. Further, each joint is located and designed to accommodate as few modes of deflection as possible (e.g., axial only, with no shear or angulation) and to minimize any deflection of the joint so that minimum strain is imposed. "
What structural design program was necessary during the early layout phase for the articulated components around the gimbal plane of the engine?,"| The design of the SSME involved many articulating ducts that wrapped around the gimbal plane, and early in the layout phase it became necessary to develop a space-frame program | 18 | | | | | SS Se an ee SS a gl a ee ” — | TYPICAL RIGID TYPICAL PROPELLANT ARTICULATING DUCT COMPONENT INTERCONNECT (LOW-PRESSURE-FUEL-PUMP DISCHARGE DUCT) — (OX101ZER-PREBURNER OXIDIZER DUCT) eo en 2 : PEER 4 | : GG ig BERL /\- | (OMG (2 INENG | LOW-PRESSURE Koy / 1Ge eens CG Wage a | LOX PUMP Sh age? | SS EEO VEIIIIRAS a fee 0; LOW- PRESSURE | eS es BROS Vy S FUEL PUMP | YAW) fs ae SS | Lp = 4 YY | ] — FLEX!

This space-frame program models the duct or line as a series of beam finite elements and accounts for duct flexibility and simulated joint properties. The | appropriate displacements of one end of the duct with respect to the other are applied, and the outputs are joint loads and deflections. "
"What type of joints is preferred in ducting applications due to their simplicity, low cost, and high reliability?","Location of joints can be subjected to | perturbation analysis to minimize joint motions. This program became invaluable for locating the joints to ensure the smallest engine-duct envelope possible. 2.1.1.1.2 Hard Lines | Since flexible bellows joints are more expensive and less reliable than rigid ducting, such ) joints are utilized only if a hard line will not satisfy the design requirements. Hard lines are preferred, if at all possible, in any ducting application, because they offer simplicity in design and fabrication, low cost, and high reliability; their drawbacks, which must be | evaluated and weighed in design-phase trade studies, are loss of interchangeability and high | attachment-point reactions to any applied loads. "
What changes in design philosophy have engine designers adopted regarding duct construction for modern engines?,"The centerline geometry of hard lines thus | is established to minimize the loads on attachment points. Recent experience indicates that some engine designers have changed their attitude toward line design. Ducts originally were designed to include flexible joints, but later engine models i were designed with “hard” ducts. Two such cases are the RL10 engine on the Centaur | upper stage and the F-1 engine on the Saturn V booster (S-IC). "
What material used in later F-1 engines allowed for lower end reactions compared to steel or nickel-base ducting?,"In the early RL10 engine, braided flexible sections were used throughout the ducting; the f present version is completely devoid of flexible joints. Loops and bends in the hard ducts | provide flexiblity. The early F-1 engines incorporated bellows joints in the pump discharge ducts, but these | were later replaced by aluminum hard lines with generous bends for flexibility (fig. 7); the low modulus of elasticity of the aluminum permitted lower end reactions for a given deflection than did a comparable duct of steel or nickel-base alloy. "
What types of bending stresses are produced by different modes of deflection in specific components?,"The change was possible because the ducts were nongimballing and were required to absorb only misalignments and | thermal effects. Manufacturing lead time and costs for the original bellows-joint ducts | dictated the change even though some interchangeability was lost. , | 2.1.1.2 DEFLECTION LIMITATION Different deflection modes (i.e., axial, angular, and shear) produce the same type of bending | | stresses in the bellows convolutions. "
What must be maintained within limits when a bellows deflects in multiple modes simultaneously?,"If a bellows is required to deflect in all of these modes simultaneously, the sum of the deflections for all modes must be kept within acceptable | stress limits.

What measures can be taken in design to reduce torsional effects on duct joints under unavoidable torsional loading conditions?,"Because of the inherent torsional rigidity of a typical duct, | | torsional deflections can be imposed only by high external loads, which must be resisted by the attaching structure. Structural failure or early fatigue failure can be the result. When, | because of design constraints, torsional loading is unavoidable. the torsional effects are minimized by appropriate design. | } The duct system is routed so that torsional deflection imposed on any one joint is minimized. "
"What type of device is used to absorb torsional deflection in short and straight ducts, as specified for pump inlet structures in a specific engine?","If space limitations force a duct to be designed relatively short and straight, so | | that torsional deflections cannot be absorbed through angulation of bellows joints in dog legs of the duct, other means of permitting torsional deflection must be provided.

What are common components in rocket-engine ducting that contribute to high energy losses?,"| | | | 22 | | Ri —eseses—s—“‘“‘i‘i‘i‘i‘i‘i: | Careful analysis of the pressure losses in the individual components gives a high degree of confidence to the engineering judgment involved in weighing that parameter in the design compromise. Typical rocket-engine ducting (and most vehicle ducting) is composed of a series of close-coupled, high-energy-loss components such as bends, branches, valves, expansions, contractions, and flex joints. "
What type of installation configuration typically leads to a maximum pressure loss in a component during flow tests?,"Any prediction of system energy loss based on the test data for individual elements is likely to be very conservative. The reason for this condition is that flow tests made to determine the pressure loss of a particular component | usually are run to evaluate the maximum component loss. The maximum loss is realized | when the installation incorporates a long straight run downstream of the test component; only part of the loss chargeable to the component actually occurs within its confines, the | | remainder arising from flow disturbances downstream of it. "
What is the loss effect ratio of a 180° bend compared to a 90° elbow?,"Obviously, if another component closely follows the first, part of the effect of the first is cancelled. Thus a 180° return bend causes no more than four-thirds the loss of a 90° elbow, or slightly over twice the loss of a 45° elbow. For calibration of a particular component, provision is made to subtract test-setup tare* from total differential pressure. References 6 and 7 provide | detailed procedures. "
What factors are assessed during the evaluation of duct wall thickness for optimal reliability and weight reduction?,"References 8 through 12 treat pressure losses in duct components. | } 2.1.2.2 WALL THICKNESS | } After the duct flow area has been sized, the duct wall thicknesses are determined. Wall | thicknesses are established through a stress analysis, in which the magnitudes of the stresses produced by fluid pressure, fluid flow, thermal gradients, external forces, and acceleration | forces are evaluated so that the optimum thickness for reliability, fabricability, and weight minimization can be selected (ref.12). "
What design elements and structural influences should be considered in structural analysis?,"Methods of calculating stress levels are those | commonly available in strength-of-materials textbooks (e.g., refs. 13 through 15). In the structural analysis, consideration must be given to the following design elements and | structural influences: branches, brackets, doublers, bosses, stiffeners, column buckling, | external collapsing pressure, and mechanical vibration (ref. 16). | Determination of hard-line wall thickness is particularly important because the lack of flexible sections requires that the line itself and its attachment points be capable of handling \ any applied load. "
What principle underlies the determination of minimum wall thickness for hard lines considering operating temperature and pressure?,"The structural analysis of hard lines is based on the maximum envelope resulting from tolerance stackups. The minimum wall thickness, developed from basic thin-shell theory, is based on maximum operating pressure at the ciitical operating temperature and includes the effect of thinning in the bends. The flanges are designed to | develop the axial yield strength of the line at operating temperature. "
What is the minimum safety factor required on combined loading for maximum effective line stress in space-frame analysis?,"Maximum | misalignment, thermal, and discontinuity loads are determined by use of a space-frame analysis. The maximum effective line stress typically is limited to provide a minimum safety factor of 1.4 on combined loading, and 1.5 on ultimate and 1.1 on yield for pressure loading. \ “Basic pressure drop of the test setup only, with the component under test removed. | | | 23 ! | Life considerations for hard lines include both high- and low-cycle fatigue. "
What is the minimum safety factor for the endurance limit regarding effective alternating stress in high-cycle fatigue?,"For high-cycle fatigue, the effective alternating stress due to pressure and vibration usually is limited to provide a minimum safety factor of 1.4 on the material endurance limit. For low-cycle fatigue, the effective peak strain resulting from both primary stresses (pressure and vibration) and secondary stresses (misalignment, thermal, and discontinuity) typically are limited to provide a minimum factor of 4 on cycles. "
What is the minimum wall thickness recommended for hard lines that are 1 inch or larger in diameter?,"The strain levels of hard lines can be up | to twice the yield strain. Yielding during the initial installation will permit operation in the | elastic region for subsequent loadings. | In general, on the basis of fabrication, handling, and maintainability considerations, a minimum wall thickness of 0.032 in. is used for hard lines 1 in. or more in diameter; lines less than 1 in. in diameter have wall thicknesses based on pressure requirements and are | | supported to keep mechanically induced vibration stresses below the material endurance , limit. "
How is the structural integrity of components verified under multiple applied loads during the testing of a final design?,"| All lines are proof-pressure tested. Lines operating at cryogenic temperature may be | proof-pressure tested using liquid nitrogen. Testing of the final design often is performed at | a component level to verify structural integrity under simultaneous application of as many different applied loads as is economically feasible. 2.1.3 Control of Pressure Drop 2.1.3.1 FLOW-DIRECTION CHANGE When engine-vehicle interfaces do not permit a straight-in approach, flow must be directed | into the engine (or pump) through elbows. "
How does the loss coefficient behave as the bend radius to inside diameter ratio increases in elbows with small-radius geometry?,"For flow in a given Reynolds-number regime, the | loss coefficient for an elbow attains a minimum value and then increases as the ratio of bend radius to inside diameter (R/D) increases. If line routing requires small-radius elbows, pressure drop can be minimized by selecting an optimum R/D value for the elbow; otherwise, pressure drop can be minimized by addition of flow guide vanes (fig. 9). In an elbow having a small R/D value, guide vanes provide parallel-flowing elbows of more nearly optimum R/D. "
What is the primary function of flow guide vanes in pump inlets and discharge ducts regarding engine efficiency?,"Flow guide vanes as shown in figure 10 are utilized in sharp elbows at the pump inlets for the Centaur (RL10), Thor, Atlas, and Saturn S-IC (F-1) engines; they have also been used in the pump discharge ducts of the Thor and Jupiter engines. Minimization of pressure drop in all these applications directly enhances engine performance. (References 17 and 18 are sources of design data on pressure loss for flow guide vanes.) Vanes. "
How does aligning branch duct centerlines with mainline flow directions affect the pressure available at the branch?,"can be excited by system fluid oscillations; therefore, vane frequencies are calculated, so that potential vibration may be avoided. | Branch or takeoff duct centerlines are aligned with mainline flow directions to capture ' mainline velocity pressure. This alignment provides higher available pressure at the branch ; 24 ; | | | | FLOW GUIDE VANE (TYP.) N fy FLOW (7 re ys bre | Figure 9. — Typical vaned elbow configuration. "

Minimum tapoff pressure drop is important in applications such as tapoffs from main propellant ducts to gas-generator bootstrap lines. "
What is the significance of transition shape in interfaces where a line begins or terminates regarding pressure loss?,Reference 19 provides information on | optimum takeoff angle. Bellows flow liners (sec. 2.2.4) frequently are used to minimize the high friction losses of | the convolutions. References 20 and 21 provide data on loss factors for liners. 2.1.3.2 FLOW-AREA CHANGE Almost every interface where a line begins or terminates involves an area change to or from the line. The shape of these transitions requires careful consideration if excessive pressure loss from abrupt flow-area changes is to be avoided. 
"How can flow-contraction pressure losses be minimized, and what is the suggested maximum divergence cone angle for expanding sections to achieve this?","Flow-contraction pressure losses can be | reduced by about 90 percent if the edges of the contraction are radiused rather than sharp. | Radii larger than 0.15 times the contracted diameter add little improvement. For expanding | sections, little reduction in pressure loss for a given area ratio can be expected unless the divergence cone angle is kept small (total included angle near 10°). References 22 and 23 treat these phenomena in detail. "
What factors must be considered for effective flow distribution in duct design to ensure similar pressure drop at the exit?,"} | In small-diameter lines with threaded fittings, care must be exercised in calculating the line losses, because standard fittings (unions, tees, elbows, and crosses) usually have a smaller inside diameter than the tubing itself. Reference 24 presents data on loss factors for fittings. | | 2.1.3.3 FLOW DISTRIBUTION The flow distribution (to maintain equal pressure drop) at the exit of engine feed ducting is an important factor in duct design. "
How can pressure loss imbalance affect flow performance in pumps with two opposing discharge outlets?,"For example, the flow profile at pump, valve, and injector entrances can have a great effect on the performance of these components. In pumps having dual opposed discharge ports, the attached ducts must have equal pressure loss to ensure equal flow out of each port. Flow distribution has been improved with vaned elbows (fig. 10) and with “egg-crate” straighteners (fig. 11) downstream of elbows. This | | latter design evolved as a solution to the uneven flow distribution of LOX from the inlet elbow to the injector on the Atlas and Thor engines. "
What mechanism is employed in the Lunar Excursion Module descent engine to ensure equal distribution of flow in the propellant feedlines?,"| The flow splitter in the propellant feedlines of the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) descent engine (fig. 12) represents another flow-directing device for achieving even distribution. The | engine utilizes redundant shutoff valves; in normal operation, both valves open and close simultaneously. However, in a partial failure mode, either of the valves can be closed. Flow into the valves therefore must be evenly distributed for minimum effect on engine performance. "
What device is used to achieve even distribution of flow upstream of control valves in a duct system?,"Even distribution is achieved with the flow splitter in the duct elbow immediately upstream of the valves. 26 | | — | | | | | LOX INLET ELBOW ad wt pas | ‘COMBUSTION | CHAMBER | | EGG-CRATE TYPE FLOW STRAIGHTENER | Arran { easeeance Coo Wey Toy a A-A | Figure 11. — Flow-distribution device incorporating an ““egg-crate”’ ( type of flow straightener. { Y ( { | | ( | CO | 4 y 3 A-R Flow CONTROL VALVE | 9 H phy & if 4 i | bi i FLOW N H Uy — sruitter ft H by N | Me ee | fi Lic\ 4 NX LATA SN | A KAN , A HN INN | PAN) \N (Seay eat tas | LN b ; SHUTOFF VALVES NS an \N | f NSS) INN B B+B ; | Figure 12.

What issue arises from thermal expansion differences in structures that span a duct's diameter within propulsion systems?,"— Flow splitter in propellant feed system of LEM descent engine. g | | | | | | 27 : | | | | | i, abs eae ee a ce hh = ar : ss pus pile’ ee Oe Bis Tey | | One problem associated with flow straighteners or splitters, or any other structure that | rigidly spans the diameter of a duct, is structural loading by differential thermal expansion or contraction. In a duct, the vane usually heats or cools during thermal transients at a faster rate than the restraining duct wall. "
What solution has been identified to accommodate thermally-induced motion between vanes and duct while minimizing load transmission to the wall?,"When this happens, the vanes try to move farther than | the duct will allow. If the differentials are large enough, distortion or destruction of the vanes or duct can occur. The problem is solved by providing an expansion element in the | duct-to-vane connection that will slide or flex, absorbing thermally-induced motion while transmitting minimum loads to the wall. One effective solution has been a sliding clevis joint, which allows sliding normal to the wall but adequately carries the flow loads on the | vane to the wall. "
What effect does increased roughness of duct walls have on pressure loss in fluid flow systems?,"| | 2.1.3.4 FLOW RESISTANCE | | Surface friction between duct walls and the flowing fluid can produce large pressure losses if the walls are rough; as the ratio of roughness-height to duct-diameter increases, so does the | pressure loss. Castings generally have undesirably rough walls and are smoothed to improve flow efficiency. Drawn tubing and sheet metal ducts have been adequately smooth for all | applications, but weld protrusions into the flow stream have to be controlled when they contribute sufficient disturbance to the flow stream. "
What role do weld protrusions play in contraction ratios for small lines compared to larger lines in flexible-joint assemblies?,"Weld protrusions are critical for small lines, where they contribute more to large contraction ratios than they do in larger lines. In flexible-joint assemblies with internal-tie linkages (e.g., chain link, internal tripod with | ball-and-socket bearing, internal gimbal ring), the linkages protrude into the flow stream and | cause head losses. References 25 and 26 present data on pressure loss factors for some of these bellows restraints. "
What type of instability was notably observed in the Titan II during first-stage flight due to interactions between propulsion and structural systems?,| 2.1.4 Control of Pump-Inlet-Line Vibration Virtually every pump-fed liquid-rocket vehicle developed in the United States has | experienced some form of vibrational instability during flight. This vibration first caused real concern in the Titan II in 1962. A significant longitudinal instability occurred late in | first-stage flight. Analysis showed that the vibration was caused by a regenerative-feedback | interaction between the vehicle’s propulsion and structural systems. 
"What is the term used to describe the lengthwise oscillation that affects pump-fed systems, named after a specific type of toy that features bouncing motion?","This lengthwise oscillation was named Pogo, after the motion of a pogo stick (ref. 27). The incorporation of | simple hydraulic-suppression devices into the first-stage propellant feedlines solved the Titan | Pogo problem, and the oscillation amplitude at the payload was maintained within + 0.25 g, a level tolerable to the astronauts in the Gemini spacecraft. Pogo is a system design problem; | | however, duct designers need to be aware of the phenomenon because it can influence their | designs, particularly those of the pump inlet ducts of a pump-fed system. "
What initiates the longitudinal oscillation observed in the closed-loop system regarding the vehicle structure's response?,"| | The longitudinal oscillation involved in Pogo can be described in terms of effects that occur in a closed-loop system. The oscillation can be initiated by a perturbation or pulsation in the | 28 | | | i] | | thrust force that causes a response in the vehicle structure. This structural response applies | accelerations to the propellant feed system. The fuel and oxidizer suction lines of the feed | system respond separately to these accelerations, the result being pressure pulses at the inlet to the fuel and oxidizer pumps. "
What role do the pumps and discharge lines play in relation to the combustion chamber's pressure and thrust during the propellant flow process?,"The pumps and discharge lines act on these pressure pulses : | to transmit a varying rate of propellant flow to the combustion chamber. The combustion | process then generates a pulsating chamber pressure and a pulsating thrust. If this feedback | thrust tends to reinforce the initial perturbation, instability can occur. The devices used to attenuate the flow perturbations in the Titan II feedlines (figs. "
What is the primary function of surge tanks in hydroelectric plants and pumping stations?,"13 and 14) are similar in operation to the surge tanks employed in the pressure regulation of large | pipelines that have water-hammer problems. Surge tanks have been used as pressure-stabilizing devices in the flow lines of hydroelectric plants and pumping stations for | more than 50 years; they serve as a point of pressure relief or cushion whenever there is a sudden change in flow. For vehicle feedlines, however, suppression in a specific frequency | range is required; and this requirement necessitates a specially tuned surge system. "
What is the role of an entrapped gas bubble in a standpipe concerning pressure oscillations in a feedline?,"By selection of the proper damping and spring characteristics, the pressure perturbations in the line can be absorbed by the suppression device and, in effect, uncouple the | engine-to-structure feedback loop. In the-Titan II, an entrapped gas bubble was incorporated in the oxidizer-line standpipe to | provide a cushion or soft spring for the oxidizer mass in the standpipe to act on (fig. 13); | the energy due to pressure oscillations in the feedline can be transferred to this spring-mass | | system by judicious choice of the volume or height of the entrapped bubble. "
What mechanism is used in the fuel feedlines to achieve soft spring action in the accumulators?,"The fuel feedlines incorporated piston-type accumulators that utilize a mechanical helical-spring-and-piston arrangement to provide the desired soft spring action (fig. 14); the fixed mass of the spring and piston along with the mass of fuel in the accumulator provided | the equivalent mass required for a resonant system. The suppression devices were constructed and tuned so that their frequency responses, coupled with the appropriate feedline characteristics, would provide maximum attenuation of pump suction-pressure | oscillations that were excited by tank-structure oscillations. "
What frequency increased to approximately 5.5 Hz around 125 seconds post-liftoff due to changes in the vehicle's natural frequency?,"The combined system could be | optimized for maximum attenuation in a specified frequency range. | Pogo oscillations also occurred in the Saturn V vehicle during boost flight. The frequency involved, 5 Hz, happened to be the natural frequency of the combustion process of the F-1 | | engines and of the entire Saturn V vehicle including the spacecraft. The vibration increased as propellants were consumed, because the natural frequency of the vehicle increased; the | frequency approached 5.5 Hz about 125 seconds after liftoff. "
What was added to the liquid-oxygen feedline of each F-1 booster engine to reduce vibration effects on the crew?,"While not necessarily | destructive, the vibration had to be attenuated because it placed an undesireable | acceleration on the crew. The design solution was to deter the two frequencies by placing a pneumatic spring in the liquid-oxygen feedline of each of the five F-1 booster engines. Cavities in the LOX prevalves for the engines provided convenient volumes for introducing | gaseous helium, which does not condense at liquid-oxygen temperature, to act as de-tuners. "

What component manages the liquid level in the gas-filled accumulator while directing excess fluids to the low-pressure oxygen turbopump?,The system utilizes a gas-filled accumulator to suppress vehicle-induced flow oscillations. Geseous oxygen tapped off the heat exchanger in the oxidizer-tank pressurization system is used as the compliant medium following an initial helium precharge. The system controls liquid level in the accumulator by means of an overflow line that routes overflow fluids to the inlet of the low-pressure oxygen turbopump (LPOTP). 
What component in the Pogo suppression system acts as a capacitance in the liquid oxygen flow circuit?,"The SSME Pogo suppression system is shown schematically in figure 15. As noted, the heart | of the system is the gas-filled accumulator, which serves as a capacitance in the LOX flow , circuit and prevents the transmission of the low-frequency (20 to 30 Hz) flow oscillations | into the HPOTP.

What is the purpose of reducing the number of separable connectors in the assembly regarding weight and leakage?,"— Schematic of Pogo suppression system in LOX feed system on SSME. i | 31 \ | | | 2.1.5 Components The line assembly as an operational unit is composed of a number of items, each performing a specific function. These components are discussed individually below. | 2.1.5.1 SEPARABLE CONNECTORS To reduce weight and overboard leakage, the number of separable connectors (static-seal | disconnect joints) used in the line assembly is kept to a minimum. "
What is a critical requirement for connecting flanges or glands in duct designs to ensure a reliable and lightweight system?,"Orientation of the connectors in the engine or vehicle assembly must provide access for maintenance. Design details of separable connectors are presented in reference 29. | | One of the requirements for a successful duct design is the use of connecting flanges or glands that are rigid enough to maintain the integrity of the static seal. The static seals for } aerospace ducting are fairly sophisticated and expensive devices necessitated by the requirements for a reliable, lightweight system. "
What factors influence the effectiveness of a seal in bolted flanges under operational loads?,"Flanges must have the surface finish, radial | clearances, and rigidity required by the specific seal used. Without sufficient rigidity, bolted flanges are particularly susceptible to rotation (fig. 16) under operational loads, and thus the f | effectiveness of the seal can be reduced. Inadequate bolting can cause the same effect under | operational conditions. In general, it is desirable to keep the bolt circle of the flanged joint | as close as possible to the duct diameter (i.e., to the seal) and to use many small-diameter bolts rather than a few large ones. "
What type of couplings are unsuitable for applications exceeding a pressure of 300 psi?,The toe (outside diameter) of the flange acts as a reaction | point to help prevent rotation. Duct joints with quick-disconnect couplings such as V-bands have not been used successfully | for high-pressure (> 300 psi) applications.

What issues arose from using sheet-metal clamps in flange designs for turbine exhaust ducts in early rocket engines?,"32 { flange for rigidity and seal-tight capability. V-band joints were used in the turbine exhaust ducts of early Atlas and Thor rocket engines, but it was difficult to maintain concentricity of flanges on mating ducts. The sheet-metal clamp also was unable to maintain sufficient | axial load to prevent flange separation and leakage under operating conditions. These | designs therefore were abandoned in favor of bolted flanges. "
What type of joint design was utilized in the Saturn S-IVB feed-duct-to-prevalve connection?,"Not all V-band experience has been negative, however. A modification of the V-band | concept was used on the Saturn S-IVB feed-duct-to-prevalve joint. In this design, a fully machined three-piece clamp, with a 300-psi proof level, was restrained with three tangential | bolts. , 2.1.5.2 MANIFOLDS | A manifold is a duct with one or more flow branches off the main stream (fig. 17).

"
What factors must be considered when designing a system to ensure optimal distribution of flow through various branches?,"The main function of a manifold is to distribute flow from one or more inlet passages to one or more outlet passages. The internal flow areas must be designed such that the flow is split among the branches as functionally desired. If the manifold causes an undesirable flow to a | particular piece of equipment, it has failed in performing its function. | Design problems associated with manifolds involve fluid flow, structural strength, and cleanability. "
Why is pressure-drop analysis critical in the design of flow-distribution devices?,"Since a manifold is a flow-distribution device, careful attention to pressure-drop analysis is paramount to a successful design. Experimental and theoretical data like those available in references 19 and 30 through 35 assist the designer. Laboratory | flow tests of mockup or prototype hardware are performed to verify the analysis. : After the optimum flow passages have been established, they may have to be compromised in order to achieve a practical configuration for fabrication. "
What challenges arise when trying to maintain cleanliness in manifolds with complex passageways and blind ends?,"Typical manifolds are welded assemblies, and the geometry of the branches with respect to the mainline does not always | permit the ideal type of weld joint; mitered joints frequently are required. } Manifolds with many interconnecting passageways and blind ends are difficult to deburr, clean, and inspect for cleanliness. Angled passageways and blind holes are avoided wherever \ possible; straight-through passageways that are easily cleaned and inspected are preferred. "
What is the purpose of a turbine-exhaust-gas manifold in a liquid rocket engine thrust chamber?,"A typical turbine-exhaust-gas manifold for a liquid rocket engine thrust chamber is shown in figure 18. After the exhaust gases pass through the engine’s pump-driving turbines, the gases | Turbine exhaust gas I CONVERGING flows from manifold | MANIFOLD into main exhaust { stream of thrust } 5 chamber | ENG INE es THRUST CHAMBER i“ » i TURBINE by : EXHAUST GAS Wy) I Figure 18. — Turbine exhaust manifold designed tor equal distribution of flow. "
What factors complicate the structural design at the junction of the manifold and the thrust-chamber wall?,"34 | | | are dumped into the mainstream exhaust of the thrust chamber through an annular manifold. The cross-sectional area of the manifold decreases as it wraps around the chamber, so that a constant gas velocity is maintained as the gases are bled off through openings in the thrust-chamber wall. The junction of the manifold and thrust-chamber wall does not permit the best structural design, and the condition is aggravated further by thermal gradients and engine vibrations. "
What types of components are typically integrated into duct assemblies for support and instrumentation in small line assemblies?,"| 2.1.5.3 BRACKETS, BOSSES, AND MOUNTING LUGS Provisions for line mounting or support, auxiliary-equipment support, and instrumentation | | bosses are included in most duct assemblies. In assemblies of small lines (tubing, < 1.25 in. | | diam.), these provisions are accomplished in several ways. Fittings machined from bars or | forgings are butt welded into the tube assembly and can be utilized as brackets, mounting | pads, or instrumentation ports. "
What must be limited during welding to ensure unobstructed fluid flow in tube assemblies?,"For simplicity, and in areas of low stress, bosses or mounting | pads can be machined to fit the tube contour and then fillet-welded to the tube assembly; in | all cases, consideration must be given to limiting the amount of weld dropthrough so as not | to interfere with the flow of fluid in the line. Flanges also can be machined to include a : mounting bracket or attach point, and instrumentaion bosses can be machined into the side of the flange. "
What factors influence the structural integrity of mounting attachments in high-heat-flux applications?,"| In assemblies with line diameters greater than 1.25 in., mounting lugs or instrumentation ports generally are installed on the duct wall by fusion, spot, or seam welding. Spot- and | seam-welded doubler-type mounting attachments have been satisfactory in low-stress, ] low-heat-flux applications; however, structural adequacy in high-heat-flux applications has | not been satisfactory. In hot-gas ducts or hydrogen lines condensing liquid air on their outside surfaces, wall thermal gradients introduce shear stresses in welds that can cause wall | distortion or weld failure. "
What technique can be used to reduce the risk of fluid entrapment in certain attachments that might lead to corrosion?,"Doubler-type attachments are extremely undesirable from a contamination standpoint, because they can readily entrap fluids that can promote corrosion. One method of eliminating this condition is to fillet weld around the periphery of the doubler-type attachment. } | The most desirable method of installing mounting pads or instrumentation bosses in } large-diameter ducts is to machine the bracket or boss to a configuration compatible with | the duct contour. "
What fabrication method is employed to join components in a duct assembly for high efficiency?,"These detail parts then are butt welded into the assembly and inspected radiographically to ensure high joint efficiency. In this joint design, sharp transitions in duct wall thicknesses are eliminated wherever possible, and radii of machined transitions are | | made generous. In large-diameter, thin-wall ducts such as those used in booster vehicles, full | rings that match the duct diameters are butt welded into the duct assembly. "
What considerations must be taken into account when selecting materials for rings used in assemblies?,"These rings | have mounting brackets or attachment points incorporated into the machining of the ring. Rings can also be utilized in duct assemblies in which one or more instrumentation bosses | are an integral part of the machined ring. | | 35 | ! | i eee ee — a ee Sa SP a A Careful consideration is given to the material from which the rings are made. In many instances, bosses, fittings, and rings machined from 321-CRES bar stock leak during leak tests. "
What are three methods to eliminate leakage caused by nonmetallic inclusions in materials during operations such as welding?,"Leakage is of the fuzz* type and is due to nonmetallic stringers in the parent material that are susceptible to fracturing when subjected to any material movement such as that likely to occur during welding, pressure testing, or actual operation. This leakage problem can be eliminated in several ways: (1) use of vacuum-melted 321 CRES; (2) use of forgings rather than bar stock; (3) use of 304L instead of 321 if lower mechanical properties can be tolerated. "
What are the primary purposes of insulating cryogenic feedlines in aerospace applications?,2.1.5.4 INSULATION Cryogenic feedlines are insulated to prevent heat transfer into the propellants for the | following reasons: | @ To maintain quality (temperature and density) of the propellants entering the engine pumps so that engine performance is not degraded i @ To limit propellant boiloff during tanking and chilldown operations ‘ @ To limit propellant boiloff during long vehicle launch-hold periods | @ To prevent geysering in the ducts @ To prevent two-phase flow and attendant increase in pressure losses during engine | operation. 
What are the reasons for limited insulation use on engine lines compared to vehicle propellant feedlines?,"| Cryogenic insulation can be foam, vacuum, vacuum/powder, or vacuum/super-insulation. Uninsulated ducts are also used in certain instances. | Although insulation is used extensively on vehicle propellant feedlines, the use of insulation on the lines of the engines is limited, because (1) the lines are relatively short with little surface area in comparison with long vehicle lines and (2) the mass flows are tremendous once the engine firing commences, so that insulation is of little use. "
What type of insulation was used on the pump discharge and LOX pump inlet lines of the J-2 engines after assembly?,"A cryogenic duct that is warm during ground hold might well be left bare, since in space it will have the benefit of the ambient vacuum. | | The majority of the engine ducts that are insulated have external insulation attached. The | pump discharge and LOX pump inlet lines of the J-2 engines had a foam-type insulation installed after the engine assembly has been completed. Various lines on the F-1 engine were “Leakage rate in the range 0.27 to 2.7x10° sce/sec, | | I 36 | | ; | | equipped with close-fitting nickel-foil/Refrasil blankets to prevent overheating of the line and possible subsequent structural failure due to the heat radiated from the exhaust plume | of the five F-1 engines in the Saturn V first stage. "
How does the application of external insulation impact the choice of line routing in engineering designs?,"The use of external insulation has little effect on the detail design of ducts or lines, but may influence the designer’s choice of line routing because of the need to allow space for the desired insulation. | On the Saturn S-II and S-IVB stages, extensive use was made of vacuum-jacketed fuel (LH, ) feedlines of the initially pumped type. The lines jacketed on the Saturn-II stage were the fuel feedlines, the fuel recirculation lines, fuel vent lines, and the LOX feedlines. "
What factors influence the decision between using a cryopumped vacuum and an initially pumped vacuum for insulation applications?,"On the J-2 engine, vacuum jackets were used on the inlet duct of the gimballed fuel pump and the | gas-generator fuel bleedline. Both these engine lines were in the form of concentric metal | bellows with a cryopumped vacuum. | The main design considerations for the application of vacuum insulation to ducts and lines are as follows: | @ Choice of an initially pumped vacuum (lowest heat leak) or a cryopumped i vacuum y @ Proper ratio of outgassing-surface area to yacuum-chamber volume | @ Proper vacuum-jacket cross-sectional area to permit effective pumpdown | @ Jacket supports with low-heat-leak paths © Cleanability | @ Provision for pressure-relief devices | ® Provision for evacuation valves @ Provision for vacuum measurement | | The magnitude of the allowable heat leakage will govern the choice of a cryopumped | vacuum or an initially pumped vacuum (lowest heat leak). "
What factors must be considered when using a condensible gas in a system designed for effective vacuum insulation?,"Cryopumped vacuums in vacuum jackets initially containing air at atmospheric pressure have proved satisfactory for | liquid-hydrogen lines when the jackets were leak tight. A pure gas condensible at operating temperatures provides a better cryopumped vacuum than air, since air contains traces of noncondensible gases. Some choices for liquid-hydrogen lines are carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. With a condensible gas, attention has to be given to the effect on heat transfer | resutling from possible dislodgement of condensed frost by vibration, and to a method of ensuring that the gas quality is adequate prior to cryopumping. "
What issue arises from atmospheric air leaking into vacuum-insulated engine lines?,"I 37 | | | | | , The most significant problem with vacuum-jacketed engine lines has been controlling the | leakage of atmospheric air into the jackets. Until recently, the jackets have been provided with burst diaphragms or relief valves to relieve internal pressure resulting from expansion of | air that leaked into the cryopumped vacuum. Burst disks (diaphragms of sufficiently low burst pressure to protect the line) have been fragile and have leaked under engine vibration. "
What is the acceptable assembly leakage rate in scc/sec of helium for a properly tested system?,"Relief valves have leaked and then frozen and failed to protect the line during warmup. Because the safety device itself often has caused the leakage problem it was designed to prevent, current practice has been to seal the jacket with a plug-and-seal combination or a | welded plug after a mass-spectrometer leak test has been performed on the entire jacket. | Current acceptable assembly leakage rate is 1 x 10~° scc/sec of helium. "
What type of insulation is utilized in low-heat-leak systems and involves an evacuated space between two reflective surfaces?,"| An all-welded jacket construction requires that the cryopumped gas filling the jacket be compatible with the closing welding process. Argon gas has been successfully used in this | application to provide an inert-gas backup to the closing weld. In low-heat-leak applications such as the large-surface-area propellant feedlines of booster , stages, initially pumped high-vacuum insulation is used. High-vacuum insulation consists of an evacuated space between two highly reflecting surfaces. "
"What are the two primary methods of heat transfer mentioned, and what must structural walls maintain to prevent fluid leakage in low-temperature conditions?","Heat is transferred principally by ; | radiation, but there may be some contribution from gas conduction. Utilization of vacuum insulation requires careful design and precise fabrication techniques. If the vacuum space has the structural duct walls as one of its boundaries, this wall must be | tight enough at cryogenic temperature to prevent leakage of contained fluid into the evacuated space. The other boundary of the insulation space usually is exposed to ambient temperature. "
What factors influence the acceptable leakage rate for insulation performance in a vacuum environment?,This wall must be leaktight under all environmental conditions to which it will | be exposed. Means must be provided to maintain the vacuum integrity in spite of the | differential contraction of the cold and warm boundaries. Helium leak-detection techniques involving the mass spectrometer are used during fabrication. The allowable leakage rate depends on the degree of vacuum required for | optimum insulation performance and the volume of the insulation space. 
What is the acceptable range for helium leakage rates in terms of sce/sec for effective material and welding techniques?,"Leakage rates of 10-° tol0-7 sce/sec of helium are common and are attainable with materials and welding | techniques generally used. | Mechanical joints such as threaded fittings or flanges are not desirable within the vacuum enclosure unless some provision is made to weld the joints so that they are leak tight. | It is desirable to maintain a low ratio (< 4) of outgassing area to vacuum-annulus volume, | because this ratio directly affects the rate of vacuum decay. "
"How does the ratio of an annulus impact the decay rate of vacuum in comparison to other ratios, specifically regarding re-evacuation costs?","For example, with identical line lengths of annuli equally clean and at the same vacuum level, the vacuum in a line with a | ratio of 8 will decay at a rate twice that of a vacuum in a line with a ratio of 4. The part with a ratio of 8 therefore has higher maintenance costs for re-evacuation. | 38 | \ ; | | | | The cross-sectional area of the annulus also is important in that it should be sufficiently large to permit effective vacuum pumpdown within a reasonable amount of time. "
What considerations must be made regarding supports in low-heat-leak applications to minimize heat transfer?,"Also, the structure that supports the jacket shell on the mainline should not restrict molecular flow | | during the pumpdown period. | | In low-heat-leak applications, the heat-leak paths from the jacket to the inner carrier through supports and flanges must be minimized. Supports are required to maintain the | | outer shell of a vacuum line and to attach the ducting to the structure itself in all cases. "
What material is commonly chosen for applications requiring structural strength along with low heat conductivity?,"The longest possible heat path with minimum contact area is desirable. Stainless steel often is used when both structural strength and comparatively low thermal conductivity are desired; several nonmetallic materials (Micarta, Teflon, Kel-F) are applicable when the lower strength is acceptable in favor of improved thermal resistance. | Cleanability of the vacuum jacket surfaces is an important factor in being able to achieve | and maintain a high vacuum. "
What is the term for the process by which gases adhere to the surface of materials after exposure to air?,"Any material that has been exposed to air will have a layer of gas and vapor several molecules thick on its surface; in addition, the interior of metals contains dissolved or occluded gas that is trapped during solidification. Adsorption on | freshly exposed surfaces is very rapid, and the adsorbed gas tends to reach an equilibrium ; with the environmental pressure; evacuation for a long period of time will desorb the gases. "
What types of materials are utilized in vacuum systems for gas adsorption near liquefaction temperatures?,"Application of heat during evacuation will speed the process. } Complete elimination of adsorbed gases is very time consuming and expensive. To attain high vacuum for long periods of time, therefore, it is necessary to make use of adsorbents | ' and getters in the vacuum system. Adsorbents such as metallic zeolites, activated charcoal (not compatible with liquid oxygen), or silica gel are used to adsorb gases near liquification | at the temperature of the contained cryogen. "
What is the primary mechanism through which getters remove gases compared to adsorbents?,"For this reason, the adsorbent package is | located in a low-temperature area. q Hydrogen often is an important constituent of the adsorbed gases. Because of its low boiling point, it is less easily picked up by adsorbents, and therefore even avery small quantity of hydrogen will preclude good vacuum performance. Getter materials are used to remove this hydrogen. The basic difference between a getter and an adsorbent is that a getter cleans up gases by chemical reaction, whereas adsorbents work by surface adhesion. "
What factors influence the efficiency of getter materials used in insulation systems?,"Getters usually | will produce very low pressure levels independently of temperature but the | chemical-reaction rate is speeded up by elevated temperatures. The practice therefore is to locate the getters in the warmest portion of the insulation system. Common getter materials | include active metals, active zeolites, and weak oxides. While getter materials are used largely with jacketed lines in facility or ground support equipment, the concept has direct | application in flightweight lines. "
What design considerations are necessary for service valves in vacuum jacketed duct systems to address evacuation and temperature challenges?,"| Provisions must be made in the duct design for mounting service valves to effect evacuation of the vacuum jacket. These valves usually are welded into the vacuum jacket, as is the case with the S-II stage lines. Problems with Viton and Kel-F O-rings have occurred when these | valves were exposed to temperatures lower than -65°F. Metal-to-metal seals usually alleviate this problem. | i 39 | | f | | | ! Provision also must be made with initially pumped vacuum-jacketed lines for vacuum measurement. "
What is a common application of thermocouple gauges in relation to temperature differences between cold and hot fluids in a system?,"Thermocouple gages commonly are used to fill this requirement. Data on this accessory are available in reference 36. 2.1.5.5 HOT-TO-COLD DUCT INTERSECTIONS | In some line assemblies, a line carrying a cold fluid (e.g., liquid oxygen at -297°F or helium at -360°F) must intersect and pass through a duct containing a hot fluid (e.g., turbine exhaust gas at +1300°F). One particularly difficult situation arises in turbine-exhaust heat exchangers where supply and outlet lines of the cold fluid pass through the wall of the hot-gas turbine-exhaust duct. "
"What are the two methods mentioned for connecting tubes to the duct wall, and why have these methods not proven effective in minimizing thermal stresses?","Reliability of this interface is of utmost importance when the cold fluid is oxygen, because the leakage of oxygen into the fuel-rich turbine exhaust gases can create temperatures sufficiently high to melt and burn the metal. | | | | Many designs have incorporated either tubes welded directly to edges of holes cut in the duct wall or tubes connected to thick flanges welded flush to the duct wall. Neither | approach has been satisfactory for reducing thermal stresses or providing reliable welds. "
What is the purpose of the design used in the J-2S engine's manifold regarding heat protection and flexibility?,A | design used on the J-2S engine incorporates a flanged manifold with stubouts onto which ’ the tubes are welded. The manifold in turn is welded to a somewhat flexible flared portion | of the hot-gas duct wall. This configuration provides a pocket of stagnant gas to protect the { cold manifold from high heat fluxes and thermal stresses and also provides a flexible interface between hot and cold members. 
What factors contribute to large concentrations of bending stress in specific elbow designs in low-pressure systems?,"All weld joints are butt welded and are inspectable | radiographically. 2.1.5.6 ELBOWS In low-pressure systems where tube wall thickness is small with respect to tube diameter (tube wall less than 1/20 tube diameter), and where bend radii are small (bend radius less than 4 times tube diameter), large concentrations of bending stress occur in elbows. The stress may be five or more times the direct bending stress. "
"What type of damage is a challenge during processing, shipping, and installation of duct assemblies with thin walls?","This stress can result in cracking along the mean radius of the elbow unless appropriate design provisions are made (ref. 37). | | i 2.1.5.7 HANDLING-PROTECTION DEVICES Damage to the bellows in the duct assembly and to the duct walls themselves in the case of thin walls (< .030 in.) during processing, shipping, and installation is a continuous problem. | Damage to the static-seal sealing surfaces of the duct flanges also is a problem, and protective covers must be used. "
What is the benefit of using strongback fixtures on either side of a bellows joint in duct systems?,"| Ducts having low-spring-rate bellows can easily be abused in handling by overdeflection of | the bellows. Since the concern is fatigue life of the bellows, a few cycles of gross 40 | | | } | | overdeflection are equivalent, fatigue-wise, to many cycles of normal operational deflection. | Strongback fixtures that attach to the duct on either side of the bellows joint and form a bridge that prevents handling deflection are a good solution for this problem. "
What design feature should protective covers and handling devices possess regarding the assembly of parts they safeguard?,Figure 19 illustrates a strongback fixture and one type of bellows cover. SHELE= TYPE: COVER: FOR BELLOWS (TOP HALF SHOWN) | ~ Re STRONGBACK Ces ; FIXTURE (<=) \ oe | | be wT ii K | ie XS a ix | : C52 | Th USS o SS | SA | Figure 19. — Handling-protection devices for bellows. | It is preferable to design all protective covers and handling devices so that the parts they are | protecting cannot be installed or assembled into the next assembly without removal of the protective device. 
What conditions lead to reduced fatigue life in bellows during operational use?,"If such design is not possible, the minimum requirement is that a red flag be used to warn the user that the protective device is installed. Damage to bellows due to handling during duct fabrication, shipment, and installation into the subsequent assembly is a major contributor to eventual in-service failure. Dents, nicks, and scratches in convolution crowns (the most highly stressed area in a bellows) cause stress | concentrations under operating conditions and thus reduce fatigue life considerably. "
"What types of materials are commonly utilized in rocket fluid systems, particularly for bellows and lines?","Life-reduction criteria based on coupon and bellows fatigue tests have been developed (ref. 38). These data permit material review action on damaged items in the final product that } can result in acceptance of damaged parts that would otherwise be rejected. | 2.1.6 Materials | As noted, the 18-8 corrosion-resistant steels are the most frequently used materials for bellows and lines in most rocket fluid systems; over a considerable length of time, these | materials have performed well. "
What properties make nickel-base alloys preferable for advanced bellows and duct applications compared to aluminum alloys?,"The nickel-base alloys such as the Inconels and the | | | 41 | | Hastelloys are widely used in newer bellows and duct designs because of their higher strengths, greater fatigue lives, and improved corrosion resistance. Aluminum alloys are used sparingly in some noncritical or low-stress applications. Because of the severe forming requirements, only the high-ductility alloys in the annealed condition are used for convoluted sections. "
What type of materials are used for restraint bracketry in cryogenic propellant systems to ensure low-temperature toughness?,Heat-treatable materials are heat treated after forming. Bellows-joint restraint bracketry in cryogenic propellant systems is fabricated from the face-centered-cubic metals to ensure adequate low-temperature toughness. Restraint bracketry in storable-propellant systems is fabricated from high-strength body-centered- or face-centered-cubic steels. The majority of flexible hoses (including wire braid) are fabricated from 321 CRES. 
What factors should be considered when selecting materials for duct assemblies in rocket vehicle and engine systems?,"Other materials, such as Hastelloy C and Inconel 718, are used for special environmental applications. Table I lists the typical alloys used for the fabrication of the subject parts in various rocket vehicle and engine systems. Material selection considerations for the entire line or duct assembly include chemical compatibility with environmental fluids, physical and mechanical properties, formability, | weldability, and the cost of the materials available. "
What factors influence the embrittlement of metal alloys in a high-pressure gaseous-hydrogen environment?,"| 2.1.6.1 CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY : The importance of chemical compatibility of line material with system and environmental 1 fluids cannot be overemphasized. For example, a high-pressure gaseous-hydrogen | environment is known to embrittle many metal alloys (refs. 39, 40, and 41). The degree of embrittlement is a function of the material temperature, environmental pressure, purity of the gas, exposure time, and applied strain level. "
"Which types of materials are more likely to experience embrittlement in hydrogen environments, particularly at elevated pressures?","Steels (ferritic, martensitic, and bainitic), nickel-base alloys, and titanium alloys become embrittled in pure-hydrogen environments at | room temperature; the effects are more pronounced as the pressure increases. High-strength alloys are more susceptible than low-strength alloys. Austenitic stainless steels such as types | 310 and 316; certain aluminum alloys such as 6061-T6, 2219-T6, and 7075-T73; pure copper and beryllium copper; and the precipitation-hardened austenitic stainless steel A-286 are only slightly affected. "
Which alloys are noted for severe embrittlement when exposed to high-pressure hydrogen gas environments?,"Inconel 718, Inconel X-750, Waspaloy, and Rene 41 are severely embrittled in high-pressure gaseous-hydrogen environments. The degradation of mechanical properties by embrittlement generally is reflected in a loss of ductility and fracture toughness. A large amount of experimental work currently is being conducted by industry and government laboratories to achieve better understanding of hydrogen embrittlement and its effects. "
How do gases like hydrogen and water vapor influence the rates of crack initiation and growth in materials?,"This recognition and concern for hydrogen-environment embrittlement is part of a growing recognition of the sometimes dramatic and insidious effects of chemical environments on material properties and hardware performance. The gross effects of corrosion and the less conspicuous effects of stress corrosion are generally well known, and designers are alert to them. | | The presence of hydrogen, water vapor, and other gases can (and does) have a pronounced effect on crack initiation and crack growth rates. "
What is necessary for the practical application of fracture-mechanics principles in designing high-performance materials?,"This change in turn affects conventional | 42 | | | t mechanical properties and can drastically reduce fracture toughness. Recognition of this problem is seen in the fracture-mechanics* approach to the design and development of high-performance hardware. The determination of plane-strain fracture toughness under , identical proof and service conditions is essential to the realistic application of these | concepts. "
What factors determine the compatibility of materials with environmental fluids in chemical applications?,"Chemical compatibility of the line material and environmental fluids (internal and external) | thus involves the following factors: ® Corrosion rates of the material (low corrosion rates are desirable, and the nickel-base alloys have performed well). | ®@ Impact ignition sensitivity of the material (in oxygen, titanium can ignite and oxidize explosively). © Catalytic decomposition of propellants (N,H,, Aerozine-50, or MMH will decompose into large quantities of hot gas in the presence of molybdenum, iron, copper, or silver) (refs. "
What types of materials are particularly vulnerable to crack formation due to acidic environments and stress factors?,"42 through 45). © Material embrittlement and crack initiation and crack growth rates (as discussed | above). | @ Acid attack (absorption of water in N, O, forms nitric acid, which will attack | aluminum alloys). @ Stress corrosion (stress-corrosion cracking has been observed in 321-CRES bellows and is attributed to chlorides from cleaning fluids or unknown sources deposited | on the convoluted surfaces; titanium alloys are susceptible to stress corrosion in uninhibited (brown) N, O,). "
What properties contribute to low thermal stresses in high-heat-flux applications?,"2.1.6.2 PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES | Physical and mechanical properties of importance are primarily high strength (ultimate, | yield, and fatigue), high elongation capability, and low density. A low elastic modulus is | helpful when hard lines require some flexibility. In high-heat-flux applications, high thermal conductivities and low thermal expansion coefficients produce the lowest thermal stresses. "
What design factors are crucial for minimizing thermally induced stresses in joints with different materials?,"Also, joints of dissimilar materials have the lowest thermally induced stresses when the | materials have similar thermal expansion coefficients. Forming limits (minimum bend radii) are important considerations in the design of bellows-convolution shape. Fatigue data are most useful for design of convoluted elements, since the rest of the line usually is designed | for stresses under yield. Some reduction of air-test fatigue allowables is made for aluminum | alloys and corrosion-resistant steels used in N, Oo 4 (ref. "
How do cryogenic temperatures influence the toughness of body-centered-cubic materials?,46). Cryogenic temperatures reduce *A brief discussion of fracture mechanics appears on page 46. | 43 | i | | the toughness of most body-centered-cubic materials. Data on many alloys are available (ref. 47) and are useful in determining the acceptability of alloys that suffer large reductions in fatigue strength. Table III presents data on representative alloys used in flexible lines. Material selection considerations for the convoluted portions of bellows joints or | flexible-hose elements are more extensive than those for the remainder of the line. 
What are the key requirements for materials used in forming convoluted flexible-hose components?,"The most important factors are material formability requirements, corrosion properties, and | low-cycle-fatigue properties. The metal-working operation in forming (convoluting) a bellows or a flexible-hose innercore requires a material of high ductility, more so than for the forming of the tubular portion of the line. Since the convoluted portion is difficult to clean and usually is made of thinner material (typically 0.005 to 0.030 in.) than the rest of the line, corrosion resistance is important if the section is to remain free of pits, holes, cracks, or other leakage paths. "
What challenges are associated with maintaining the integrity of protective coatings during the forming process of components?,"Corrosion-resistant coatings or platings have not been effective because | coverage is inadequate. Coating integrity is difficult to maintain during forming, and | uniform application is difficult after forming. Low-cycle fatigue properties are important in that the bellows are designed for a given number of flexural cycles, while the rest of the line | is designed to keep alternating stresses below the endurance limit of the material. "
What are three essential material characteristics that enhance the performance of hard lines?,"A sophisticated and expensive way to improve corrosion resistance and fatigue life of bellows is to electropolish them prior to forming. | Material characteristics desirable for use in hard lines are (1) high strength-to-weight ratio, (2) good weldability, and (3) good elongation. The following materials have the desired characteristics and provide minimum weight for the given categories of rigid lines: e@ Inconel 718 (high-pressure lines > 1.25 in. "
What property of Inconel 718 makes it suitable for high-pressure applications in large-diameter lines?,"OD) e Armco 21-6-9 (high-pressure lines < 1.25 in. OD and low-pressure lines > 0.75 in. OD) | @ 321 and 347 CRES (all lines < 0.75 in.OD) Inconel 718 is used in the high-pressure, large-diameter lines of the SSME primarily because | of its high strength-to-weight ratio. Inconel 718 may be used in lines that carry hydrogen and operate at cryogenic temperatures, where hydrogen embrittlement is not a problem. "
What is the percentage elongation of Armco alloy 21-6-9 at room temperature?,"| Armco alloy 21-6-9 can be used for the intermediate-size lines, since these lines are gage | limited. This alloy is highly resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. The elongation capabilities of Armco 21-6-9 are comparable to those of Inconel 718: 10 percent at cryogenic temperature and significantly better (40 percent) at room temperatures. This alloy is | annealed and does not require heat treatment after welding. "
What is the minimum yield strength of Inconel 718 as specified in the mechanical properties table?,"321 and 347 CRES can be used in the small lines, which are also gage limited. Hydrogen is not a problem with these alloys.

Which materials commonly used in aerospace components are resistant to corrosion and are suitable for temperatures up to 1200°F?,"Bolt and nut materials used in aerospace applications are inherently corrosion-resistant, the most frequently used materials being A-286, Inconel 718, Inconel X-750, K-Monel, and Rene 41. Material selection is based on the strength level required for the coupling and the service temperature. All of the above materials except Rene 41 are used in applications ranging from cryogenic temperature to 1200°F. "
"What temperature range is associated with good strength levels for the material used, despite its high cost?","Rene 41 is normally used at temperatures in | the 1200°F to 1600°F range because of good strength levels, but high cost restricts it from being used at lower temperatures. Additional details on material selections for threaded fasteners is provided in references 48, 49, and 50. | Fracture-mechanics properties. — Conventional structure analyses account for stress, material strength, and stress-concentration factors at fillets, corners, and holes, but they do not consider flaws and minute cracks inherent in all materials. "
What factors can lead a material to exhibit brittle failure instead of ductile behavior?,"When ductile materials such ' as those used in line assemblies are stressed, they deform plastically around the tips of the | cracks and absorb local overloads. But when a material cannot behave in a ductile | manner — for example, when it is near or below its transition temperature, when strain rate | is high, or when the stress system is complex and the material is physically constrained — it can fail at a relatively low stress level. "
What factors are essential in the design parameters for analyzing fracture mechanics in materials?,"For these conditions, the concepts and techniques of | | fracture mechanics can be utilized for analysis. The concept of fracture mechanics recognizes discontinuity and nonhomogeneity in materials and provides a numerical method to account for minute cracks. The fracture-mechanics design parameters are a toughness (energy-absorption) factor, applied | stress, size of crack, operating temperature, and the ‘‘state of stress”, which is often far more complex than first assumed. "
What aspects are important to consider for ducting and filter design in relation to materials and fabrication?,"Discussion of fracture-mechanics theory and practice is beyond the scope of this | monograph.

"
"What are the main factors determining the severity of sheet metal forming operations, listed in order from least to most severe?","| | 2.1.6.3 FORMABILITY | Formability (high ductility) of materials is important in that most of the line assembly, with | the exception of flanges, bosses, or linkages, is formed from sheet metal. The least severe forming operation is rolling of the tubular elements, followed in increasing severity by forming of (1) bends, (2) fittings and transitions, and (3) the bellows convolutions.

What is the significance of weldability in the context of aerospace programs and permanent joining methods for line-assembly components?,"Weldability of materials is an important consideration, since welding is the most often usedmethod of permanently joining line-assembly elements.

"What type of lubricant is commonly found in Saturn engine systems, and what was a key characteristic influencing its selection?","Platings and lubricants are used on bolts and nuts to prevent thread galling. Silver is the most widely used plating, although others are used when required to solve fluid compatibility problems. The standard thread lubricant used on the Saturn engine systems was a phosphoric-acid-bonded dry-film lubricant. One characteristic that influenced the selection of this lubricant was its impact ignition compatibility with liquid oxygen. "
"What is the applicable temperature span for the dry-film lubricant, from the lowest to the highest temperature it can withstand?",Useful temperature range for this dry-film lubricant is from cryogenic temperatures to +300°F. Platings are used at higher temperatures.. 
What are the two main categories of testing and what type of testing is performed on all production pieces?,"| 2.1.7 Testing Testing usually is divided into two categories: (1) the initial qualification testing, which is later repeated on a sampling basis during production runs; and (2) acceptance testing, which| consists of nondestructive tests made on all production pieces.

What conditions must be avoided when testing unjacketed flight bellows flowing cryogenic fluid to prevent additional damping effects?,"Yielding permitted, plastic distortion permitted, but no leakage. Notes: 1, Unjacketed flight bellows flowing cryogenic fluid should be tested in an environment precluding condensation or air liquification, because either condition could provide viscous damping of vibration. 2. For economic reasons and for better simulation of operational use, some of these tests may be conducted simultaneously For example, the flow calibration may be done during the flow-fatigue test for practical reasons, and mechanical vibration tesis may be combined with flow-fatigue tests. "
"What is the primary factor triggering flow-induced vibration in hoses or bellows according to the heat-transfer characteristics, momentum, and fluid properties?","possible so that all failure modes can be identified. The flow-induced vibration failure of | Saturn AS-502 flexible hoses in flight (ref. 64) is a case in which the lack of yvacuum-environment simulation during component testing was the reason that a significant failure mode was not discovered prior to flight. The mechanism for triggering flow-induced vibration in a bellows or hose is a function of the fluid heat-transfer characteristics, momentum, and bulk modulus. "
What are the two general viewpoints regarding the quantity of samples necessary for the initial qualification of a newly designed system?,"No dimensionless parameter for correlating data from one fluid to another is known; the behavior of a bellows } flowing a fluid other than the end-use fluid may be entirely different from the behavior with the actual fluid. For this reason, the current practice is to use actual end-use fluid for flow testing. | There are two general schools of thought on the number of samples to be tested in the initial qualification of a new design. "
What is the minimum number of samples required to complete all planned tests according to NASA's specifications?,"The NASA requirement is that a minimum of two samples go through all of the planned tests in sequence, decathlon style. Industry practices have sometimes been to run separate samples for each major test (vibration, flexural endurance, etc.), but with more time or cycles applied than required in the NASA method. The samples usually would be tested to destruction after the minimum requirements had | been met, thus giving a measure of the part’s margin of safety for each type of critical test. "
How does elevated environmental temperature impact the fatigue life of metals compared to cryogenic temperatures?,"A discussion of test requirements and conditions is presented in reference 16. The effect of environmental temperature on fatigue life of metals (in standard coupon | shapes) is well known. In general, fatigue life is reduced at elevated temperatures and increased at cryogenic temperatures. For example, the life of 321-CRES bellows at liquid-nitrogen temperature (—320°F) is 4 to 5 times greater than that at room temperature for a given strain level; at liquid-hydrogen temperature (—423°F), life is 10 to 100 times greater. "
What factors are indicated to influence the fatigue life of bellows when subjected to elevated temperatures compared to room temperature testing?,"However, very little fatigue testing at high or low temperatures actually has been | performed on bellows for design-evaluation or production-comparision tests. Usually, | acceptability is based on results of a room-temperature test that gives little more than an | indication of actual life at operating temperatures. For example, for a Hastelloy-C bellows on a J-2S heat exchanger, the fatigue life at 800°F, under the same deflections, was approximately one-third the life at room temperature. "
What type of test is primarily conducted to ensure the structural integrity of components in aerospace applications during production?,"Testing at operational temperatures during initial qualification tests provides a good basis for assurance that the later quality-control sampling tests at room temperature are adequate. | For bellows intended for aerospace application, manufacturing procedures normally require proof- and leak-test certification of every piece in a production lot. Proof testing is primarily a structural integrity test. "
What medium is typically preferred for testing due to its lower energy release in the event of a rupture?,"Water rather than gas commonly is used as the test medium because, in case of a burst, much less energy is released from water. Distilled or deionized | water is employed, because tap water can deposit chlorides on the bellows surface and promote cell corrosion or intergranular corrosion within a very short time (refs. 65 and 66). | For bellows or ducts that operate at elevated temperature, it is common practice to perform ’ 50 j | | | the acceptance proof-pressure test at room temperature. "
How is test pressure adjusted to account for changes in material properties due to elevated temperatures?,"The test pressure level is increased to compensate for the effect of elevated temperature on material properties. The proof | | pressure simply is multiplied by the largest ratio of the room-temperature value to | elevated-temperature value for yield stress, ultimate stress, or elastic modulus; this pressure then is used as the test pressure. The mass spectrometer is a generally accepted device for verifying bellows leak tightness. "
What are the typical leakage rates detectable by the mass-spectrometer leak detector in terms of scc of helium per second?,"| The mass-spectrometer leak detector (MSLD) is capable of detecting leakage rates (i.e., has a | leak sensitivity) of about 10? scc of helium/sec. The MSLD test is preferred for accuracy , over the test with gas-pressurized bellows submerged in water, because the surface tension of the water is capable of sealing minute pinholes or cracks in the bellows wall, and at small | leakage rates the water can dissolve a leak bubble as it is formed; leak sensitivity with | bubbles is 10-? scc/sec. "
What is the sensitivity level of a neutral aqueous solution of surfactants used for leak detection in relation to bellows materials?,"Soap or detergent leak-detection fluids have been found to cause | stress corrosion of bellows materials; however, a neutral aqueous solution of surfactants (per | ref. 67) has been used safely and has a sensitivity of 10~* scc/sec. | | The end-use configuration is simulated as closely as possible in test setups so that all | conditions to which assemblies will be subjected can be evaluated. For example, both the | J-2 and F-1 engines have numerous fluid-carrying lines that must cross the interface between | engine and vehicle. "
How does the clamping of flexible hoses on the J-2 engine influence the stiffness and deflection distribution of the assembly?,"The lines are flexible to accommodate gimballing motion. On the J-2 | engine, all the lines are flexible hoses and are clamped together to assist in maintaining their relative positions. This clamping affects the distribution of the line assembly deflection | | among the individual flexible-hose sections in the line and adds to their overall stiffness. On the F-1 engine, the flexible hoses cross the gimbal plane and are attached to nongimballing | flexible hoses on the engine; this configuration influences their deflection. "
What is the impact of circumferential weld dropthrough on the performance of small-diameter hose assemblies?,"Good practice, | | then, is to test all lines clamped together as a bundle. | Acceptance tests are performed for quality assurance on all welded components. | Circumferential weld dropthrough can cause an increase in pressure drop of hose assemblies that is sufficient to affect engine performance. Small-diameter (< 1.25 in.) lines are especially sensitive and are checked during acceptance by passing a ball gage completely through the assembly. "
What parameters are typically measured during the qualification assessment of aerospace ducts including flexible hoses and bellows?,"| Testing of aerospace ducting involves extremes of temperature, large pressure forces, high-pressure gas generation from cryogenic fluids, combustibility, and toxicity; | considerable caution therefore is exercised in the design and operation of test programs. | References 16 (p. 30) and 68 present details on test programs. | 2.1.7.2 TEST INSTRUMENTATION | Typical parameters measured on lines, bellows, and flexible hoses during development and | qualification testing include static and total pressure, temperature, flowrate, strain, and | 51 | | | vibration response. "
What precautions should be taken when using turbine meters in cryogenic applications to avoid potential blade or bearing failures?,"Pressure and temperature measurements are obtained with standard low-frequency pressure transducers and thermocouples. Orifice meters, venturi meters, and | turbine flowmeters are utilized for flowrate measurements. Turbine meters must be used ! with caution in cryogenic service where overspeeding can occur during chilldown of the | system, when the gas velocity is much higher than the liquid velocity for which the meter is design; blade or bearing failure can be the result. "
Which measurement method was found to be most effective for assessing the performance of bellows in relation to vibration frequencies?,"Pressure, temperature, and flow measurement techniques outlined in reference 69 are extremely useful. | One of the most recent developments in instrumentation, unique to flexible ducting, has been the technique for measuring frequencies of flow-induced vibration and “g’’-forces on | bellows. Methods evaluated involved microphones, radiography, strain gages, and miniature accelerometers. The accelerometers proved most effective for braided flexible hoses, whereas strain gages, mounted on the crowns of bellows convolutions, were most effective for bellows. "
What is the maximum attrition rate observed for gages during testing in low-temperature conditions?,"The attrition rate on gages during flow tests is high (up to 50%), especially under cryogenic conditions. Strain gages have been used on bellows inside wire-braided flexible hoses, but installation of gages requires great care, whether they are installed before | the braid is assembled to the hose or afterwards, when the braid wires must be compressed | locally to form a window for the innercore; the braid window is retained by local soldering | to permit access for affixing strain gages to the convolution. "
What is the maximum vibration frequency of bellows in pendulum mode under cryogenic conditions?,"Vibration frequencies of bellows, particularly those of pendulum mode in braided hoses, can \ be as high as 60 kHz under cryogenic conditions. Frequencies of this magnitude normally are filtered out in the measuring circuit of the standard, high-frequency, rocket-engine-vibration instrumentation. By removing the filter and taking advantage of the voltage-vs-frequency curve to complement the voltage-vs-temperature curve, a usable “flat | response”’ output within approximately 10 percent of the mechanical/electrical resonance of { the mounted accelerometer can be obtained. "
What components typically make up a flexible pressure-carrying assembly in piping applications?,"2.2 BELLOWS JOINT A bellows section (or joint) in a line generally consists of three parts: a flexible | pressure-carrying convoluted tube (the bellows), a restraint on the bellows to handle the pressure separating load, and a provision for attaching the bellows to the line. In most cases, a fourth part —a flow liner for the bellows — is incorporated. Photographs of typical bellows joints are presented in figure 20. "
What are the four types of motion that a bellows joint can accommodate at its ends?,"A bellows joint in ducting can absorb motions (deflections) with much smaller reaction loads than those that develop in a hard line. A free bellows can absorb four kinds of motion applied to its ends: (1) axial (extension or compression), (2) offset (with end planes parallel), (3) angular (about its center), and (4) torsional (about its axis). Typical | applications may impose one, all, or any combination of these end-point motions | (deflections) on a bellows. "
What type of device is constructed to prevent buckling in bellows while providing external restraint?,"Various restraining devices or linkages are designed to limit a { 52 | j | ii lla th —————=,_ & . = é = = —— (a) Compression-type bellows (b) Externally restrained, j externally restrained double-shear gimbal- against buckling jointed bellows i, z ""WW Yaa a adh ‘ ; = a i ra i L > 3 - (c) Externally restrained (d) Internally restrained bellows: tension-tie bel lows internal tripod with integral ball and socket t j Figure 20.

Identify four distinct types of flexible connection devices that utilize material expansion and contraction to accommodate specific movements.,"— Four examples of bellows joints. | 53 ' bellows to absorb only certain motions (e.g., a gimbal ring linkage allows a bellows to receive only angulation). These end-point motions and the number of motion cycles that a bellows joint is designed to absorb are accurately determined in the line-assembly design phase. Unfortunately, a bellows must absorb vibratory motions that are either flow induced by the internal fluid motion or mechanically induced by motion of the engine or its components. "
What factors can lead to failure in bellows when subjected to high-frequency motions and significant amplitudes?,"These bellows motions are not related to those described above; they usually occur as motions of the convoluted section in a variety of modes with the ends of the bellows fixed. The magnitudes of these motions are difficult to predict, and the frequencies are sometimes several thousand cycles per second. Motions at these frequencies that produce amplitudes | and attendant stresses above the fatigue limit of the bellows material can cause failure in | only a few seonds. "
What design considerations must be implemented in a duct system to prevent bellows from changing length due to high pressure loads?,"The pressure separating load on a bellows in a duct system is developed, as if the bellows | were a pressure vessel with end caps, by the duct pressure reacting against a projected area , across the duct bore (e.g., an elbow, an injector face, or any other reaction point in the system). Bellows have low spring rates and thus cannot withstand very high pressure ! separating loads without changing length; therefore, restraint mechanisms to prevent this change must be used to enable the bellows to perform its function in a duct assembly. "
What are the general design applications of bellows in vehicle and rocket engine ducting?,| Information on axial-restraint design and stress analysis is provided in references 70 through | 74. Information on the use of bellows in general design is presented in references 75 through 81. Basic considerations involved in the successful design of a bellows joint are presented in the sections that follow. 2.2.1 Bellows Bellows have been used successfully in vehicle and rocket engine ducting in a wide range of | sizes under a variety of operating conditions. 
What factors influence the design of bellows used in aerospace ducting to ensure effective operation and minimized weight?,"However, success is dependent on careful design, as bellows generally operate in the plastic range of the bellows material. This | condition is necessary so that the wall thicknesses can be reduced sufficiently to produce acceptable end-restraint reaction loads with the bellows in a deflected position and to | | reduce weight. | Formed, straight-side-wall bellows are the predominant type used in aerospace ducting. "
"What is the primary application for welded-disk bellows, and why are they not suitable for aerospace ducting?","Welded-disk bellows, the other major type, are not used in any aerospace ducting | application; their use is limited to rotary-shaft face-seal applications, where long strokes in relatively short lengths are required. The crown and root weld locations create a blind root notch that increases stress. Minor flaws have a tendency to propagate rapidly unless low-magnitude stresses are maintained. , ! 54 | | — —EE = ia | 2.2.1.1 PRESSURE CAPABILITY. "
What types of pressure must a bellows withstand during its operation?,A bellows must cope with several kinds of operational pressure: | @ Normal operating pressure | | @ Surge pressure | @ Proof pressure [(mormal operating pressure + surge pressure) X safety factor | | © Burst pressure (proof pressure X safety factor). | These pressures produce hoop stresses in the bellows and bulging stresses that tend to bulge | the convolution sidewalls. The bellows must be stable and resist column buckling under the | proof-pressure application. 
"What stresses must be considered when evaluating the performance of bellows, despite calculated operational stresses exceeding material yield strengths?","While subject to the burst pressure, the bellows is permitted to | deform and take permanent set but not to develop leaks. The calculated operational stresses are startlingly high, exceeding the yield strengths of the materials, but in reality are only index stresses and must be treated as such. The limiting bulging stresses and allowable motion stresses (bending stresses) of frequently used bellows materials are given in table V. "
What is the frequency range for full stress reversals in cycles described in the context?,"Cycles are full stress reversals at a frequency of 30 to 60 per minute. Stresses are calculated with the equations presented in reference 16 (p. 72); | different types of motion (axial, lateral, angular) can be converted into equivalent axial motion with equations given therein (p. 73). | | Table V. — Limiting Bulging Stresses and Allowable Motion Stresses of Frequently Used Bellows Materials | = | 321,347 CRES | Cold worked as formed; 140 000 120 000 120 000 74 000 | R, 10 to 40 | A-286 Heat treated; 200 000 160 000 200 000 120 000.

"
What are the two primary factors influencing the design for low-cycle fatigue life in flexible-duct assemblies under high-stress conditions?,"2.1.5.7) Other causes of bellows failures that have occurred less frequently are implosions in LOX or high-temperature service, and bursting due to pressure surge. | | 2.2.1.2 FATIGUE LIFE | | The end-point motions of a flexible-duct assembly impose the largest deflections on the bellows joints within the duct. These motions are predictable in the design phase, as is the anticipated duty cycle. With the use of this information and the S-N (alternating stress vs number of cycles) properties for the particular materials involved, the bellows then can be | designed for an adequate low-cycle fatigue life while operating under very high stresses. "
What is the impact of thin wall design on the spring rates and fatigue life of bellows in aerospace applications?,"Since aerospace design emphasizes light weight, bellows are characterized by thin walls. Thin walls reduce the weight of the bellows itself and also reduce spring rates, so that the reaction | loads on attaching members are low and their weight thus is kept to a minimum. This | 56 | | thin-wall feature dictates that the bellows operate under stresses near or in the plastic range, and fatigue life in the low-cycle range is a result. "
What factors must be considered in the design of bellows to prevent reducing the material's fatigue life?,"Reference 82 presents low-cycle fatigue data for bellows made from 321 CRES and nickel-base alloys. Other motions imparted to the bellows come from vibrations that are induced mechanically or by the fluid flow. The bellows must be designed such that the stresses incurred are kept below the endurance limit of the material (i.e., no reduction in fatigue life is caused by | vibration). | Methods for predicting flow-induced vibration inputs are presented in references 83 through 90; these techniques utilized in bellows design can enable the designer to develop a bellows completely free from vibration or at least free from unacceptable levels of vibration. "
What challenges arise in forecasting vibration inputs for flexible duct systems in complex structures?,Prediction of mechanical vibration inputs is more difficult because of the dynamic complexity of the structure to which the flexible duct is attached. One method is to extrapolate known vibration inputs from similar installations on other engines and compare them with calculable mechanical resonant frequencies of the duct design; a more accurate but costlier method is to build prototype hardware and test it on development engines while the vibration environment is measured. 
"What is the most common failure mode for a bellows operating in a vibrating environment, and where are the cracks typically located?","If a bellows operates in a vibration environment containing excitation frequencies matching any of the natural structural frequencies of the bellows, its fatigue life can be exceeded within a short operational time period. The most frequent bellows failure mode is the development of a fatigue crack that permits leakage through the convolution. The cracks usually are circumferentially located in the crowns or roots of the convolutions, since these are the areas of maximum bending stress. "
What must be maintained during operational periods when various types of dynamic loads are applied to a flexible component?,"Analysis of past fatigue failures indicates they have been caused by flow-induced vibration (sec. 2.2.1.2.2), mechanical vibration (sec. 2.2.1.2.3), or a combination of the two (sometimes aggravated by overdeflection handling abuse). Successful bellows are those designed with adequate fatigue margins that allow for all of these influences. 2.2.1.2.1 Vibration Susceptibility Structural integrity must be maintained during and after the operational periods when many types of dynamic loads may be applied to a bellows. "
What are the three primary modes of vibration observed in bellows?,"The types of loads include those | generated by the enclosed fluids (e.g., pressure surging [Pogo, water hammer, pump oscillations] and flow-induced vibration) and those imposed by mechanical environments (e.g., sinusoidal vibration, random vibration, shock, noise, and steady-state acceleration). | There are three primary modes of bellows vibration (fig. 21): (1) the axial or accordion mode, (2) the lateral mode, and (3) the mode in which the individual convolutions rotate back and forth at the inner diameter while pivoting about the outer diameter.

What are the challenges in predicting the excitation frequencies and amplitudes that affect bellows vibrations?,"— Three primary modes of bellows vibration. | For a given bellows design, the frequencies of these modes can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (refs. 83 through 94). The difficult problems are determining (1) the frequencies and amplitudes of flow or mechanical vibratory forces that may excite these modes and (2) the possible response characteristics of the bellows to these forces. | 2.2.1.2.2 Flow-Induced Vibration Flow-induced vibration of flexible-line bellows with resultant fatigue failure is a frequent problem in lines containing fluids flowing at high velocities. "
"What issues can arise from the installation of an internal flow liner in bellows related to design, fabrication, and maintenance?","In bellows, an internal flow liner (sec. 2.2.4) has always resolved the problem by preventing impingement of the flow stream on the convolutions; however, the installation of the liner usually presents complications in design and fabrication and makes the bellows more difficult to clean. The liners themselves have failed, apparently as a result of vibration. Flow liners appear to be the | best “quick fix’”’ or empirical solution to flow-induced vibration, but not necessarily the best solution. "
What recent experiences influenced the investigation into flow-induced vibrations on the Saturn AS-502 vehicle?,"References 95 and 96 give examples of quick-fix solutions to some Saturn ducting problems. | 58 | | | Not much is known about the actual physical phenomena involved in flow-induced | vibration; however, the recent experience with flexible-line failures on the Saturn AS-502 vehicle instigated an intensive investigation that greatly advanced the state of the art in | understanding and preventing vibration failure (refs. "
What analytical method was developed to assess the vulnerability of flexible lines to vibrations caused by fluid flow?,"28 and 97). The Saturn AS-502 failure investigation culminated in an analytical method (ref. 90) for determining whether a flexible , | line is susceptible to flow-induced vibration. The analysis evolved from the results of a test program utilizing more than 50 different flexible line and duct specimens (refs. 64 and 98). | | The analysis determines the dynamic response and fluid excitation required to cause fatigue failures associated with the individual-convolution vibration mode. "
What factors influence the response characteristics in an individual-convolution mode related to fluid dynamics and structural interactions?,The essential dynamic consideration is that the response characteristics for the individual-convolution mode are the result of coupling of the structural dynamics of the conyolutions and the dynamics of the fluid within the convolutions. The excitation due to fluid flow within the flexible line is | described as being capable of exciting a band of response frequencies where the boundaries of the excitation frequencies are proportional to velocity. 
What type of frequency is linked to the speed of fluid moving past evenly distributed surface irregularities?,The low-frequency excitations generally are associated with vortex shedding within the turbulent boundary layer. The | high-frequency (and potentially much stronger) excitation is associated with a convection frequency in the turbulent boundary layer. The convection frequency is defined as the characteristic frequency associated with the fluid velocity past equally spaced wall irregularities (the convolutions). 
How does acoustic loading influence the degrees of freedom in a flexible system and what effect does it have on pressure fluctuations?,"| | Acoustic loading can increase the number of degrees of freedom of a bellows system by coupling the bellows to the acoustic modes. When this type of coupling occurs, very significant pressure fluctuations can be propagated throughout the fluid system. These acoustic resonances, in addition to producing noise, cause a significant increase in the flow-induced stress levels. This effect apparently is the result of the acoustic-resonance flow | and pressure fluctuations coupling with the vortex shedding process to produce a force amplification. "
"What is the method for estimating energy levels related to resonance, and how does it connect to assessing stress limits for fatigue failure?","This phenomenon is discussed in detail in references 85 through 89. | If a resonance can exist, the analysis provides a technique for estimating the energy levels | associated with the resonance; the energy available can then be translated to a stress level in | the part. When the expected stress level is known, a quantitative evaluation then can be | made to determine if the stress level exceeds the alternating stress that the part is capable of withstanding without high-cycle fatigue failure. "
What is the purpose of employing analytical methods in assessing vibration susceptibility during the design phase of a flexible-line?,"The detailed analytical methods for determining flow-induced vibration excitation and | response dynamics are presented in reference 90. Useful response information also appears in references 91 through 94. These analytical methods provide for determining, with a high | confidence level, the flow-induced vibration susceptibility of a given flexible-line design for a given set of operating conditions while still in the design phase; these techniques thus eliminate the need for expensive cut-and-try flow testing of prototype hardware. "
What was the commonly held belief regarding multi-ply bellows in relation to the flutter issue prior to recent developments?,"| Before the sudden surge in activity on flow-induced vibration of bellows brought about by the failure of flexible lines on the Saturn AS-502 vehicle, it was commonly believed that the | | | multi-ply bellows, because of the friction damping between plies, was a solution to the | flutter problem. Many experiences (e.g., those involving the bellows on the Thor pump |. "
What role does multi-ply material play in damping compared to single ply in flexible line applications?,"discharge line, and bellows on the helium inlet duct on the F-1 heat exchanger) proved thatmulti-ply in itself was not the solution.

The multi-ply does provide some damping over the single ply (refs. 84 through 88), but if the natural structural frequency of the |"
What is the consequence of a convolution shape that aligns with stimulating frequencies?,"convolution shape involved coincides with exciting frequencies, failure is likely to occur."
What are the challenges associated with predicting the amplitudes and frequencies of mechanical excitation inputs in a given system?,"| 2.2.1.2.3_ Mechanically Induced Vibration The vibration-response characteristics for a given mechanical excitation input are calculated | | in the same manner as those for flow-induced vibration. It is relatively simple to predict | flow-induced excitation inputs, but it is extremely difficult to predict the | mechanical-excitation amplitudes and frequencies of the components or system in which the | | bellows will be installed. "
What role do accelerometer measurements play in identifying excitation frequencies and acceleration forces during engine development?,"Experience in the analysis and experimental correlation of similar | systems is an invaluable asset in this endeavor, and the best analysis possible is made prior to | design release. The excitation frequencies and acceleration forces sometimes are not accurately identified | | until accelerometer measurements are made on the actual hardware in engine testing during development. An analysis of the effect of these inputs on the flexible ducting and bellows is | then made, and design changes are incorporated, if necessary, before committing the design | to production. "
What design approach is utilized to prevent natural-response frequencies from coinciding with known excitation frequencies in specific applications?,"In some applications, only frequencies of potential exciters are known (e.g., | functions of known pump speeds). In this case, bellows are deliberately designed to keep | natural-response frequencies from matching excitation frequencies. | ; | Double-bellows-spoolpiece arrangements (fig. 22) with an undamped or unsupported span |.

"What are the two forms of instability that can result from buckling, and how do they differ in appearance?","Buckling of the bellows can result from excessive internal or external pressure.| Internal-pressure buckling takes the form of column instability, whereas external-pressure | buckling appears as crushed convolutions.If the bellows is designed properly initially, buckling can occur only when operating |conditions beyond the original specification requirements are imposed on the part.

Bellows have || residual stresses as a result of cold working; being thin walled, bellows thus are particularly |"
"What factors contribute to the corrosion of bellows surfaces, particularly in relation to chloride presence?","| | } | vulnerable to eventual leakage caused by stress corrosion. Chlorides, deposited on the bellows surface by everything from contaminated water to perspiration from a sweaty palm, | typically have been the corrosion promoters. Chlorides used in cleaning agents can be | entrapped in geometric crevices such as close-pitch convolutions. Cryogenic fluids cause moisture to condense and freeze on the outside surfaces of engine ducting and then act as an electrolyte with chlorides or other contamination deposits to promote corrosion. "
What methods are employed to ensure the integrity of hardware in service during inspections and leak checks?,"This problem is dealt with on existing hardware in service by periodic leak checks and inspections, with replacement of unfit hardware, and by continuous efforts to maintain a | moisture-free controlled environment. | The storable (noncryogenic) propellants used in the Titan Il, Apollo Command Module, and LEM ascent and descent stages do not create copious amounts of condensate, and the hardware has not been subject to corrosion. "
"What are the main manufacturing challenges associated with the production of formed, straight-side-wall, convoluted bellows?","Many storable propellants, however, are very | | corrosive, and selection of compatible materials for service in contact with these fluids is an | important design problem (refs. 42 through 45). | | 2.2.1.5 MANUFACTURING | The main problems in the manufacture of formed, straight-side-wall, convoluted bellows | | have involved material thinning, proper heat-treatment control, proper welding, and convolution stackoff. "
What is the typical percentage of wall thickness reduction achieved during the forming of roll-formed bellows?,"| | Thinning of the convolution crowns during the forming process is a common occurrence | with roll-formed bellows. With this type of forming process, thinning 10 percent below the ' | nominal wall thickness is attained. Hydraulic forming processes have less trouble with thinning, and thinning 5 percent below nominal wall thickness is attainable. The consequence of thinning is that more deflection takes place in the thinned section because | stiffness is reduced, and therefore high stresses and early fatigue failure can occur. "
What factors should be adjusted if variations in initial tube thickness are detected during production?,"Thinning can be controlled by dimensionally examining sample pieces in a production run and by | subsequently adjusting initial tube thickness, tooling, or production techniques if variation from the norm appears. | | Proper control of heat treatment requires constant quality-assurance surveillance, because (1) | | bellows performance is degraded by improper heat treatment and (2) bellows usually are | heat treated in lots; improper heat treatment can then be costly in requiring reprocessing or replacing the entire lot. "
What are the potential consequences of inadequate atmosphere circulation during the heating process in a furnace or retort?,One typical problem has involved maintaining the proper | atmosphere in the furnace or retort during the heating process. Circulation of the | atmosphere must be maintained to ensure coverage of all bellows surfaces; the spaces between convolutions are particularly restrictive to good flow coverage. Result of improper | heat treatment can be lower-than-design strength and possible pressure or fatigue failures. 
What factors can contribute to the reduction of fatigue life in materials due to surface characteristics?,"| Surface effects such as oxidation and “orange peel” also can take place and reduce fatigue life because of the notch stress raisers created. | | 62 | | | | | } | Welding problems stem largely from lapses in quality control and workmanship. Ideally,'all welds are inspected radiographically. However, some welds such as resistance welds and lap fusion welds inherently have the gap between the materials being joined show up on the X-ray film as cracks, which are difficult to interpret. "
What issue may occur if the resistance weld is not consistent in dimension around the circumference of a component?,"These welds can be controlled by periodic sectioning and examination of production parts and control of the welding processes and operators. ! | A typical weld problem involves the resistance welding of plies at the neck of the bellows | (fig. 23(a)). Prior to fusion butt welding in the next assembly, this weld is trimmed through the nugget. If the resistance weld is not maintained within the same dimension from the end | of the bellows (i.e., if the weld is wavy as it progresses around the circumference), trimming with a normal cut will not always pass directly through the nugget center and may even cut through the weld completely in localized sectors. "
What methods can improve the quality of fusion welds in bellows assemblies?,"This condition makes it very difficult to make the fusion weld to the next assembly, and considerable grinding out and rewelding are required to achieve an acceptable radiograph. The problem can be resolved by either controlling the distance of the weld from the end of the bellows or widening the weld nugget. } BELLOWS NECK | NUGGET STACKOFF | (ECCENTRICITY) OVERALL \ £ eo == LENGTH Wavy resistance welds makes trimming thru nugget difficult OUTSIDE DIAMETER | (a) BELLOWS-NECK RESISTANCE WELD (b) CONVOLUTION STACKOFF | Figure 23. "
What is the term used to describe the misalignment of convolutions in a bellows fabrication?,"— Two examples of problems in bellows fabrication. | Convolution stackoff is the eccentricity of the convolutions of the bellows with respect to each other. Since the condition is inherent in the tooling of the fabrication method, all of the eccentricity is accumulated in the same direction (fig. 23(b)). This accumulation can be | controlled by rotating the tube after the forming of each convolution. "
What challenges arise in aligning large-diameter components during assembly due to misalignment caused by stacking?,"Such control is important in fabrication, because stackoff results in difficulty in aligning the bellows for | welding into its next assembly. Shear forces must be applied to the part to align it in a | | | 63 (iat tiie straight position, and once the restraining forces are relieved, the bellows will assume its natural stackoff position. Stackoff is more noticeable in large-diameter ( > 6 in.) bellows, but can exist in any size. "
What effect does a smaller length-to-diameter ratio of the bellows have on lateral stiffness and stackoff?,"| Careful manufacture can reduce the amount of stackoff, but it must always be considered. Stackoff becomes more noticeable and more significant when the bellows is in the compressed mode and when the bellows has a small ratio of length to diameter. In this | respect, the rapid increase in lateral stiffness as this ratio becomes smaller contributes to the significance of stackoff. ; | 2.2.1.5.1 Interply Lubricants The tubes forming the multi-ply construction are slipped together concentrically during fabrication of the bellows; a very tight fit is required and sometimes a lubricant is used. "
What requirements must a lubricant fulfill to be suitable for use in applications involving liquid oxygen?,"Because of the tight fit, it is difficult to remove the lubricant after the tubes are engaged. Thus, the lubricant must be chemically compatible with the service fluid, particularly with LOX if the part is to be used in LOX service; it must also be nonvolatile at operating | temperatures to prevent interply pressurization. | Failures have occurred in multi-ply bellows used in LOX and in high-temperature ducts | when contaminants trapped between the plies vaporized during operation (or reacted violently when they came in contact with LOX that entered through a crack) and caused sufficient pressure to burst the bellows (ref. "
What term is used to describe the failure mode where rapid pressure buildup leads to the inner ply bursting?,"104). The word “implosion” is used to describe the failure mode, because the rapid pressure buildup causes the inner ply to burst into the flow stream. Solid dry-film lubricant (e.g., molybdenum disulfide) has been utilized successfuly as an | assembly aid; since it is a solid, it creates no volume-expansion problem when heated. | A successful method for removing lubricant or moisture is to bake the bellows after forming and before the plies at each end of the assembly are circumferentially welded together. "
What is the purpose of vent holes in a bellows-forming process during the baking phase?,"If a particular bellows-forming process necessitates welding the tubes circumferentially prior to forming to prevent ply slippage, vent holes are located adjacent to the weld in each of the plies; the vent holes permit outflow of trapped vapors during the baking process after forming. A second circumferential weld is then made inboard of the vent holes, and the | bellows neck is trimmed to eliminate the hole areas. "
What method ensures the absence of interply lubricants and maintains the necessary clearance during the formation of convolutions in nested tubes?,"This procedure prevents contamination from enterring between the laminations once the part is in service. Because of the failures that have resulted from interply lubricants, the practice of using lubricants has been largely discarded by bellows suppliers. The ply tubes are nested | concentrically without lubricant, and the additional clearance required between tubes is taken up by hydraulic sizing prior to forming the convolutions. "
What factor significantly influences the performance of a bellows joint in relation to its connection to adjoining ducts?,"64 ' | ‘ a | | 2.2.1.5.2 Weld Necks | The success or failure of a bellows joint often depends on the detail design involved in the | integration of the bellows-to-duct interface. In preferred configurations, the weld neck inner diameter (ID) is equal to the bellows ID. Since the bellows wall thickness is always less than that of the adjoining duct, the transition piece must provide the proper thickness ratio for a | sound weld joint. "
What consequences can arise from allowing the doubler to contact the end convolution in a bellows assembly?,"Doublers are often used to build up weld-neck thickness for a more favorable ratio of bellows-to-duct weld thickness. However, if a doubler is permitted to touch the end convolution, the stress raiser thus created can promote early fatigue failure when the bellows is deflected or subjected to vibration. Also, the weld attachment is kept away from the end convolution, because (1) the flexural stress at the convolute root dissipates rapidly with distance from the convolute and (2) short necks make welding | difficult. "
What factors influence the design strength when assessing the load transmitted through a connection interface?,"| | The spring-rate loads of the bellows transmitted to the duct at the weld neck are factors in | neck design. Failure of the weld joint or the neck can occur if the stress applied at the bellows-to-duct interface exceeds the design strength. Although the geometry of the outside-neck attachment may have appeal, designs that require this configuration are evaluated carefully, because fabrication is difficult. "
What are the alternatives to the gimbal-ring joint in bellows restraint designs?,"The | outside-neck attachment always increases cost of manufacture and may downgrade the bellows performance, as certain convolute configurations may be inhibited. 2.2.2 Bellows Restraint | | | 2.2.2.1 MECHANICAL LINKAGES The most commonly used restraint design is the gimbal-ring joint (or universal); other | concepts include the hinged joint, ball joint, and braided sheath. Reference 16 (pp. 76-78) presents a broad spectrum of designs. "
What feature of the gimbal-ring joint allows it to handle torsional loads effectively?,"The gimbal-ring joint is the “workhorse” of bellows restraints. It can be designed to , | withstand extremely high pressures and temperatures, is capable of angular deflection in all | planes, and will withstand imposed torsional loads. Stops to prevent excessive bellows angulation are readily adaptable to this design. The load-carrying pivot pins may be designed | for either single or double-shear support, the choice depending on the separating load. "
What type of deflection occurs when a gimbal joint is deflected about both axes at the same time?,"The | same comments apply to the hinged joint, which provides angulation in one plane only. | A subtlety of gimballed bellows, sometimes overlooked even by experienced duct designers, is the fact that a gimbal (or universal) joint, when deflected about both of its axes simultaneously, produces a torsional deflection (refs. 105 and 106). Motion is not 65 {|S wi “ ia | ; transmitted with a constant angular-velocity ratio unless the intersection of driving and driven components lies in a homokinetic plane (ref. "
"What type of deflection is induced by gimbal-ring linkages due to their geometry, resulting in high stresses within a normally rigid component?","105). Gimbal-ring linkages do not have this type of geometry; therefore, they induce a torsional deflection. Because the bellows normally is very rigid in torsion, high torsional stresses are produced.. "
What type of material is commonly employed to provide external restraint for flexible hoses while accommodating deflections and damping vibrations?,"One of the most popular and inexpensive methods for an external, tension-tie restraint is the use of a braided wire sheath, as in the case of a flexible hose. This type of joint can absorb | both angular and shear deflections, and acts as a vibration damper for the bellows inside."
How does offcenter pivoting affect angular deflection and bending moments under high pressure conditions?,"| The braid restricts angular deflection under high pressure by offcenter pivoting, which results in increased bending moments."
"How can friction between components be reduced, and what lubricant is suggested for specific surfaces?","Friction between the braid and bellows can be minimized by an adapter, which provides | | clearance at the end convolutions, and by the application of solid dry-film lubricant on theouter surface of the bellows and inner surface of the braid. Excessive friction and eventually |possible galling of the journal-type pin bearings on the linkages is a problem that also can be"
What are the types of lubricants identified for compatibility with liquid oxygen?,alleviated with solid dry-film lubricants (refs. 107 and 108). LOX-compatible lubricants
What must be utilized to ensure compatibility with lubricants in certain cryogenic systems?,"must be used between bellows plies and on the bearings of restraint linkages utilized in LOXsystems. Data on LOX compatibility of lubricants are utilized in making a selection; if data |are not available, as on a new product, LOX impact tests are performed. Reference 107provides additional information on the use of lubricants for linkage bearings."
What are the key considerations a designer must evaluate when choosing between internal and external mounting for a gimbal-ring bellows restraint?,"| Once a gimbal-ring type of bellows restraint has been selected, the question of internal versus external mounting (fig. 24) must be resolved. In general, the selection of internal or external gimbal is left to the discretion of the designer after design tradeoff studies for his particular application have been made. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages. The internal gimbal is more difficult to clean, because all of the mechanisms comes in contact. "
What design type exhibits a greater loss coefficient in comparison to an alternative option when considering flow losses in rotating systems?,"| with the flowing fluid and therefore requires cleaning. Both gimbals can be “‘sleeved”’ to reduce flow losses; however, the conventional internal-gimbal-ring design has a higher loss coefficient than the external-ring, sleeved-bellows design."
What effect does a larger diameter bellows have on the separating load and linkage weight?,"If the diameter of an internal gimbal ring is equal to or greater than the duct inside diameter, a larger diameter bellows is required to encompass the linkage. The larger bellows | causes a greater separating load and consequently an increase in linkage weight to carry this load. A comparision of the weights of internal and external gimbal designs for a given | diameter and pressure cannot be generalized and must be evaluated for each individual design case. | The external-ring design affords some handling damage protection to the bellows, whereas. "
What factors determine the adaptability of a shear type joint in a gimbal linkage under varying load conditions?,"| the internal ring design leaves the bellows exposed. Double versus single shear in the clevis | pin of the gimbal linkage is a function of the load that the joint can carry, and either type is adaptable to both the internal and external gimbals. Experience on the Centaur stage has |"

A single-shear design was used for the propellant feedlines in the early Centaur development, but was abandoned in favor of the double-shear design. "
What type of design enhances the strength and reliability of joints compared to its single-shear counterpart?,"The double-shear design proved to be much stronger and improved the reliability of the joint. The mechanism of failure in a single-shear design is popping or stripping of the heads from the pins restraining the joint under load. In the F-1 engine, in ducts equipped with external-gimbal-ring bellows joints, the gimbal ring came in contact with the bellows’ outer diameter in an overdeflected condition and caused damage. "
What modification was made to the gimbals to address the issue of excessive bending during handling and installation?,"The ducts were small (1.5 in. diam.) and therefore easily overdeflected during | shipment, handling, and installation. Normally, protective covers are installed to prevent ; damage and overdeflection of the bellows joint, but in this instance the covers were not | installed. To solve the overdeflection problem, the gimbals were redesigned so that the ring would bottom out on the rigid tube structure of the duct instead of on the bellows. "
What are the primary disadvantages of using an internal-tie link joint in high-velocity fluid systems?,"| The internal-tie link joint is an economical version of the gimbal joint for small or medium | pressure-separating loads, and weighs less than the equivalent gimbal. It has the disadvantage of high loss factors due to the frontal-area restriction to flow. This joint is not suitable for | 67 use in systems with high-velocity fluids, but frequently is used in the low-pressure, turbine-gas duct systems of rocket engines. "
How does the variability of the pivot point in a chain-link joint affect the fatigue life of a system during angular deflection?,"Link joints also have low torsional strength. | A peculiarity of the chain-link joint (fig. 25) is that the pivot point of the linkage is not fixed but depends on the plane in which the joint is angulated. Since the angular deflection is evenly distributed over the live length of the bellows only when that length is centered about the pivot point, this change in pivot-point location with plane of angulation will reduce fatigue life. "

What was the percentage decrease in fatigue life observed during the flexural endurance tests related to chain links and bellows live length?,"It was found that the manufacturers’ tooling was not locating the chain link accurately on the center of the | bellows live length. The links of the chain were 0.625-in. in diameter, and the bellows live length was a relatively short 2.4 in.; consequently a slight shift in live length had a great effect on bellows deflection and fatigue life. Results of flexural endurance tests showed a 20-percent reduction in fatigue life (800 cycles vs. "
What is a common issue encountered with bellows restraints in relation to localized pressure reactions?,"a normal 1000 cycles) with a 0.100-in. | axial shift in pivot point. Internal linkages are a requirement for nuclear engines because external inkages act as heat sinks for radiation. The linkages are cooled by liquid-hydrogen propellant. | A common problem with bellows restraints, both gimbal and hinge types, is that the bellows } pressure separating load produces a reaction in highly localized areas of the duct. "
What effect can localized loads on a bolted flange have on the associated bolts and static seals?,"Loads | 68 | alee 0 See ee ee a Oar Se re, Sa OO Tr age a | | concentrated in a point on a member are distributed across the cross section of the member, | as described by a 30° to 45° half-angle. When the joint is adjacent to a flange, duct length is | insufficient to allow the concentrated loads to redistribute circumferentially into the walls of | the duct. Consequently, localized loads applied to the bolted flange can overload the bolts | in the load area or cause deflection in the flange, possibly allowing static-seal leakage. "
What is the inside diameter of the inlet line used for the F-1 LOX pump on the engine test stand?,"| The ball-bearing ball-joint restraint (fig. 26) was used in the inlet line to the F-1 LOX pump on the engine test stand. The line has an inside diameter of 16.75 in., and a proof pressure | of 400 psig. Because of the large pressure separating load, the duct overall length limitations | and gimbal angular-deflection requirements dictated that the bellows joint utilizing this restraint be located immediately upstream of the pump inlet flange. "
What design feature was implemented to ensure uniform loading on the pump flange and accommodate motion?,"An uneven, circumferential loading of the pump flange could not be tolerated structurally by the pump, and the ball joint offered a design capable of providing gimbal-type restraint and motion | while applying a uniform circumferential load to the pump flange.

What mechanism allows for axial deflection while acting as a pressure-separating-load restraint?,"30) can be considered as a form of a pressure-separating-load restraint mechanism (i.e., a thrust-compensating linkage). This type of bellows assembly allows for axial deflection in the same manner as an unrestrained bellows. | ee | .

What is the more accurate term for the type of joint commonly referred to as “pressure-volume-compensating” in relation to axial thrust compensation?,"| The term “‘pressure-volume-compensating” (PVC) duct has come into use in describing this type of joint. This terminology is misleading, however; no pressure compensation is | performed by the duct. A more nearly correct description is “thrust compensating,” because | it is the axial thrust caused by the pressure separating force that is balanced by the compensating bellows. It is axiomatic that, in order to compensate for thrust, the volume must also be compensated; so this portion of the PVC description is correct. "
What role does the compensating joint play in managing thrust forces within constrained spatial environments?,"The primary use of the compensating joint is to retain a tension-type system in areas where limited space } exists and axial travel cannot be absorbed by angulation. By proper selection of the | cross-sectional area of the balance bellows, the thrust force may be undercompensated, fully compensated, or overcompensated, so that a compressive, balancing, or tensile load is imposed on the installation restraints. "
What design concept was implemented in the ducts to mitigate detrimental pressure variations in the engine operation of the Saturn S-IC vehicle?,"The large (+ 50%) volumetric changes incurred in straight-run gimballing ducts correspondingly incur pressure perturbations that could be detrimental to engine operation. | The thrust-compensating design eliminates these pressure variations. This design concept was 2 | ""2 | | | | ) | ‘Sie a: =a ‘ ow Zz e] | used in all the ducts to the pump inlets of the five F-1 engines of the Saturn S-IC vehicle. "
What purpose does the PVC design serve in relation to system volume consistency during engine movement?,"As the engines respond to thrust vector control, these ducts are required to have an axial stroke | of as much as + 50 percent of the live length of the compensator bellows. Without the PVC feature, the volume change of the system could cause corresponding pressure pulses and variable loading on the pump inlets. Consistent engine performance depends on uniform supply of propellants to the pumps. The PVC design maintains a constant system volume | | under all engine gimballing conditions. "
What component is used to balance the separating force in the pump inlet duct assembly?,"| In the F-1 pump inlet duct, a bellows external to and concentric with the main line bellows ! offsets the separating force of the main bellows (fig. 31, a schematic of the joint shown in fig. 30). The annular chamber is vented to internal duct pressure, and axial-tension rods tie | across the bellows, as indicated, alternately around the circumference. Telescoping flow sleeves can also be provided. "
What feature of the described design minimizes pressure loss compared to a standard rigid line?,This design permits wide-open flow area throughout its length | and thereby adds very little additional pressure loss over a straight hard line. The thrust-compensating design shown in figure 32 utilizes axial bellows of the same cross-sectional area; operating pressure is applied to the outside surfaces of both bellows. The internal volume of the bellows second from the left in the figure is vented to ) atmosphere. 
What type of configuration allows the use of axial bellows with a lower spring rate due to an increase in critical buckling pressure?,"The outer shell over both center bellows acts as the linkage that restrains the forces separating the two. Flow direction is indicated by arrows. The joints on either end of the duct are of the internally tied, angulating type and complete the utility of the duct assembly. This externally pressurized configuration permits the use of axial bellows with lower spring rate than can be used with pressure applied internally to bellows, because the critical buckling pressure of a given bellows design is higher with external pressure than with internal. "
What mechanism prevents axial separation in the design that uses overlapping fingers tied across the joint?,"| The ‘finger compensator” design shown in figure 33 features a thrust-compensating chamber installed external to and concentric with the main duct bellows. The chamber is vented to internal duct pressure and, since the annular area AA is equal to the main duct | bellows area A,, an axial force equal and opposite to the pressure-separating force of the main duct bellows is created. The entire joint is prevented from separating axially by the overlapping fingers alternately tying across the joint from each free end. "
What design feature allows for both axial and angular movement while maintaining compactness in a specific engine component?,"Sufficient clearance | is provided between fingers to permit the required axial and angular motion. This design | provides compactness, because the bellows overlap concentrically and in addition are not limited to axial stroke alone. The design in figure 33 was used in the pump-discharge ducts of the early J-2 engines. In | later engines, the design was changed to the external-tie-bar design shown in figure 34, not because of performance problems but because of lower cost. "

What is the role of free bellows in a compression system within duct operations?,"| | Wis) | | | | 2.2.2.3 COMPRESSION SYSTEM | A compression system is one in which free bellows, without tension-tie linkages, are used to absorb the operational deflections in a duct system. The pressure separating and spring-rate forces of the bellows then must be reacted by the mating attachment structure of the engine : or airframe; this reaction places the ducting in compression. In ducting systems with compression-restrained bellows (e.g., low-pressure systems), the engine or vehicle support structure can be overloaded with moments (shear deflections in bellows) caused by eccentric pressure separating loads from the bellows. "
How can the installation of bellows be adjusted to minimize operational stress during their operation?,"This problem can be minimized by aligning the thrust vector of the bellows with the reaction points of the attaching structure. If the operational deflections of the bellows are predictable and repeatable, the bellows can be installed in an opposite deflection position such that it moves toward a neutral (and lower stress) position while in operation. This type of installation is | shown in figure 35. "

"What techniques are essential for effectively joining thin, often laminated, bellows to more substantial components?","— Typical bellows-to-duct attachments. 77 | 2.2.3 Bellows-to-Duct Attachment | The present practice of joining bellows, which are made of thin, sometimes laminated, and often dissimilar materials, to adjacent, more massive parts requires careful manufacturing techniques. Weld fixturing for proper fitup, use of chill blocks, and automatic welding where possible — all must be carefully planned, designed, and applied. "
What joining techniques are beneficial for connecting dissimilar metals while preserving heat-treat properties in bellows and ducts?,Electron-beam | welding and diffusion bonding offer advantages for joining dissimilar metals and widely different wall thicknesses and in addition minimize the effect on heat-treat properties because of confined heat input. Heat-treatable-alloy bellows are welded to non-heat-treatable-alloy ducts without disturbing the heat treat condition in the bellows | material. This attachment is accomplished by welding a transition section of the duct alloy | to the bellows before heat treating so that the final weld to the duct involves identical | alloys. 
What are the two types of attachments used for connecting bellows to ducts based on pressure and wall thickness?,"Typical bellows-to-duct attachments are shown in figure 36. | The bellows-to-duct attachment welds for the SSME are basically of two types: one for | low-pressure, relatively-thin-wall bellows, and the other for high-pressure, | relatively-thick-wall parts (fig. 37). The necks of the thin-wall bellows are resistance welded , together, then trimmed around the circumference through the center of the nugget. "

The bellows is then electron-beam welded to end rings, and the resultant assembly is heat treated. This subassembly technique allows the structurally important bellows neck weld to be brought up to heat-treat strength whereas, because of the fabrication sequence, the weld cannot always be heat treated when it is welded directly into a final assembly. "
What are the benefits of using butt-welded connections compared to traditional welded junctions in minimizing stresses due to thermal shock and radial pressure?,"| The welded junctions of bellows to ducts (usually thicker walled than the bellows) can | result in high discontinuity stresses. Butt-welded connections, which are as thick as the | bellows wall at the weld and gradually taper to the tube thickness, appreciably reduce | stresses resulting from thermal shock. This type of welded connection also reduces discontinuity stresses resulting from radial pressure. "
What factors contributed to the fatigue failures in the weld joint of the H-1 turbine exhaust structure?,The H-1 turbine exhaust cobra-head | hood (fig. 38(a)) is an example of fatigue failure in a weld joint that resulted from thermal cycling with mechanical vibration superposed. Fatigue cracks and eventual leakage | | repeatedly occurred with the sandwich-joint design used (fig. 38(b)). Thermal and stress analyses of the design indicated that high cyclic thermal stresses at engine start and cutoff due to the large temperature gradient across the laminated structure were causing the failures. 
What specific design feature was emphasized to minimize the thermal gradient in a high-heat-flux area in the tested engine component?,"The butt-welded forged Y-ring design (fig. 38(c)), in which laminations of material in a high-heat-flux region are eliminated (to reduce the thermal gradient) and all welds are | Class I, proved to be the design solution, as demonstrated by successful test evaluation; | however, the H-1 engine was phased out, and the new design was not accepted for retrofit of | existing engines (ref. 110). | De AREA OF ATTACHMENT | uu} | -— Sandwich requires close fitup Nn a CLASS 1} WELD | oe hs | MM EXHAUST GAS FLOW Tees eis Ss | (a) OVERALL VIEW OF BELLOWS-TO-DUCT CONFIGURATION (b) DETAIL OF SANDWICH JOINT DESIGN SUBJECT TO THERMAL FATIGUE as Y-RING | ALL CLASS | WELDS q | (c) DETAIL OF BUTT-WELDED FORGED Y-RING DESIGN NOT SUBJECT TO FATIGUE Figure 38. "
What is the most cost-effective and fastest method for joining thin-wall components in turbine exhaust systems?,"— Design change to preclude fatigue failure of bellows-to-duct attachments on H-1 turbine exhaust. | 79 | Resistance seam welding is the least expensive and quickest way to join thin-wall bellows to thin-wall ducts (< 0.090-in. wall). This method of joining does present some problems, however. During the circumferential seam welding operation, the clearance between the mating parts is gathered into a single large gap as the roller electrodes approach the 360° closeoff point (fig. "
What occurs if the distance between electrodes is too large during the welding process in thin-wall joints?,"39). If this gap is excessive, the electrodes will not be able to force the two parts together for an adequate weld. | /— ELECTRODE (TYR) f | es | : iH | as / | Gee seu | / DUCT WALL | VIEW A-A | GAP FROM ak 4 POOR FITUP | ( (a) CIRCUMFERENTIAL GATHERING OF (b) CROSS-SECTIONAL VIEW OF SEAM j | SEAM WELD WELD JOINT | | Figure 39. — Fitup problem with resistance seam welding of thin-wall ducts. | | Close fitup (i.e., careful sizing of the parts to be joined) and intermittent resistance spot | welding around the circumference of overlapping parts prior to welding constitute a fundamental requirement for a structurally acceptable joint. "
What are the challenges associated with interpreting radiography in evaluating lap resistance welds?,"Lap resistance welds also have the disadvantage that there is no conclusive nondestructive test method for proving their | adequacy. Radiography can be used, but the film is difficult to interpret because of the | | built-in cracks adjacent to each side of the weld nugget. | Fusion butt welds or burndown welds are preferable to resistance welds, but require very | accurate jigging and tooling to align the butting edges. "
What type of welding joint is typically loaded in tension rather than shear and can be inspected using radiographic methods?,"Butt welds can be inspected radiographically, and they are structurally superior to resistance welds, since the weld is loaded in tension, not in shear as in the resistance type. A method of joining bellows to ducting, not preferred but sometimes unavoidable, is the induction-brazing technique; this method is useful when the joint is inaccessible for the | usual welding process. | 80 | | | | | | | | . "
What are the purposes of internal liners in bellows regarding fatigue failures and pressure loss in engineering applications?,"rae | 2.2.4 Flow Liners Internal liners (sleeves) for bellows have been successful practical solutions to the problem of bellows fatigue failures brought about by flow-induced vibration. Liners also are used to effectively reduce the pressure loss of a bellows joint. They have been used as structural members supporting tube coils in the J-2 and J-2S engine heat exchangers. The liners themselves are not without problems, however. "
What design considerations are essential to prevent bottoming out or binding in flow-liners with bellows at maximum excursion?,"Liners must be designed such that, with the bellows at the maximum limits of excursion, they will not bottom out or bind on the | bellows or ducting; and they also should be designed with drain holes located as near as possible to the weld attachment to provide for removal of cleaning fluids and contaminants. | Typical flow-liner configurations are shown in figure 40.

What modifications can be made to enhance the durability of components subject to vibration-induced failures?,"— Typical flow-liner configurations. | | | | | 81 | | | : | Fatigue failures of liners in which cracks appeared in the trailing edge and in the weld joint have occurred. These failures were attributed to vibration modes of the cantilevered end of the sleeve. Increasing the wall thickness, which thereby increased the rigidity of the liner until it successfully withstood the vibration inputs, solved this problem. "
"What phenomenon occurs when external pressure on a liner surpasses internal pressure, particularly due to sudden flowrate fluctuations?",", Collapse of liners as a result of pressure on the outer diameter of the liner exceeding that on the inner diameter also has occurred (ref. 111). Collapse has been attributed to sudden changes in flowrate that cause a differential static pressure across the liner wall. Since liner diameter usually is smaller than the attaching duct diameter (fig. 40), the liner section | behaves like a venturi, and rapid changes in flowrate cause static pressure changes in the | liner section. "
What measures can be implemented to prevent collapse of a liner due to pressure differentials during fill and drain operations?,"If the static pressures on either side of the liner do not stabilize quickly, a | momentary differential can be induced on the liner wall and cause collapse. In the case of fill and drain lines, the stagnation pressure in the drain flow direction (against the OD of the | liner) adds to the difference in static pressures and can cause liner collapse (ref. 111). Vent | holes in the liner can relieve some of this pressure differential, or the liner can be | strengthened to withstand the applied load. "
What material was used for the braided metal hose in the original Atlas booster engine design?,"| 2.3 FLEXIBLE HOSE | The industrial experience in braided flexible hose provided a starting point for advancing the | technology to the state required for space-vehicle applications. However, as in the case of | bellows joints, pressure ratings in the sizes needed were unheard of. The procurement of | | commercial braided metal hose of 3- and 3'%4-in. diameter made of 321 CRES for 750 psi operational pressure in the original Atlas booster engine design is an example. "
What modifications were made to the hose design to comply with specific aerospace standards for engine testing?,"This pressure | level was greatly in excess of the commercial rating and left little or no margin of safety. These hoses, however, were used for initial engine tests, and pressure ratings eventually were | increased by modifying the design to meet aerospace requirements. Thousands of hoses in | this size (3 to 3% in.) have been used for both cryogenic-oxidizer and hydrocarbon-fuel applications in the Navaho, Atlas, Jupiter, and Thor engines, a very large population for space-vehicle hardware. "
What was the common design used for flexible hoses in rocket engine operations prior to the development of coiled tubing?,"Little was known about the pressure losses in hoses at the Reynolds number used in rocket | engine operation (Re > 10°). Fatigue life and cryogenic-temperature properties of the materials available were sketchy. These voids eventually were filled to permit successful operational designs. Coiled tubing, an alternate design for small-diameter bellows-type flexible hoses, is not used on any engines of the Saturn or earlier programs. "
What is the main purpose of utilizing coiled tubing in certain heat exchangers used by rocket engine manufacturers?,"However, rocket engine manufacturers do use coiled tubing consistently in tank-pressurization heat exchangers. The primary purpose is not to achieve line flexibility, a secondary benefit, but to provide the maximum | heat-transfer surface area possible in a minimum of space. | | | | | 82 | In the Centaur stage, a coiled tube is used for the pneumatic lines to the main engines; also,.

For two of the three flexible sections, the longitudinal centerlines are located in the gimbal plane. The center of the live length of each of these two flexible sections is located on each of the gimbal axes. A third flexible section is located in the vertical leg to provide universal motion of one end of the line with respect to the other. "
What technique is employed to reduce bending stresses in flexible sections during motion limitation?,"This method of locating the flexible sections limits their motions to the gimbal angle only, thereby minimizing bending stresses | | and attendant fatigue. When the hoses are not inherently stiff enough to resist motions imparted by mechanical vibration or undesirable displacements due to acceleration loads, then clamps and support brackets, strategically located, are used as dampers. Other configurations have been used for crossing the gimbal plane when lack of available | installation space prevented the wraparound approach. "

What is the pressure drop ratio between a convoluted innercore and a comparable-diameter hard tube during flow?,f = © Figure 42. — Off-center hose configuration crossing gimbal plane | used in engine-to-vehicle lines of J-2 engine. | 84 | | A considerable amount of test data has been accumulated on the flow losses through flexible metal hoses (refs. 119 through 125); these data are used in the design phase of a new application.

What are the implications of using bent flexible-hose elements on pressure loss and fatigue life?,"Bends in flexible-hose elements are avoided where possible. The references show that, for comparable geometries, the ratio of the pressure-loss factor for a convoluted elbow to the pressure-loss factor for straight convoluted section is much greater than the ratio of pressure-loss factor for plain-tube elbow to the pressure-loss factor for a straight tube. In addition to the pressure-drop disadvantages, the bent flexible configuration maintains a steady-state deflection stress on the part in an installed position; | this stress can adversely influence fatigue life. "
What is the maximum Mach number recommended for gas velocities in flexible hose designs to prevent pressure loss and flow-induced vibrations?,| 2.3.2 Sizing Current practices in sizing flexible hose involve the same general considerations used for sizing lines (sec. 2.1.2). A practice on most flexible-hose designs is to keep velocities of gases | below a Mach number of 0.3 in order to avoid pressure loss and flow-induced vibration. This approach is not supported by either analytical results or experimental data. Analyses of pressure loss (refs. 
What design approach do manufacturers use to manage pressure losses in flexible metal hoses?,119 through 125) and flow-induced vibration (refs. 84 through 90) are better methods for avoiding problems with either phenomenon. | Standard design practice for manufacturers of flexible metal hose is to make the innercore inside diameter greater than the attaching-tube inside diameter. This procedure introduces | expansion and contraction losses that must be traded off with hose pressure losses for an acceptable total loss. 
What factors related to pressure capability and resistance are considered when analyzing the flexible-hose innercore for vibrations?,"2.3.3 Innercore | Analysis of flexible-hose innercore for flow-induced and mechanically induced vibration is the same as for bellows (sec. 2.2.1.2), with the exception that the braid restrains the convolutions to vibrate individually. Other considerations such as pressure capability, : corrosion resistance, manufacturing practices, and handling protection for flexible hoses are | similar to those for bellows (secs. "
What factors can lead to the failure of a nonmetal hose in a propulsion system?,"2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.4, 2.2.1.5, and 2.1 5.7} | 2.3.3.1 OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY Temperature extremes to which components are subjected in a rocket engine system usually | | will exempt a nonmetal hose from consideration. Even if the hose is suitable for conveying a particular fluid, then proximity to hot or cold running components, placement in view of | the exhaust plume, exposure to exhaust blowback, a test-stand fire, or exposure to cryogenic temperature could cause failure of a nonmetal hose. "
What phenomenon occurs in braided innercores that causes a compressive load and prevents constant radius bending?,"These adversities seldom pose | | problems with metal hoses. | | 85 | | ! | | | | ee . | | Annularly convoluted metal innercore is the predominant type of pressure-carrying member | in aerospace flexible hoses. The methods of stress analysis for bellows are applicable for braided-hose innercore; however, it cannot be assumed that the total live length will be active in bending. The “Chinese-finger-trick” effect of the braid, which causes a compressive load on the innercore OD, plus the bottoming out of the braid wires in bending, do not | permit a smooth arc (constant radius) deflection of the innercore. "
What challenges are associated with the end-fitting attachment of a helical metal innercore in specific applications?,"Helically convoluted metal innercore, although more readily available and less expensive | than the annular type, is not generally used in aerospace applications. The scarfed end of the innercore presents a difficult joint at the end-fitting attachment. Puddles of braze or weld | are required, with resultant poor control of quality. Torsional deflection imposed on the | hose during assembly creates a preload that tends to loosen end fittings if they are flared-tube threaded connections. "
What is the relationship between pressurization and twisting effects in flexible hoses?,"This same twisting effect is created when the line is pressurized. | Although some flexible-hose users insist that seamless tubing be used, no evidence has been | found in J-2, F-1, H-1, Atlas, or Thor programs to indicate that this practice is necessary. Seamless tubing is much more expensive than rolled and welded tubes, and since bellows are | rarely made from standard tubes, the lead time for special mill runs can be excessive. "
What fabrication method results in better uniformity of wall thickness compared to seamless tubing due to inherent eccentricities during tube forming?,"Rolled and welded tubes, fabricated properly with good fitup and welding, have proved to be very successful. The welds are X-rayed for quality verification and put through a torturous ordeal in the bellows forming process. If no leaks occur after forming, the assurance of high reliability is excellent. Also, the uniformity of wall thickness for rolled and welded sheet is | better than that achieved with seamless tubing because of ID/OD eccentricities inherent in tube forming. "
"What issues were experienced with tubular Teflon in rocket engines, particularly related to its structural integrity?","| Nonmetal innercore such as rubber or tubular or annularly convoluted Teflon has not been | | used extensively in rocket engine systems. Atlas, Thor, and F-1 engine experience with | tubular Teflon included problems of kinking, cracking, leaking, and burning (pin holes). Kinking, the most prevalent problem in Teflon hoses, results in increased differential | | pressure and possible fracture of the innercore. "
What issues can arise from the improper curing of a Teflon liner in relation to its structural integrity?,"Kinking problems have been resolved by the addition of an internal helical spring throughout the hose ID, mechanically attached to the end fittings. Another solution is convoluting of the innercore; however, the convoluted | Teflon type has limited pressure-carrying capability. Cracking because of embrittlement of the Teflon has occurred. Curing of the Teflon liner is critical, because if incorrectly accomplished, the liner is subject to longitudinal and radial cracking. "
What is essential for maintaining an effective seal in swaged end fittings on nonmetal hoses?,"Leakage of swaged end fittings used on all nonmetal hoses is a problem because of inherent } | design weaknesses. The mechanical seal arrangement in swaged fittings is dependent on initial | | | | 86 ) | | | | | | | | application of pressure during fabrication to seal properly. Torquing of this joint is critical, and if the torque is lessened either accidentally or during disassembly, the joint will leak. "
What material is used in the innercore to prevent static charge accumulation in Teflon hoses?,"Pinhole burning, presumably caused by electrostatic discharge from the liner to the braid, | has occurred with Teflon liners. This problem supposedly has been solved by impregnating | the innercore with carbon, thus making it conductive and presumably preventing accumulation of static charge. ! Despite all these problems, Teflon has been used successfully in some applications. The | Titan Ill engines use both normal (white) and carbon-impregnated Teflon flex hoses in sizes ranging from 3/8 in. "
What operating pressure was successfully used with Teflon hose on the S-IC stage of the Saturn vehicle?,"to 1 in. in diameter. About half of these are carbon impregnated; changes to the carbon type have been made only for new designs, since it has never been | conclusively proved that carbon impregnation is the solution to the problems of pinhole | burning caused by electrostatic discharge. On the S-IC stage of the Saturn vehicle, Teflon hose was used successfully with RP-1 at 2200 | psi operating pressure. "
What factors influence the bending moment necessary for shaping a flexible hose in an airborne hydraulic system?,"Teflon innercore has been used successfully for the airborne | hydraulic system on Centaur. | Rubber hose is limited to noncryogenic or non-high-temperature applications. Rubber is subject to age problems because its quality deteriorates with time. It also will swell when | subjected to trichloroethylene flushing; the swelling restricts flow and can cause failure of | the end-fitting joint. i 2.3.3.2 BENDING MOMENT The bending moment required to bend a flexible hose is a consideration because of the , loading applied to adjacent components. "
How does axial compression of the innercore affect the number of convolutions and bending stiffness in flexible hoses?,"For example, reduction of bending moments of flexible hoses that cross the engine gimbal plane reduces the actuator loading required to | gimbal the engine. Lubricants applied to braid wires and the outer surfaces of the innercore reduce bending moments. Compressing the innercore axially before installing the braid results in more convolutions per inch and a lower bending stiffness, at the expense of | increased weight and material cost. "
What role does the braid play in the performance of a flexible hose regarding buckling stability when under pressure?,"Innercore compression also improves the ability of the hose to withstand pressure impulses. | 2.3.3.3 BUCKLING STABILITY | Buckling stability, which is of concern in the design of a bellows, is not a source of concern | in the design of a flexible hose. The support that the braid provides for the innercore prevents buckling unless end attachments (on installation) prevent the braid from pulling | taut when the hose is pressurized. "
What material is predominantly used for the woven covering of hoses in propulsion systems to provide support and protection?,"87 | | | | | | | | a sete | 2.3.4 Braid The braid consists of a woven tubular covering that restrains the innercore against elongation while giving it lateral support and protection. Since the braid absorbs the entire | separating load, its strength largely governs the burst pressure* of a hose; stiffness and yield strength govern the length or stretch. The braid covering on the majority of hoses used in | rocket propulsion systems is woven of stainless-steel wire. "
What technique is employed to attach the braided section to the end fittings after applying a tensile load?,"Tubular braid may be woven directly on the innercore. For bellows-type innercores, however, the braid generally is woven in continuous lengths or sheaths that are cut as required and slipped over the bellows | | during assembly. Sections of braid are cut at a length slightly greater than that of the convoluted innercore. A tensile load then is applied to the ends of the braid section, and the | section is attached to the end fittings by brazing or welding. "
What is the consequence of wires within a braid bottoming out during angulation in terms of stress and fatigue life?,"The braid-weave pattern must be such that the wires will not bind or bottom out within the | angular-deflection design limits of a particular flexible section. If the wires within a braid bottom out against each other when the hose is angulated, further deflection will be | distributed over a shorter live-length section, the result being higher stresses and shorter fatigue life. Tubular wire braid is available in a variety of constructions. "
"What types of wire forms are mentioned, and what is a significant distinction between the “beamed” type and the alternative type discussed?","In addition to variations in numbers and diameters of wires, there are variations in the form or grouping of the wires, the weave, the braid angle, and the number of braid layers. The most commonly used form of wire is the “beamed” type in which each carrier bobbin of the braiding machine is wound | with a group of parallel wires called a “pick,” or an “end,” or a “carrier.” In another type, each pick consists of a number of wires that have been first braided into a flat braid before being wound on the bobbin. "
What two types of weaving patterns are commonly utilized in the manufacturing process?,"The size and number of wires per carrier are selected to obtain | flexibility and strength within the machine capabilities. | Two weaves are commonly used: plain weave, two-over/two-under; and diamond weave, | one-over/one-under. The term “basket weave” is loosely applied to any tubular braid. Plain | weave permits the greater number of wires and therefore the greater coverage. (Coverage is . critical in electrical shielding applications, but is of secondary importance in metal hose as | long as the mesh remains tight enough to retain the innercore.) Large braids are limited to | plain weave. "
What is the presumed angle that provides optimal flexibility along with strength and resistance for hoses containing a metal inner core?,"Diamond weave is the tighter construction. The cost of either weave is about | the same. Typical braid configurations are shown in figure 43. ) | The braid angle or helix angle is the angle whose tangent is the pitch divided by the braid circumferential length per pitch, the pitch being the axial distance taken by any given wire | | to make one complete turn. An angle of approximately 45° is presumed to give maximum flexibility consistent with good end strength and burst resistance for hose with metal | innercore. "

What is the minimum degree traverse required along the length of a hose to ensure efficient wire usage?,"ee Ke BE For most efficient use of braid, the wires should make a traverse of at least 360° along the length of the hose. Less of a traverse results in high bending loads and excessive bending of individual wires at the attach points, thus causing fatigue failure. Sufficient wire | cross-sectional area, plus a suitable margin, is supplied to resist the pressure separating load of the bellows. | Multiple layers of braid may be used to achieve greater strength within wire-handling capacity of the braider and without too great a sacrifice in flexibility. "
What is the efficiency percentage assumed for the second layer of a braid in achieving load distribution?,"Because of the | difficulty in obtaining perfect load distribution between layers of braid, it is reasonable to assume that the second layer is only 80-percent efficient. | | Tubular braid is readily available in a variety of metals and sizes up to 18 in. in diameter. The tensile strength of stainless-steel braid wire is about 120 000 psi, although high-tensile | (up to 270 000 psi) braid is obtainable. "
"How is the final strength of a braid determined based on the total wire count, individual wire strength, and braid efficiency?","Tubular braid is identified or described as follows: ID X number of wires per carrier X number of carriers X diameter of wire X kind of | material. | The end strength of a braid may be calculated from the relation F, = 0 #, By sind (2) | where | | F, = braid end strength, lbf | | n = total number of wires in braid | F, = strength of a single braid wire, lbf | B, = braid efficiency (a factor providing for stress intensification in the braid and in | the braid attachment) | = 0.93 for annealed wire | : | = 0.85 for hard-drawn wire = 0.80 for a second layer , | | & = braid angle as defined previously (fig.

What formula is used to determine the approximate increase in length of a metal braided hose when subjected to pressure?,"43), deg | | | 90 | | | | | | The burst pressure (as limited by braid end strength) of a bellows-type metal braided hose | may be found from the expression F, | Pp al Ate (3) | where P, = burst pressure, psi | | Ace = effective area of bellows, in.? 8) Dee | | zi m _ OD+ID | aoage where D,, ey | | The restraining force contributed by the bellows is practically negligible.

What materials are used for braided hoses in the SSME due to corrosion issues with 300-series CRES braid?,"Braid wire is subject to corrosion; reference 128 presents a summary of a corrosion incident. Because of the experience with corrosion of 300-series-CRES braid materials and the | | | 91 | | exceptionally long life requirement of the SSME (100 missions), all SSME braided hoses are made of nickel-base alloys. } 2.3.5 End Construction | Two types of end construction (i.e., juncture of innercore, tube adapter, and braid), evolved ) after many years of experience, were used extensively on the J-2 and F-1 engines and on the S-II stage. "
"What type of construction is necessary for high-temperature applications, and what is the maximum diameter of lines that these designs can accommodate?","These constructions are (1) a welded and brazed design for use at temperatures | | less than 400°F (fig. 44(a)), and (2) an all-welded design for high-temperature (> 400° F) applications (fig. 44(b)); welded construction is required for high-temperature applications | because of the loss of strength of the braze material. These designs have been used successfully for lines up to 3 in. in diameter. "
What type of welding is utilized for attaching the pressure-carrier neck to the tube adapter in large-diameter hoses for specific feed systems?,: | A construction different from those described above is used on large-diameter (3%4- and 4-in. ID) hoses developed for the Atlas and Thor gimballing feed systems. The tube ID is large enough to permit a lap weld of the pressure-carrier neck to the tube adapter (fig. 44(c)). | This design is different from the brazed design used in the previously mentioned smaller sizes because it was developed in working with different suppliers. 
What methods have been utilized effectively for end constructions in rocket engine and vehicle applications?,"It is believed that the ! | designs for the smaller sizes can be extrapolated to larger diameters; however, there has been no practical experience with the larger diameters. | | Many other end constructions have been used successfully in rocket engine and vehicle applications.

"
What factors influence the moments necessary to bend braided metallic hoses according to their geometry and construction?,"| | 2.3.6 Bending Moment | The moments required to deflect braided metal hoses are a function of hose geometry and | construction (e.g., diameter, innercore thickness, number of plies, live length, number of layers of braid, number of wires and diameters) and operating pressure.

What is the primary purpose of a filter in a fluid system?,"— Typical bending moments for various configurations of braided metal hose. | | | 2.4 FILTERS The function of a filter in a fluid system is to reduce the amount of contamination in the | system to a level at which the remaining particles do not affect the performance | | | 94 characteristics of contamination-sensitive components. The filter must be of a size capable of removing the necessary amount of system-generated, built-in, or environmental contamination throughout the required service life without excessive increase in differential pressure across the filter element (refs. "
What are the two types of mechanical filter elements used for removing contamination from a fluid system?,129 and 130). Typical filter applications are summarized in table II. | 2.4.1 Filter Element Mechanical filter elements remove contamination from a fluid system by physically trapping the particles as they pass through the filter material. The filter element can be either a surface or a depth type. A surface filter performs its function by trapping particulate contamination on the upstream side of the filter surface at the inlets of the filter material | capillaries. 
How do the dimensions of a particle influence its removal efficiency by a depth filter compared to that of a spherical particle?,"A depth filter performs its function by trapping particulate contamination within the intricate capillary system of the filter material; it has the ability to remove particles with | one dimension significantly greater than either of the other two dimensions (e.g., fibers). The significance of longest or largest dimension for the particle as compared with the diameter of a spherical particle is emphasized in reference 131. "
What are the primary advantages of using surface filters in rocket systems regarding particle size control and cleaning efficiency?,"In rocket systems, most | surface filters have been woven wire cloth and most depth filters have been stacked etched | metal disks. Reference 12 contains excellent descriptions of various types of filters and filter | materials. | Surface filters have the following characteristics: @ Good control of maximum particle size | @ Easy to clean | © Thin cross section (necessary for design of maximum area configurations) | e Free from filter- material (media) migration and release of initial element | contamination. "
"What are the primary characteristics of depth filters compared to surface filters in terms of lifespan, weight, and particle size management?","| Depth filters have the following characteristics: | @ Longer life than surface type for equal area @ Thicker cross-sectional area than surface type, hence greater weight for equal area @ Generally poor control of maximum particle size, because of nonuniform pore 1 | size @ More efficient removal of fine particles for equal large-particle control | : 95 | | | | @ Tend to erode ® Prone to filter-material (media) migration and release of initial element contamination. "
What key characteristics of contaminants must be identified to select the most suitable filter design for an application?,"The majority of filters in use are of the surface type, primarily because they provide maximum surface area for minimum weight. Selection of the optimum filter design for a | given application requires a definition of the following parameters: | (1) Largest particle size that can be tolerated by the operating components (2) Amount and type of contaminant that will be encountered during service life, | including all cleaning and test fluids (3) Maximum pressure drop that can be allocated by the system (4) Space that can be made available within the system | Of these four basic variables, the first can be defined with a fair degree of accuracy, since the allowable particle size can be determined by a review of the clearances or the sizes of capillaries in a contamination-sensitive component. "
What must be considered regarding component malfunction severity related to particles on critical surfaces?,"A review of system-performance . requirements reveals the degree of severity of possible component malfunction due to the | entrapment of a particle on a valve seal or other critical surface. The second variable, | however, is more difficult to define because of the following factors: | ¢ The amount of contamination remaining after component cleaning and system flushing can be calculated only to an approximate minimum value. "
What factors must be analyzed to determine the optimal installation method for a filter within a system?,"@ The amount of contamination that is environmentally introduced during service and assembly is almost impossible to predict. ® During laboratory tests, the fluids and temperatures used for evaluation often | vary considerably from those encountered by the filter in service. | The third and fourth variables can be defined by performing a systems analysis and by making a trade study to determine whether it is more advantageous to have the filter externally mounted or to have it installed as an integral part of the component. "
What does the maximum particle size rating regulate regarding particulate contaminants allowed after filtration?,"2.4.1.1 FILTER RATING The filter rating is intended to specify the largest particle that can pass through the filter; , the rating thus determines the degree of protection for downstream components. Several | | | 96 | | | : different ratings are used in the filter industry; some tend to be misleading if not fully understood by the user. The most definitive of the various ratings is the maximum particle size rating (MPR), which controls the maximum (longest) dimension of any particulate contaminant allowed downstream of a filter. "
What is the difference between absolute and nominal ratings in filtration concerning particle retention and size specifications?,Other filter ratings commonly used are “absolute” and “nominal”. The absolute rating applied to a filter unit requires the unit to retain all spherical particles equal to or greater in size than the absolute rating. This rating controls only the second largest dimension of contaminant allowed downstream of the | filter. The absolute rating is often referred to as the glass bead rating (GBR). The nominal rating applied to a filter unit requires that the unit retain a certain percentage (by count or | by weight) of spherical particles or graded dust equal to or greater in size than the nominal rating. 
What type of test determines the maximum size specification of particles in filtration systems using identifiable contaminants?,"The nominal rating is always less than the absolute rating. The nominal rating is less well defined than absolute rating, and it is a relative indication of filter capability only. The use of nominal rating in the filter industry is becoming obsolete because of the ambiguity of | | its definition. | | The maximum particle size rating can be determined by test. The test involves the use of a | | readily identifiable contaminant that contains particles of various sizes and shapes. "
What method is used to evaluate the largest particle size captured by a membrane filter after filtration of a specified artificial contaminant?,A test | procedure for determining maximum particle size is described in reference 132. | The absolute rating (GBR) of a filter also can be determined by test. Tests are based on | | filtration of an artificial contaminant (glass beads) under specified test conditions. Effluent containing artificial contaminant that has passed through the test filter is collected. The | artificial contaminant is passed through a membrane filter and the particles held on the | membrane are scanned for the largest particle (ref. 
What method is used to determine the average pore size of filter cloth but is not widely utilized due to mercury toxicity?,"133). Since approximately 60 percent of the beads required for testing a 15-u filter fall in the 25-u range or smaller, they tend to | coagulate on the membrane and obscure beads that are larger. The test procedure most | often utilized is well defined in reference 133, but provisions for preventing coagulation are | lacking. A means of determining nominal (average) pore size is the mercury intrusion method, which is not in general use because of the toxicity of the mercury and is applicable only to filter cloth in the flat state. "
What two types of wire cloth are mentioned in relation to the correlation between maximum particle size rating and absolute rating?,"A detailed explanation of the mercury intrusion test is presented in | reference 12 (sec. 15.8.5.2). Although the use of absolute rating (GBR) is more prevalent, the maximum particle size rating (MPR) is a truer indication of the protection afforded to downstream components. A correlation between MPR and GBR has been established for both twilled double Dutch weave (TDDW) and plain Dutch single weave (PDSW) wire cloth (ref. "
What is the relationship between the maximum particle size rating and the absolute rating in terms of size comparison?,"132), viz., the maximum particle size rating (MPR) is approximately 2.5 times the absolute (GBR) rating. As an example, a filter element using TDDW wire cloth having an absolute rating of 10p will | permit the passage of particles up to 25u into the downstream system. The correlation between MPR and GBR for other types of filter elements (e.g., etched disk) needs to be | established by test for each particular type. "
What type of test is correlated with a nondestructive method to verify absolute ratings for manufacturing filters?,"Reference 132 lists the correlation factors for a limited number of filter materials and kinds of construction. a7 | | | Maximum-particle-size tests are not practical for acceptance testing of production filters. | The glass bead test is a destructive type of test and is never used as an acceptance test; however, correlation with a nondestructive bubble-point test permits verification of absolute rating for production filters. "
What effect does pore size have on the pressure needed to initiate bubble formation in a wetted filter during testing?,"The bubble-point test consists of wetting the filter with a liquid of known surface tension and then determining the gas pressure required to force a bubble through the wetted pores. The larger the pore, the lower the pressure at which a bubble or stream of bubbles will form. The detailed procedure is described in reference 134. 2.4.1.2 SYSTEM CONTAMINATION/FILTER AREA The primary function of a filter is to prevent damage to contamination-sensitive components in the fluid system. "
What factors must be considered to accurately predict the required filter area for minimizing contaminants in a system's operating fluid?,"To ensure reliable performance of a system, it is necessary to reduce the contaminants that are entrained in the operating fluid to a level at which the | remaining particulate matter will not cause damage to the critical operating components. | The determination of how much filter area is needed is based on accurate prediction of the amount of system contamination that can be expected for any given application. "
What challenges arise in accurately forecasting system contamination due to different methods used in manufacturing and building components?,"Several companies and universities have been working on the problem of accurately predicting system contamination, but as yet no real solution is in sight. There appears to be no correlation between the actual and predicted amounts, sizes, and types of contaminants; the reason may be the variation in techniques utilized in manufacturing and building systems and components. A detailed description of some of the problems encountered may be found in references 135 through 138. "
What are some consequences of arbitrary compromises in determining contaminant levels in filter service life?,"The lack of a realistic basis for determining the amount or makeup of contaminant that is likely to pass through a filter during its service life has led to some arbitrary compromises. | In order to demonstrate that sufficient filter area has been provided for a particular design, a | specified amount of contaminant is required to be retained by the filter without exceeding some maximum differential pressure (contaminant tolerance). "
What are the two commonly utilized test contaminants for evaluating filter particle retention capabilities?,"The most frequently used test contaminants are AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts.* The two dusts may not ideally represent the true makeup of system contamination, but they do provide a baseline material for evaluating the ability of a filter to retain particles presented to the upstream side under flow conditions. The amount of dust to be presented to the filter is also an arbitrary compromise. | Reference 132 provides an excellent source of information on tests that were performed to | determine the contaminant tolerance of various filter materials for both gaseous and liquid , flow. "
"What type of particles caused the filter failures during engine testing, which were smaller than the absolute rating of the pneumatic filter?","A good example of a filter problem related to unpredictable system contamination occurred on the SSME. The main pneumatic filter had satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to retain a specified amount of AC-Coarse dust without creating excessive differential pressure. When engine testing began, several filter failures were caused by the sudden accumulation of fine contaminants (smaller than the absolute rating (GBR) of the filter) that plugged the pores | *These test dusts are Natural Arizona Dust supplied by General Motors Phoenix Laboratory and classified to specific | particle-size distributions by the AC Spark Plug Division of General Motors Corporation. "
"What is the definition of the amount of contaminant left in a filter after cleaning, which may migrate into the subsequent system?","98 | | | | : and greatly increased the filter differential pressure. As a consequence of the higher | pressure, several filter elements ruptured. The source of the contaminants was the test facility plumbing. To resolve the problem, the quality of filtration in the test facility was made better than the quality of filtration called for in the engine system. 2.4.1.3 RESIDUAL FILTER CONTAMINATION | | Residual contamination is the amount of contaminant remaining in the filter after final cleaning that can potentially slough off and pass into the downstream system. "
What factors influence the efficiency and cost of the final cleaning process for filters in manufacturing?,"Contaminant | particles are accumulated by filters during the various stages of manufacturing. A last-stage | cleaning of the filter removes some percentage of the particles, the amount depending on | how rigorous the cleaning process is. To facilitate final cleaning, it is desirable therefore to | | limit the amount of contaminants accumulated by the filter during manufacture. Cleaning processes are expensive, and when a filter has accumulated a great deal of contaminant the | cost of final cleaning can often exceed fabrication costs by several orders of magnitude. "
What factor significantly influences the rate at which particles are released from a filter during its manufacturing process?,"To | limit the accumulation of particles during fabrication, assembly, and testing of filters, it is necessary to control the environment during these stages of manufacturing. All filters used in the Space Shuttle flight system must conform to the requirements of reference 131 to | minimize residual contamination. The cleanliness level (residual contamination) actually is a measure of the particle release rate of the filter and therefore is greatly affected by the | intensity of the sampling method. "
What is the relationship between operating environment severity and the potential for particle sloughing in filtration systems?,"Normal practice is to test only the effluent side of the filter for particle release while subjecting the element to a sonically-induced cavitational | field (ref. 139). It should be emphasized that cleanliness levels specified for filters are only | an indication of particles that can potentially slough off. If the operating environment is not | as severe as the sampling method, the potential for sloughing particles decreases | proportionately. "
Which filter materials are prone to particulate contaminant presence due to their manufacturing method?,"2.4.1.4 FILTER MATERIAL AS CONTAMINANT Media migration is a commonly used term for the presence in the system fluid of particulate | contaminant identifiable as originating in the filter element or filter-supporting structure. Some filter materials are subject to media migration more than others because of the ! method of manufacturing. Filter materials subject to migration are sintered porous metal, pressed paper, matted fiber, glass fiber, sintered plastic, fired porcelain, bonded carbon, and bonded stone (ref. "
What testing methods are commonly used to assess media migration in terms of thermal conditions and mechanical disturbances?,"12). Methods of testing for media migration vary considerably, and standards for verification of migration vary even more. In general, the most accepted method involves a combination of | thermal-shock and vibration tests. A filter is exposed to its lowest service temperature for a | period of time and then is rapidly transferred to its highest service-temperature environment | for an equal period; this procedure is repeated for several cycles. After the thermal shock | , | 99 | | | | | } N. "
What method is used to analyze particles collected from a fluid after a vibrating test on a filter?,"tests, the filter is subjected to a vibration environment commensurate with its serviceenvironment for a specified period of time. On completion of testing, the filter is flushedwith a specified amount of fluid (usually 500 ml of Freon TF); the fluid is collected andpassed through a 0.454 membrane pad. The membrane pad then is analyzed for particles"
What types of materials are mentioned as being part of the sample collected?,"identifiable as filter or supporting-structure material. Unfortunately, the sample collected is | composed not only of possible media particles but also has residual-contamination particles."
"What analysis is necessary when particles are metallic, and how should the filter material be treated in relation to remaining substances?","In the simplest case, if the particles are all nonmetallic and the filter is constructed entirelyof metal, it can be concluded that no media migration has occurred. If the particles are |metallic, further analysis is required, and filter material must be distinguished from residual"
What type of equipment is used to identify individual particles in a representative sample?,Individual particles from a representative sample of the pad can be identified with | | equipment such as an electron microprobe X-ray analyzer. Comparison of the chemical
What factors contribute to the high cost and time consumption of particle analysis for assessing media migration?,analysis of a representative number of the particles with the filter-material chemistryprovides the basis for determining if media migration has occurred. This kind of analysis is | expensive and time consuming and is resorted to only when a visual microscopicIt has been the practice on occasion to utilize the cleanliness-level (residual contamination)
What is the criterion for a basis to be considered valid for verifying media migration?,requirements as the basis for media-migration verification. The basis is acceptable so long as
What demonstrates that the hydraulic filter for the SSME meets cleanliness-level standards without media movement?,"the actual residual-contamination particle counts fall well below the maximum particlecounts specified. If the cleanliness-level requirements are stringent, the above method is not : used. For example, the hydraulic filter for the SSME satisfactorily demonstrated no media |migration. The pneumatic filter for the same engine had more stringent requirements, and !"
What action must be taken if the particle counts after a test surpass the permitted cleanliness levels?,the post-test particle counts exceeded the cleanliness allowable counts. It was necessary to
What challenges arise when predicting the differential pressure resulting from a specific flow rate in filter-element design?,"resort to electron microprobe X-ray analysis in order to verify that the particles were not comprised of filter or structure material. 2.4.1.5 PRESSURE DROP | Prediction of the differential pressure created by a given flowrate presents one of the moredifficult problems in filter-element design. Generally, in the case of a surface-type element,"
What can be said about the pressure change across filter materials regardless of their mesh size?,the pressure drop across the filter medium for either fine or coarse mesh is relatively small
What method is typically employed to create flowrate versus differential pressure graphs after manufacturing a specific component?,when compared with the loss created by the element entrance or exit configuration.

What effect can excessive system-transient pressure have on the structure of a filter element?,": | | System-transient differential pressures that exceed the nominal can result in deformation of the filter element. The deformation can change the flow resistance of the filter, particularly | in the case of a tightly pieated woven-wire-cloth configuration. The pleats can become pinched together, thus reducing the effective area of the filter. In cases where high | system-transient differential pressures exist, a coarse backup screen is used to support the 1 woyen-wire-cloth element. "
What issue arose with the fine filter installed in the LEM ascent engine related to performance after a certain operational duration?,"| A good example of a problem with filter pressure drop occurred in development of the LEM ascent engine. A coarse filter upstream of the injector was found to be inadequate because fine particles contained in the propellant that passed through tended to plug the holes in the | thrust chamber injector. A fine pleated-wire-mesh filter was installed between the coarse filter and the injector. The new filter, however, caused a new problem: after a period of i time, performance shifts during engine operation were noted. "
What was the primary cause of performance shifts in the filter's efficiency?,"The shifts in the performance ; were found to be due to a change in the resistance of the filter caused by pressure surges ihe that distorted the pleated elements. A redesign of the element to eliminate the pleats resolved the problem. | | 2.4.1.6 TESTING | Filters are not acceptance tested with the actual propellants used in engines because of the | ~ difficulties (e.g., facility requirements or safety considerations) in testing with cryogenics or highly toxic or corrosive propellants. "
What are the common test fluids used for qualification tests in place of actual propellants?,"Qualification tests generally are not performed with ec actual propellants unless adequate safety precautions can be taken. At present, test fluids | include Freon TF, hydraulic oil, trichloroethylene, water, isopropanol, and denatured | ethanol. During evaluation or performance-demonstration tests, it is essential that the fluid | and contaminants used produce test data that can be related to the system requirements. "
What factors influence the design and efficiency of a filter case in fluid filtration systems?,"| | 2.4.2 Filter Case 4 The filter case functions as the structural supporting member of the filter element. Space | Ri available, serviceability, pressure drop, fluid compatibility, operating temperature, and , operating pressure — all enter into the filter case design. The size and shape of the case influence the filter capacity and service life. The minimization of flow restrictions and abrupt changes in flow direction is an important parameter. "
What is the significance of identifying the smallest cross-sectional area in a flow passage for a designer?,The critical area — the smallest | cross-sectional area of the flow passage — must be identified by the designer. All other flow passages naturally will have a greater area than the critical area. The flow transition from | * one chamber to another is made as smooth as practical. he In-line cases with axial-design cylindrical or conical filter elements offer the least resistance | to flow and are lightest in weight. 
What are the considerations for designing filter cases in relation to their assembly methods and maintenance in spaceflight applications?,"The case may be either permanently assembled by welding, or it may be capable of disassembly to facilitate cleaning or replacement of the | | element. Because filter elements are designed to have a service life commensurate with the 101 s | | | life of the engine system, case designs that permit removal and replacement of the element | without actually breaking into the fluid system are seldom used in spaceflight applications. "
What are the four types of interface connections in engine-system plumbing?,"Interface connections depend upon the particular philosophy in engine-system plumbing; they may be either threaded, welded, brazed-union, or flanged. Threaded connections (straight thread) are the least desirable type in that contamination is generated as the case is installed in the system; pipe thread connections are extremely undesirable and are rarely 7 used. Welded connections provide a leaktight system, but are difficult to inspect; | electron-beam welding or other high-quality welding techniques commonly are used to | achieve leaktight connections. "
What design feature prevents accidental omission of the filter component in a filter-case?,"Welded filter assemblies are used wherever appropriate. : a, Flanged connections result in the cleanest system assembly, but some external leakage may occur at the interface if the seal is inadequate. | An important consideration in filter-case design is to ensure that the filter element cannot rs| be inadvertently left out. This can be accomplished by making the element an integral part of one end of the case or by making the installation such that omission of the filter element + results in failure to pass a test designed to detect that omission. "
What should be minimized in the centerline geometry of the line to reduce the need for flexible joints?,"A less desirable approach is to ensure by visual inspection that the filter element has been installed. | x | - | | | | , ; | | | 102 | ® \ 7 | 3.

"
What is the primary purpose of flex joints in multi-leg duct designs?,"| Until the development of the SSME, no analytical method existed for achieving this objective; however, reference 140 presents a method for a three-joint, one-plane system that gives some insight into the subject. Generally in a multi-leg duct design, one flex joint is located in each leg for maximum flexibility. See figure 5 for the typical wraparound, gimbal-plane configuration. Kinematic design layouts locating the flex joints in their optimum positions are ian recommended as the best technique for providing initial inputs into a space-frame program | like that used on the SSME; the program then can be used to “fine-tune” the locations. "
What should be assessed to ensure that loads from joints comply with the engine or structural capacity?,"Once the joints are located, verify that the loads they create are within the capabilities of the attached engine or vehicle structure. | 3.1.1.1.2 Hard Lines | | The centerline geometry of the line shall be such that the line does not impose | excessive strain on attached structure. | | Prior to laying out the centerline geometry of a new hardline design, consider the structural | limitations of the components to which the line will be attached. "
What factors must be evaluated to determine the installation tolerances of a hard line within a vehicle's engine?,Line installation tolerances | in the engine or vehicle and the loads they would cause the hard line to induce on the attaching components must be evaluated. The routing of the line then should be such as to i provide required flexibility without producing excessive strains on the attaching structure. | Figure 4 depicts some typical routings that provide installation flexibility. Utilize the 5 modulus of elasticity and wall thickness of the hardline material to assist in providing | necessary flexibility. 
What is the maximum number of types of deflection a flexible joint in a duct should absorb simultaneously?,"103 B } | | Whenever practical, adjacent lines should be routed in banks or rows to achieve mutual | support in bracketing and add to aesthetic appeal. | 3.1.1.2 DEFLECTION LIMITATION | | The routing of ducts shall preclude the requirement for a given flexible joint to | absorb more than one type of deflection (angular, axial, or shear) simultaneously. | Locate the flexible joints in the duct so as to make maximum use of their deflection | | capability.

What factors should be considered to prevent excessive bending stresses in a bellows joint during simultaneous deflections?,"Figure 5 gives a practical example for achieving this condition. Locate the centers of the bellows on the gimbal axes, so that the bellows are required only to angulate to | accommodate gimballing; if they are located off-center, both shear and angulation will be rs applied. | ¥ 3.1.1.2.1 Maximum Bellows Joint Deflection | | The sum of all deflections simultaneously imposed on a bellows joint shall not , cause bending stresses in excess of those commensurate with the design fatigue . "
What should be done if a bellows cannot achieve its design fatigue life due to combined motions and stress?,"| See reference 82 for S-N data on typical bellows materials. When a bellows is subjected to | more than one mode of deflection (e.g., angulation and shear) simultaneously, the sum of < | the stresses created by all modes must not exceed the total allowable. | | If a particular bellows is subjected to combined motions and attendant stresses that do not permit the part to meet the design fatigue life, the motions must be reduced or additional bellows introduced into the system to share the deflections. "
What type of stresses are generated in the crowns and roots of convolutions when absorbing different modes of deflection in a bellow?,"For example, the duct shown in figure 8 was required to accommodate a torsional deflection that caused excessive strains in the axial bellows. To resolve the problem, a special bellows was inserted between the two ] axial bellows to absorb only the torsional deflections and thus relieve the torsional strain ; imposed on the other bellows. All the different deflection modes that a bellows can absorb result in the application of the same type of bending stresses in the crowns and roots of the convolutions. "
What approaches are recommended to reduce torsional forces on duct assemblies in design?,"Specific information on stress calculations corresponding to different types of deflections is presented in references 141 through 151.

What should be minimized during a change in flow direction to ensure efficient fluid dynamics?,"| The configuration for a change in flow direction (e.g., a bend or tapoff branch) | shall minimize the pressure loss that accompanies a direction change. | Where routing permits, use bends with R/D values that produce the lowest loss coefficients. An example of a graph for determining pressure loss in a circular 90° elbow is shown in » figure 47 and discussed in reference 8. Friction loss in bend length must be added to bend loss to obtain total loss. "
What design consideration decreases pressure loss in tapoff branches by influencing their orientation relative to approaching fluid?,4 Flow guide vanes (fig. 9) are recommended for reducing losses in short-radius bends. The selection of the final configuration requires a tradeoff between flow efficiency and producibility. Analyze vane flutter to ensure that no vibration during operation is induced by system fluid oscillations. Pressure loss in tapoff branches can be minimized by aligning the tapoffs toward oncoming flow (fig. 48(a)) rather than at a right angle to the flow (fig. 
What factors must be considered when evaluating the trade-offs between joint structure quality and pressure gain in a specific configuration?,"48(b)).

For an external gimbal ring, the diameter of the ring should be kept as close to the bellows OD as possible to minimize bending moments in the ring. : | | 130 | . | 3.2.2.1.2 Load-Deflection Capability 2 The linkage shall be capable of permitting the design deflection of the bellows while restraining against pressure separating load and other external loads applied to the duct. "
What methods can be utilized to prevent overdeflection that may cause damage to components in a mechanical linkage system?,"Ensure in the design layout phase that no linkage binding can occur under the maximum accumulation of manufacturing tolerances within the maximum specified deflection of the | joint or duct. In complex linkages, a wooden or aluminum mockup is recommended as a | physical check before committing expensive hardware in the shop. | 3.2.2.1.3 Excursion-Limiting Stops | . Excursion-limiting stops on the linkage shall prevent overdeflection and possible | damage to the bellows. "
What type of bearings should be utilized in the pin joints of hinge and gimbal linkages to maintain minimal friction?,Use limiting stops machined integrally with the bellows linkage. Adjustable stops are not | recommended because of the possibility of error in adjustment. Verify by test that the stops prevent overdeflection. | 3.2.2.1.4 Articulating Friction | | The linkage bearing friction shall be a minimum consistent with the system loads | limitations. Use journal-type bearings in the pin joints of hinge and gimbal linkages. 
"What lubricant, applied to journal and pin surfaces, can reduce friction if lower values are required?","Metal-on-metal | bearings may be used or, if a lower friction coefficient is desired, solid dry-film lubricant (molybdenum disulfide) may be applied to both journal and pin surfaces. Bearing pressures of 20 000 to 30 000 psi have been successfully accommodated with dry lubricant. When the | bearings are in the flow path, care should be exercised to use only lubricants chemically ! compatible with the environmental fluids, particularly in oxidizer service. "
What is the relationship between spring rate and structural capabilities in flexible-joint assemblies?,"| In some applications it may be necessary to use antifriction bearings, as in the case of the | ball joint (fig. 26), when the turning radius of the bearing is large and would require an excessive rotating moment if plain bearing surfaces were used. | 3.2.2.1.5 Bending Moment | The spring rate of a flexible-joint assembly shall be consistent with the structural | capabilities of the flex-joint and duct next-assembly mounting points and, in the | case of gimballing ducts, with the actuator forces available. "
What factors contribute to the bending moment required for angular deflection in a flex joint assembly?,"| | | | 131 | | | The moment required to deflect a flex joint assembly angularly must overcome the inherent spring rate of the metal bellows, the friction between plies (if the bellows is multi-ply), the friction in the bearings of the linkage, and a bellows-straightening-moment geometric effect. Reference 166 presents a method for calculating the bending moment of a flex joint taking all of these factors into account. "
What is the significance of properly centering the length of the bellows on the pivot point of the restraining mechanism?,"A computer program for making the calculations is included in the reference. 3.2.2.1.6 Centering of Pivot Point The pivot point of the restraining mechanism shall ensure full deflection utilization of the bellows and thereby lowest bending stress., The live length of the bellows should be carefully centered on the pivot point of the restraining mechanism. This centering is especially important in the case of the internal chain-link restraint, where the pivot point can be in one of two different locations, one link | diameter apart, the location depending on the plane in which angulation is taking place. "
What systems utilized the design shown in Figure 57 for their turbine-exhaust system?,"| Figure 57 shows the recommended design, which was used in the turbine-exhaust system of the H-1, J-2, and Phoebus systems.

"
What feature is suggested to mitigate the impact of pivot point variations in a chain-link restraint design for centering bellows?,"— Recommended design for centering bellows live length in chain-link restraint. If the fatigue life is sensitive to variations in pivot point (as in the example in section 2.2.2.1), a ball bearing should be installed between the links to offset the inherent effect of | change in pivot-point location with links alone. A recommended design, used on the Titan II and III booster and sustainer engines, is shown in figure 58. "

"
What type of restraint is recommended for closely coupled ducts with flexible joints near bolted flanges to distribute loads?,"| Normally, when a length of hard line > 2 D, is adjacent to a flexible joint, the concentrated 1 loads are evenly distributed over the circumference of the hard line and thus do not represent a problem. In closely coupled ducts where the flexible joints are located very near to the end-connecting bolted flanges of the duct, the external-ball-joint type of restraint is recommended for distributing the load within a short length of duct. "
What type of joint is recommended to accommodate volume changes in a tension-type system while avoiding pressure separating loads?,"This design, shown in figure 26, may use plain spherical bearings or ball bearings if low bending moment is a | requirement. : 3.2.2.2 THRUST-COMPENSATING LINKAGES Straight sections of ducting that require large axial travel ina tension-type system Shall not produce pressure separating loads on the attached structure. Use a thrust-compensating joint to compensate for volume changes without creating a pressure separating load on the attached structure. "
What type of loads should be avoided when installing compression-type bellows to prevent damage to connecting hardware or the bellows?,"There are many different concepts for the thrust-compensating design. Figures 31, 32, and 33 show three acceptable designs. 4 | 3.2.2.3 COMPRESSION SYSTEM The installation of unrestrained (compression-type) bellows shall preclude axial or | | bending loads that may overload connecting hardware or buckle the bellows. Locate the bellows so the pressure-separating-force vector passes through the center of the | duct mounting points; if necessary, bellows can be installed with a biased shear deflection to | offset the effect of thermal expansion during operation (fig. "
What factor should be prioritized when joining bellows to ducts to ensure maximum strength and quality?,"35). This principle can be applied to axial deflection in the same installation. If the bellows is extended when installed, | thermal expansion of the duct compresses the bellows toward neutral (i.e., to its free length). | | 133 | | 3.2.3 Bellows-to-Duct Attachment 3.2.3.1 JOINT QUALITY | The method for joining the bellows to the duct shall provide a joint of the highest strength and highest quality consistent with other requirements. "
"What type of weld is recommended to join the bellows neck to the duct, ensuring it is suitable for radiographic inspection?","| Use a butt weld for joining the bellows neck to the duct (fig. 36). This technique provides a Class I weld (radiographically inspectable) and eliminates any stress-raising crevices that also could entrap contamination. In the case of thin-gage materials, a burndown weld, which also ' in the end result is a butt weld, should be used. When butt welds are impractical, a lap joint can be used, but it should be welded on both ID and OD. "
What type of welding is recommended for joining multi-ply bellows to a duct section in high heat flux conditions?,"Lap joints have little advantage other than being self-aligning for assembly ease. | To attach multi-ply bellows to a mating duct section, the multi-ply bellows end should be resistance welded and trimmed through the center of the nugget, or joined by another welding method. The resulting edge should then be butt welded to the mating duct. 3.2.3.1.1 Joint for High-Heat-Flux Region | Bellows-to-duct junctions subject to high heat fluxes and attendant thermal gradients shall be resistant to thermal fatigue failure. "
What type of welds should be used for the attachments between the bellow and duct in the recommended design?,A recommended design for this application is the forged Y-ring (fig. 59).

What types of liners are suggested to minimize flow-induced vibration and pressure loss in bellows attachment designs?,"— Recommended bellows-attachment design for high-heat-flux region. 134 | ) | | 3.2.4 Flow Liners Flow liners shall protect the bellows from flow-induced vibration and reduce pressure loss. Recommended designs are full cantilevered liners, short conical liners, and half liners (fig. 40). A liner cantilevered from the upstream end and having a scalloped leading edge for flexibility to ease installation and fitup into the duct wall plus additional weld length for structural purposes can be used for bellows designed for axial deflection. "
What is the purpose of using short conical liners in applications involving vibration and pressure loss?,"Short conical liners can also be used; they can provide vibration protection and reduction in pressure loss equal to those of a full-length liner. For an angulating bellows, a half-liner from each end will minimize interference of the free end with the flow stream when the bellows is in the maximum deflected position. | Although liners for flexible hose have been investigated, none have been successful enough to warrant recommendation. "
What considerations must be taken into account when designing a liner for bellows to prevent interference with deflection functions?,3.2.4.1 LINER BINDING | Flow liners for bellows shall perform the required flow function without interfering with the bellows deflection function. | Design the liner with sufficient clearance so that it will not bottom out against ducting | structure under extreme bellows deflection conditions and thereby produce high reactive loads at the duct-attach points. Careful design layout of the bellows position with respect to the liner at maximum fabrication and deflection-excursion tolerances will ensure successful operation in all deflected positions. 
What design features must be included in flow liners to ensure effective cleaning and pressure management?,| 3.2.4.2 LINER DRAINAGE Flow liner design shall provide for proper cleaning and pressure relief. | | Provide drain holes in flow liners for drainage of entrapped cleaning fluids or other contaminants. The holes also permit some relief of the pressure differential across the liner | | wall caused by sudden changes in flow through the bellows. 3.2.4.3 LINER COLLAPSE STRENGTH | Flow liners shall be capable of withstanding operational flow and pressure cycling | without collapse. 
What factors should be considered during preliminary design to avoid failures due to external pressure on structural liners?,"| The liner wall thickness should be sufficient to prevent collapse under the worst possible | 135 | | pressure differential. Reference 111 presents an analytical technique for a specific case that could be adapted for more general use. | An analysis should be made, in the preliminary design stage, of the possibility of flow conditions creating an external pressure on the liner. References 95 and 96 attest to inadequate design analysis of this condition and subsequent costly failures in the field. "
What should be used in a flexible-hose assembly to avoid excessive deflections or pressure losses at bends?,3.3 FLEXIBLE HOSE | 3.3.1 Routing The design criteria and recommended practices for line-assembly routing (section 3.1.1) are also applicable to flexible-hose assemblies. | 3.3.1.1 BEND CONFIGURATION | A bend in a flexible-hose assembly shall not cause excessive deflections or pressure losses in the flexible-hose elements. Use a hard-tube elbow connected by straight lengths of flexible hose in the bend ofa line. 
"What factor should be considered when choosing between designs, particularly regarding vibration issues?","| Undesirable and preferred configurations are shown in figure 60. Although the configuration on the left is undesirable from the standpoint of steady-state stress and high pressure loss, it may be less susceptible to vibration modes perpendicular to the plane of the elbow than the version on the right, which, particularly in large-diameter high-pressure applications, would be quite stiff. If vibration is a problem, a tradeoff of the | | attributes of each design should be made before making a selection. "

What calculations are necessary to determine the total loss coefficient in relation to the innercore diameter and hardline diameter ratios?,"Design the convolution geometry and line size to minimize | | friction loss. | 3.3.2.2 INNERCORE/HARDLINE RELATION Where pressure drop is critical, the inner diameters of the hard line and innercore shall be optimized for minimum total pressure loss. For minimum pressure loss, calculate the total loss coefficient (expansion + innercore + contraction) for a range of ratios of innercore diameter to hardline ‘diameter. "
What is the diameter ratio associated with the least total loss coefficient?,"Select the diameter ratio with the minimum total loss coefficient. | 3.3.3 Innercore | The design criteria and recommended practices for bellows on pressure capability (sec. 3.2.1.1), fatigue life (sec. 3.2.1.2), corrosion resistance (sec. 3.2.1.4), and manufacturing (sec. 3.2.1.5) apply equally to flexible hoses. The criteria and practices on vibration (secs. | 3.2.1.2.1 through 3.2.1.2.3) apply also, except that the innercore ordinarily is braid-restrained to vibrate only in the individual-convolution mode. "
"What materials are recommended for hoses in dynamic and temperature-variable environments, and what should be avoided in cryogenic applications?","3.3.3.1 OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY The innercore shall withstand dynamic deflections and temperature extremes. In general, use metal hoses in all vehicle applications unless pressure drop is a critical factor | and the environment is compatible with the nonmetals. | | | 137 | | | Hoses with a nonmetal innercore (e.g., Teflon, Kel-F, rubber) are not recommended for use in cryogenic applications, especially when pressure surges or dynamic deflections are involved, because they are subject to brittle fracture. "
What should be minimized to reduce loads on the actuator at the engine-to-airframe connection when multiple hoses are bent together?,"They also are not recommended for temperatures above 500°F because of loss of strength and chemical decomposition. 3.3.3.2 BENDING MOMENT | Bending moments of flexible hoses that cross the gimballed engine-to-airframe | interface shall be as low as possible. | The objective is to minimize loads on the gimbal actuator, particularly when many hoses are flexed as a bundle. All design variables such as wall thickness, number of plies, live length, and routing should be optimized to yield the lowest bending moment. "
What is the function of the braid restraint in a flexible-hose system when pressure is applied?,Further reduction is possible through the application of a bonded dry-film lubricant to the outer surfaces of the innercore and to all surfaces of the restraining braid. 3.3.3.3 BUCKLING STABILITY Flexible-hose braid restraint shall provide buckling stability when the hose is pressurized. Do not constrain the flexible-hose elements in the line by clamps or brackets. They must be free to the extent that they can expand freely in the axial direction and permit the braid to | tighten sufficiently to restrain the innercore from buckling. 
What characteristics should the braid configuration have to ensure proper movement of the hose assembly without causing any deflection issues?,"On this account, choose the | length of braid so that it will tighten as required under load (sec. 3.3.4.2). 3.3.4 Braid | 3.3.4.1 FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT The braid configuration shall permit the hose assembly to angulate freely. | Braid in which the wires bottom out when angulated and thus prevent incomplete or unequal innercore deflection should be avoided. 138 ia ik tT ue” i. fined Sa 6.94204 Tie?

Provide sufficient braid-wire cross-sectional area to restrain the proof-pressure separating force of the innercore without yielding. "
How does the flexible section maintain its pressure retention ability when subjected to burst pressure conditions?,Use equation (2) to determine the end strength of a | braid. Determine axial growth due to tautening of the braid after application of proof pressure. Utilize manufacturing experience or equation (4) to predetermine the amount of stretch so that the flexible section will be within length tolerances after proof pressure is | applied. 3.3.4.3 PRESSURE CAPABILITY | The flexible section shall retain its pressure-carrying capability during application of burst pressure. 
What criteria must be considered to determine the appropriate cross-sectional area of braid wire for restraining burst-pressure forces in a pressure-carrying hose?,"Provide sufficient braid-wire cross-sectional area to restrain the burst-pressure separating force of the innercore. Use adequate braid to meet the burst-pressure requirement. Utilize equations (2) and (3) for determining braid-limited burst pressure (pressure above which the hose will leak or lose pressure). Some yielding is permitted, but the hose must retain its pressure-carrying ability. Also ensure that the braid will meet the nonyielding proof-pressure requirement. "
What type of weld is recommended for securing the innercore to the tube adapter in small-diameter braided metal hoses?,"| 3.3.5 End Construction | End construction for flexible metal hose shall provide structural integrity for | braid attachment and innercore-to-tube end attachment under all operational conditions. | For small-diameter (< 3 in.) braided metal hoses to be used in the cryogenic to +400°F range, the end construction shown in figure 44(a) is recommended.

Control the environment during fabrication, assembly, and testing. Use the SAE ARP599 ! (ref. 139) test method with modification. When flow can occur in either direction, conduct the test for both the upstream and downstream sides separately by flowing through the filter in both directions. "
What volume and increment size should each sample consist of for flow checked on the downstream side?,"When flow is in one direction, the downstream side only need be | 141 | : | | | checked. The exception to ARP 599 is that each sample should be 500 ml in 5 equal increments of 100 ml.
