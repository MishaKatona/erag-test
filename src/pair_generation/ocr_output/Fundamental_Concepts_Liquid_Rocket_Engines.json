According to\nNewton\u2019s third law of motion (to every action there is always opposed an equal\nreaction), the continuous ejection of a stream of hot gases in one direction causes a\nsteady motion of the rocket in the opposite direction.\n\nA couple of propellants comprises a fuel and an oxidiser. A fuel is a substance,\nsuch as liquid hydrogen (H2) or a mixture of hydrocarbons, which burns in the\npresence of oxygen to form the hot gases which are accelerated and then ejected at\nhigh speed through a nozzle. An oxidiser is either liquid oxygen (Oz) or a substance\nreleasing oxygen, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O>), nitrous oxide (N20), nitronium\nperchlorate (NO,CI1O,), or another substance, such as fluorine (F), having a strong\ntendency to accept electrons. The oxidiser combines with the fuel in a proper mixture\nratio, as will be shown in Sect. 1.2.\n\nFour categories of high-thrust rocket motors may be identified, according to the\nphysical state of the propellants carried within such rockets. These categories are\nsolid-propellant motors, liquid-propellant engines, gaseous-propellant engines and\nhybrid-propellant engines, the last of them being those which use propellants stored\nin at least two of the three (solid, liquid, and gaseous) physical states of matter.\nThe following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA-JPL [1], shows a scheme of a\npump-fed liquid bi-propellant rocket engine.\n\u00a9 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license 1\nto Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021\nA. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines,\n\nSpringer Aerospace Technology,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_1\n",

In\nthe rocket engine illustrated above, the magnitude F of the thrust vector F depends\non the propellant mass flow rate 7 = dm/dt through the engine, on the magnitude\nve of the exit velocity vector v, of the exhaust gas, and on the pressure p, of the gas\nat the exit plane of the nozzle.\n\nThe principle of functioning of a converging-diverging nozzle (also known as a\nde Laval nozzle, after the name of its inventor, Gustaf de Laval) is illustrated in the\nfollowing figure, due to the courtesy of NASA-JPL [1].\n\nDe Laval Nozzle\nFlow velocity increases from green to red.\n\nAs has been shown by Crown [2], a compressible fluid at virtually zero velocity\nin the combustion chamber is accelerated through the converging portion of the\nnozzle to sonic speed (M = 1) in the throat where, if the converging portion is\nproperly designed, the flow is uniform and parallel. The fluid is then expanded in the\ndiverging portion of the nozzle until the desired Mach number M > | is reached in\nthe test section, where the flow is again uniform and parallel.\n\nIn other words, the cross-section (perpendicular to the gas flow) of the nozzle\nimmediately downstream of the combustion chamber decreases, in order for the\nsubsonic flow (M < 1) to increase its speed up to the speed of sound (M = 1).\n\nThe sonic flow condition is reached in the throat, where the cross-sectional area A\nof the nozzle reaches its minimum value A,. In order for the flow to increase further its\n",
    "11": "1.1 The Generation of Thrust 3\nspeed in supersonic conditions (M > 1), the exhaust gases must expand downstream\nof the throat, and therefore the cross-sectional area A of the nozzle must increase\n(A > A,). This is because, in the converging portion of the nozzle, the maximum\nuniform velocity which can be reached by the flow in any section is the velocity\ncorresponding to the local velocity of sound. Further increases in velocity can only\nbe obtained by expanding the gas in the subsequent diverging portion of the nozzle.\nFor optimum performance in terms of thrust, the gas pressure, p-, at the exit plane\nof the nozzle should be exactly equal to the pressure, po, due to the environment\naround it. In the vacuum of space (po = 0), this is impossible. The bigger the exit\narea, A., of the nozzle, the closer the rocket gets to the optimum thrust. However,\nat some point, the additional thrust gained is not worth the added mass which is\nnecessary to make the exit area bigger. In conditions of optimum expansion ratio,\nthe rocket motor produces the maximum thrust. A nozzle, which ends before the\nexhaust gas reaches the pressure of the outside environment, is called an under-\nexpanded nozzle. In these conditions, the rocket does not get all the thrust available\nfrom its engine, because the expansion ratio is too low, and therefore the exhaust\ngas pressure is greater than the environmental pressure. By contrast, a nozzle, whose\ncross-sectional area at the exit plane is too large, is called an over-expanded nozzle.\nThis occurs when the expansion ratio A,/A, is too high, and the pressure of the exhaust\ngas is less than the environmental pressure. Since the cross-sectional area at the exit\nplane A, is too large, then the exhaust gas completely expands before reaching the\nexit plane of the nozzle. The gas flow downstream of the exit plane, as a function of\nthe ambient pressure, is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA\n[3].\n\u2014< | This is what happens when the ambient pressure is\nless than the nozzle flow exit pressure\ncc | This is what happens when the ambient pressure is\nexactly the same as the nozzle flow exit pressure.\n= This is what happens when the ambient pressure is a\nbit more than the nozzle flow exit pressure.

Therefore, for a constant mass flow rate m or weight flow rate\nW = gom of exhaust gas, the thrust F is proportional to the velocity v,. of the gas at\nthe exit plane.\nP, \u2014 a or\n6 po a\nZ\n2\nGETET =e\nPa =H :\nF\u2014<\u2014 - A \u2014> va\nZ\n2\nCope\nSs Py\na a J Ae\nA spacecraft is subject not only to the thrust due to its engine, but also to the\npressure, po, due to the environment around it. At high altitudes, po can be assumed\nto be equal to zero. In these conditions, the net force acting on the gas contained in\nthe thrust chamber (comprising the combustion chamber and the nozzle) is the sum\nof the reactions coming from the walls and of the reaction of the absolute pressure\nof gas at the exit plane. These two reaction forces are opposed, as shown in the\npreceding figure.\nTherefore, according to the second principle of dynamics, the net force acting on\nthe gas must be equal to the momentum flux out of the thrust chamber, which is\n0\nJ peta \u2014 A, Pe = mve\nAte\nwhere A,, and pj are respectively the area and the pressure of the thrust chamber, A,,\nVe, and p, are respectively the area, the gas velocity, and the static absolute pressure\nof the gas at the exit plane of the nozzle, and mi is the steady mass flow rate of the gas.\nThe integral, that is, the first term on the left-hand side of the preceding equation,\n",

This integral is\njust the force, F, which acts on the thrust chamber (and, therefore, on the spacecraft).\nConsequently, the preceding equation may also be written as follows\n\nF=my. + Acpe\n\nThis equality holds under the following hypotheses:\n\ne the injection flow velocity of the propellants is negligible;\n\n\u00a2 the flow is constant and does not change with time during the burn;\n\n\u00a2 the products of combustion are in chemical equilibrium after the burn;\n\ne the flow of gas through the exit plane of the nozzle is one-dimensional, that is, all\nthe molecules of the ejected gas move on straight lines which are parallel to the\naxis of symmetry of the nozzle;\n\ne the flow is compressible, that is, the gas density is subject to significant changes;\n\ne the flow is isentropic, that is, frictionless and adiabatic (without heat loss), and\ntherefore depends only on the cross-sectional areas of the nozzle; and\n\ne the gas flowing in the nozzle is a perfect gas, so that the well-known equation\nof state p = pRT involving pressure p, density p, and temperature T can be\nused, where R is the constant of the specific gas (the universal gas constant R*\n= 8314.460 N m kmol\u2122! K\u2122! divided by the average molar mass M (kg/kmol)\nof the exhaust gas; for example, if the exhaust gas were water, H2O, then R =\n8314.460/18 = 461.9 N mkg\u2122! K~!).\n\nIn the thrust equation written above, the quantity 7i is called the momentum thrust,\nand the quantity A,p, is called the pressure thrust. The latter term indicates that some\n(but not all) of the total forces due to the pressure p,- in the thrust chamber contribute\nto the kinetic energy possessed by the exhaust gases flowing in the nozzle. In other\nwords, a part of the gas pressure generated by the release of chemical energy is used\nto increase the gas momentum, whereas another part is not. The greater the part of\ngas pressure used for this purpose, the greater the efficiency of the nozzle.\n\nLet us assume now that the rocket is fired at an ambient pressure po greater than\nzero, that is, at low-altitudes. In these conditions, the pressure forces due to the\nenvironment and acting on the outside of the thrust chamber walls have no effect on\nthe gas inside. However, such pressure forces subtract a part (A-po) from the total\npressure thrust (A,p,). Since the exhaust gas flows at supersonic velocity through\nthe exit plane of area A,, then the ambient pressure po cannot gain access to it.\nTherefore, the ambient pressure generates a net unbalanced force onto the projected\nthrust chamber area, in the direction opposed to the thrust, of magnitude A.po. This\nfact is taken into account by re-writing the equation of thrust as follows\n\nF = myve + Ac(Pe \u2014 Po)\n",
    "14": "6 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines\nwhich is just the equation given in [1]. The same equation may also be written as\nfollows\nF = my. + A.(Pe \u2014 Po) = me\nwhere\nc=v+t Ae(Pe = Po)\nm\nis called the effective exhaust velocity, whose value is the same as that of the exhaust\ngas velocity v, at the exit plane of the nozzle only when the gas pressure p, at the same\nplane is equal to the ambient pressure po. As has been shown above, the presence\nof the second addend on the right-hand side of the preceding equation indicates that\nthe optimum value of v, has not been reached.\n\nAs an application of these concepts to a practical case, taken from [4], itis required\nto compute the exhaust gas velocity v, at the exit plane of the nozzle, the thrust in\nspace, and the effective exhaust velocities at sea level (c) and in space (cs), for a\nrocket engine having a thrust F = 4.448 x 10\u00b0 N at sea level, a mass flow rate\nmh = 167.5 kg/s due to propellant consumption, an area A, = 0.4905 m? at the exit\nplane of the nozzle, and an absolute pressure p. = 7.377 x 104 N/m? at the same\nplane. The atmospheric pressure po at sea level has the standard value 101325 ~\n1.013 x 10\u00b0 N/m?.\n\nIn order to compute the value of v., we use the equation of thrust written above\nsolved for v,, as follows\n\nF\u2014A.(pe\u2014 po) 4.448 x 10\u00b0 \u2014 0.4905 x (0.7377 \u2014 1.013) x 10\u00b0\n\nVe = -.- = i _\n\nm 167.5\n= 2736 m/s\n\nSince the pressure p, of the exhaust gas at the exit plane of the nozzle is smaller\nthan the atmospheric pressure po at sea level, then the nozzle of the rocket engine\nconsidered in the present example is too long for sea level conditions.\n\nDuring the ascent of the rocket, the value of the atmospheric pressure decreases\ncontinuously. When the rocket reaches a certain altitude h* above the sea level, the\natmospheric pressure at that altitude and the exhaust gas pressure p, at the exit plane\nof the nozzle have the same value (in the present case, this value is 7.377 x 10+\nN/m?), and therefore the value of the component A,(p. \u2014 po) of the thrust becomes\nequal to zero. This event represents an ideal expansion of the gas flow. At an altitude\nh greater than h*, the value of the atmospheric pressure pp becomes less than 7.377\nx 104 N/m?, and is equal to zero in space. When this happens, the value of the term\nA, Po, Which appears on the right-hand side of the equation of thrust, is also equal to\nzero.

Three of the four fundamental equations used for this purpose express the\nconservation of energy, mass, and momentum, and the fourth is the equation of state\nof perfect gases. They are shown below.\n\nThe energy equation (also known as the Bernoulli equation) states the principle\nof conservation of energy. In the hypotheses of Sect. 1.1, let us consider an adiabatic\nflow between two cross-sections (1 and 2) of a nozzle perpendicular to its axis of\nsymmetry, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5].\n",
    "16": "8 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines\n\nThe energy equation for an adiabatic flow between the two cross-sections shown\nabove can be written as follows [6]\n\nhy \u2014h (7, -1T) =! Evi\n~hh=c ~ = 21\n1 2 pi 2 7 J\nwhere J is the mechanical equivalent of heat (J = 1 because the SI is used in this\nbook, that is, because heat is measured in joules), h = u + p/p is the enthalpy per\nunit mass of the fluid, u is the internal energy per unit mass of the fluid, c, is the\nspecific heat of the fluid at constant pressure, and T is the temperature of the fluid.\nThe enthalpy measures the total energy of a thermodynamic system, and includes\nthe internal energy of the gas and the amount of energy required to make room for it\nby displacing its environment and establishing its density and its pressure.\n\nThe energy equation states that the energy per unit mass available for heat transfer,\nh, \u2014 ho, is converted into kinetic energy per unit mass, Vav3 - vt), of the flow. In\nother words, an amount of energy in form of heat possessed by the gas is used\nto increase the velocity of the flow. The term c,(T, \u2014 T2) indicates the decrease\nin temperature resulting from the energy conversion. The specific heat at constant\npressure, c,, has been assumed constant, and depends on the composition of the gas\nresulting from the combustion. In particular, when the cross-section | is located at the\nexit of the combustion chamber (subscript c), as shown in the preceding figure, then\nthere results v; ~ 0, T; = (T.)ns, V2 = v, and T, = T;. Therefore, for an isentropic\nflow (p/p\u2019 = constant), the energy equation can be written as follows\n\nTong = 71+ 2 2\n( ons = fi + \u201c2 i\n1\nan 2\\\"\n(Pe)ns = (1 + vu?)\n1 a\nYo ~\n(Pe)ns = a(1 + vu?)\nwhere M; = vj/a; is the Mach number at the nozzle inlet, y = c,/c, is the specific\nheat ratio of the gas, R is the specific constant of the gas, and a; = (yRT;)? is the\nsonic velocity of the flow at the nozzle inlet.\n\nThe second of the four fundamental equations mentioned above states the principle\nof mass conservation.

When\nused for rockets, hydrogen and oxygen are most often stored in their liquid state of\naggregation, at very low temperatures (cryogenic propellants). This is because they\ntake less space in the liquid state than in the gaseous state at normal temperature and\npressure conditions. Hydrogen remains liquid without evaporating at atmospheric\npressure (101325 N/m?) at a temperature not higher than 20 K, and oxygen does the\nsame at a temperature not higher than 90 K [9].\n\nAnother cryogenic fuel used for space propulsion is liquid methane (CH), which\nrequires a storage at a temperature not higher than 111 K [10].

Fluorine is extremely toxic and reacts violently with most substances\n[10]. Cryogenic propellants are difficult to store over long periods of time, due to the\nlow temperatures required by them. Therefore, they are not used in military rockets,\nwhich must be taken in a state of readiness for launch over times of several months.\nIn addition, liquid hydrogen requires a storage volume many times greater than that\nrequired by other fuels, because of its very low density (70.85 kg/m). On the other\nhand, the higher performance made available by cryogenic propellants makes them\nparticularly attractive when constraints of storage and reaction time are not critical.\nFor example, according to Aerojet Rocketdyne [11], the RS-25 engines aboard the\nSpace Shuttle orbiter use liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and have a specific\nimpulse in space (see Sect. 1.3) of 451 s. The RL10 engines on the Centaur, the US\nfirst liquid-hydrogen/liquid-oxygen rocket stage, have a specific impulse in space\nof 433 s [12]. The J-2 engines used on the Saturn V second and third stages and\non the second stage of the Saturn 1B also burn the liquid-hydrogen/liquid-oxygen\ncombination.

Ina few words, liquid\nhydrogen, in comparison with other fuels (such as kerosene), yields more power per\nunit volume of storage.\n\nWhen the fuel is a hydrocarbon (for example, kerosene), the oxidation reaction\nmay be represented [10] as follows\n\n2C\\2H26 + 250) + 24CO + 26H20 + heat\n\nIn each second, two kilomoles of dodecane (that is, 2 x 12 x 12+ 2 x 26=\n340 kg of dodecane) react with twenty-five kilomoles of oxygen (that is, 25 x 2 x\n16 = 800 kg of oxygen) to form twenty-four kilomoles of carbon monoxide (that is,\n24 x (12 + 16) = 672 kg of carbon monoxide) and twenty-six kilomoles of water\n(that is, 26 x (2 + 16) = 468 kg of water). The corresponding stoichiometric mixture\nratio (o/f) between the oxidiser (0) and the fuel (f) is\n\n2 = Me _ 800 4 35\nf my 340\n\nIt is to be noted that kerosene is a mixture of hydrocarbons. The chemical compo-\nsition of kerosene depends on its source. It usually consists of about ten different\nhydrocarbons, each of them containing from 10 to 16 carbon atoms per molecule; the\nconstituents include n-dodecane, alkyl benzenes, and naphthalene and its derivatives.\nKerosene is usually represented by the single compound n-dodecane. In particular,\nRP-1 is a special type of highly-refined kerosene which conforms to Military Spec-\nification MIL-R-25576 and is used as a fuel for rocket engines [10]. For example,\nRP-1 is used in the first-stage boosters of the Delta and Atlas-Centaur rockets. It\nalso powered the first stages of the Saturn 1B and Saturn V [10]. Hydrocarbon-based\nfuels do not pose the severe constraints of storage which are peculiar to cryogenic\nfuels. On the other hand, as has been shown above, the specific impulse yielded by\nthem is considerably less than that made available by cryogenic fuels.\n\nAnother class of substances used for space propulsion includes the hypergolic\npropellants, that is, specific couples of fuels and oxidisers which ignite sponta-\nneously and violently when one gets in touch with the other, without the need for any\nignition source. Such propellants remain liquid at normal temperatures. These prop-\nerties make them particularly suitable for propulsion and hydraulic power systems\ncarried aboard spacecraft, and in particular for those which are meant to be used\nfor orbital manoeuvring. On the other hand, hypergolic propellants are extremely\ntoxic and/or corrosive and must be handled with the highest care. The most common\nfuels used in hypergolic propellants are hydrazine (N2H4), monomethy! hydrazine\n(CH3(NH)NHz2), unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H2NN(CH3)2), and Aerozine\n50, the last being an equal mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl\nhydrazine.\n\nAccording to Nufer [15], the oxidisers used in combination with the fuels named\nabove are usually nitrogen tetroxide (N2Ox) and various blends of nitrogen tetroxide\n",

Hypergolic propellants are used in the core liquid-propellant\nstages of the Titan family of launch vehicles, and on the Delta launcher. The Space\nShuttle orbiter uses hypergolic propellants in its orbital manoeuvring subsystem for\norbital insertion, main orbital manoeuvres, and de-orbit. It also uses hypergols in its\nreaction control system for attitude control [10]. The efficiency (in terms of specific\nimpulse) reached in the Space Shuttle by combining monomethyl hydrazine with\nnitrogen tetroxide ranges from 260 to 280 s in the reaction control system, and\nto 313 s in the orbital manoeuvring subsystem, the higher efficiency of the latter\nbeing attributed by NASA [10] to higher expansion ratios in the nozzles and higher\npressures in the combustion chambers.\n\nIn a liquid-propellant rocket, the fuel and the oxidiser are stored in two separate\ncontainers, and are sent to the combustion chamber by means of two separate systems\nof pipes, valves, and pumps. As the sequel will show, a liquid-propellant engine is\nmore complex than a solid-propellant motor, but has several advantages over the latter.\nThis is because the former offers the possibility of controlling the flow of propellant\ntowards the combustion chamber, thereby permitting of throttling, stopping, or re-\nstarting the engine.\n\nThe liquid propellants are introduced into the combustion chamber at the injecting\nplane with a small axial velocity, vj,;, which is assumed to be equal to zero in the\npresent calculation. The combustion proceeds throughout the length of the combus-\ntion chamber, and is presumed to be complete at the inlet plane of the nozzle. The\ndensity of the gas decreases from one section of the combustion chamber to the other,\ndue to the heat of combustion released between these sections. Since the mass flow\nrate remains constant, the gas accelerates toward the inlet section of the nozzle, and\nits pressure decreases.\n\nIn practice, the gas flow within the combustion chamber is not entirely isentropic,\nthat is, the expansion process within the combustion chamber is neither fully irre-\nversible nor fully adiabatic. The stagnation temperature, T,, remains nearly constant,\nbut the stagnation pressure, p,, decreases. This causes an energy loss, which depends\non the specific heat ratio, y, of the gas, and also on the nozzle contraction area ratio,\nA,/A,, where A, is the area of the cross-section of the combustion chamber, and A;\nis the area of the cross-section of the throat. The energy loss occurs where the accel-\neration of gases is affected by expansion due to heat release, as is the case in the\ncombustion chamber, rather than by a change of area, as is the case in the nozzle.\nThe greater the acceleration of the gas flow given by the nozzle, the more efficient\nthe process is.\n\nThe following figure, adapted from [16], shows the static pressure p, the temper-\nature T, and the velocity v of a gas flowing from the inlet plane to the exit plane of a\nconverging-diverging nozzle.\n",

A typical value of 0.31 is indicated\nby Huzel and Huang [4] for a thrust chamber having a contraction area ratio, A;/A;,\nequal to 2 and a gas having a specific heat ratio, y, equal to 1.2.\n\nIn this manner, a combustion chamber performs efficiently its function of\nconverting a propellant into a gas of high temperature and pressure through combus-\ntion. This gas is then accelerated within the nozzle, as will be shown below. The\nnozzles used in rocket engines are of the converging-diverging (de Laval) type, as\nhas been shown in Sect. 1.1. In a nozzle of this type, the area of the cross-section\ndecreases and reaches its minimum value at the throat. Downstream of the throat, this\narea increases to the exit plane of the nozzle. The velocity of the gas flow increases,\nreaches the sonic value at the throat, and then increases further to supersonic values\nin the diverging portion of the nozzle.\n\nAs has been shown in Sect. 1.1, the gas flow through the nozzle is assumed to be an\nisentropic expansion. The total temperature and the total pressure of the gas are also\nassumed to remain constant throughout the nozzle. In these conditions, the pressure\nratio, P;/(P-)ns, between the static pressure at the throat and the total pressure in the\ncombustion chamber at the nozzle inlet is the critical pressure ratio, which depends\nonly on the specific heat ratio, y, as follows\n\nPr 2 wa\n(Pons (; + i)\nwhich results from the energy equation. The sonic velocity (M, = 1) of the gas flow\nis reached in the throat independently of whether the value of the ambient pressure\n(po) at the exit plane of the nozzle be, or be not, less than the value of the gas pressure\nat the throat.\n\nIn case of an ideal expansion (po = p-), the pressure of the gas flowing in the\ndiverging portion of the nozzle continues to decrease, as shown in the preceding\nfigure. Otherwise, an increase in pressure occurs in the diverging portion of the nozzle.\nThis increase in pressure may take place either by isentropic subsonic deceleration\nof the gas flow, or by non-isentropic discontinuities (called shock waves), or by a\ncombination of both of these manners.\n\nAn example of shock waves in a gas flow is shown in the following figure, which\nis due to the courtesy of NASA [17].\n",

They are due to the formation of\nshock waves in the exhaust plume of the three main engines. The exhaust gas (H20)\nflowing from the engines reaches the speed of Mach 10, and the increase in pressure\nresults in the shock diamonds.\n\nLower values of pressure than that of the ambient pressure (pp) can be reached in\nthe diverging portion of a nozzle, where the exhaust gas flows at supersonic speed.\nThe higher ambient pressure cannot advance upstream of the nozzle, because the gas\nflows at supersonic speed.

The present paragraph deals specifically\nwith liquid propellants. They may be classified into the following categories:\ne mono-propellants;\ne bi-propellants;\n\u00a9 cryogenic propellants; and\ne storable propellants.\n\nA mono-propellant is either a mixture of a fuel with an oxidiser, or a single\nsubstance which decomposes into a hot gas in a thrust chamber, in the presence of an\nappropriate catalyst. This chemical decomposition releases thermal energy, which is\ncontained within the chemical bonds of the molecules involved in the reaction. For\nexample, hydrogen peroxide (H,O02) decomposes into hot water vapour (H,O) and\ngaseous oxygen (O2) when made to pass through a platinum catalyst mesh, according\nto the following reaction:\n\n2H202 \u2014 2H20 + O\n",

A gaseous mono-propellant, which can be used instead of hydrogen peroxide,\nis nitrous oxide (NjO).

Further information on this type of mono-\npropellant can be found, for example, in [20].\n\n7 Main Injector Catalyst Nozzle\nTank containing the valve bed\npressurised fluid\n\nThe most widely used mono-propellant is hydrazine (anhydrous N>Hy, also\nwritten HyNNHz), which is a strong reducer, that is, a substance which donates elec-\ntrons to another substance in a redox chemical reaction. In a mono-propellant engine,\nhydrazine decomposes (in the presence of a catalyst such as iridium metal supported\nby high-surface-area alumina, or carbon nanofibres, or molybdenum nitride on\nalumina) into gaseous nitrogen (Nz) and gaseous hydrogen (Hz), or into ammonia\n(NHs3) and gaseous nitrogen (N2), according to the following exothermic reactions\n[21]:\n\nH)NNH2 \u2014 N2 + 2H2\n3H2NNH > 4NH3 + N2\n\nA scheme illustrating a mono-propellant rocket engine fed by hydrazine is shown\nin the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [22].\n",

An electric solenoid valve, placed\nbetween the hydrazine tank and the thrust chamber, opens in order to allow liquid\nhydrazine, in a pulsed or continuous flow, to reach the injector. This hydrazine enters\nthe thrust chamber as a spray and gets in touch with the catalyst bed. This bed\nconsists of alumina (Al,O3) pellets impregnated with iridium. The catalyst bed and\nthe hot gases leaving the catalyst particles cause the liquid hydrazine to vaporise,\nand its temperature to rise to a point where the chemical reaction of dissociation is\nself-sustaining. Then, the gases resulting from hydrazine decomposition leave the\ncatalyst bed and exit from the chamber through a nozzle of high expansion ratio to\nproduce thrust.\n\nMono-propellant hydrazine engines produce a specific impulse of about 230-\n240 s. Mono-propellant engines using hydrogen peroxide and nitrous oxide have a\nlower performance than that obtained with hydrazine, since their specific impulses\nare respectively about 150 and 170 s [10].\n\nSince hydrazine is corrosive, highly toxic and carcinogenic, and is also dangerous\nto handle and store, then new substances, called green propellants, are being studied\nand tested for its replacement. A green propellant is an aqueous solution of a high-\nenergy oxidiser (such as hydroxyl ammonium nitrate, ammonium dinitramide, and\nothers) and a fuel (such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and others). Hydroxyl ammo-\nnium nitrate, also known as HAN, whose chemical formula is NH3OHNO;, is a salt\nderived from hydroxyl amine (NH2OH) and nitric acid (HNO3), which can be used\nas a solution in mono-propellants, or also as a solid oxidiser in bi-propellants. The\nAir Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA, has\ndeveloped a hydroxyl ammonium nitrate-based propellant known as AF-M315E.\nThis propellant is less toxic and easier to handle than hydrazine, and has a specific\n",

It requires a catalyst bed preheating at a temperature\nexceeding 558 K to be ready for general operation [23].\n\nAmmonium dinitramide, also known as ADN, whose chemical formula is\nNH,4N(NO>})o, is the ammonium (NH4*) salt of the dinitraminic acid (HN(NO2)2),\nand was invented in the 1970s in the former Soviet Union and independently\ninvented again in 1989 in the United States by SRI International. Gaseous ammonium\ndinitramide decomposes under heat into ammonia (NH3;), nitrous oxide (NO), and\nnitric acid (HNO3), according to the following two-branch reaction [24]:\n\nNHgN(NO?), \u2014 NH3 + HN(NO?),\n\u2014 NH; + N2,0 + HNO3\n\nThe Swedish company EURENCO Bofors produces a liquid mono-propellant,\ncalled LMP-103S, as a substitute for hydrazine by dissolving 65% ammonium\ndinitramide in 35% water solution of methanol (CH3;0H) and ammonia (NH3).\nLMP-103S has 6% higher specific impulse and 30% higher impulse density (see\nbelow) than hydrazine mono-propellant [25]. LMP-103S has been tested on the\nPRISMA (Prototype Research Instruments and Space Mission technology Advance-\nment, COSPAR designation 2010-028B and 2010-028F) mission in 2010. Rocket\nengines using mono-propellants are simple, require only one tank for the propellant,\nand can be readily turned on and off. They are mainly used to perform such functions\nas orbit maintenance and attitude control of satellites.\n\nA liquid bi-propellant comprises two substances, namely a fuel and an oxidiser,\nwhich are held in separate tanks. They are not mixed before being injected into the\ncombustion chamber of a rocket engine. They may be fed to the combustion chamber\neither by pumps or by pressure in the tanks, as shown in the following figure, due to\nthe courtesy of NASA [26]. In a pump-fed engine (left), the liquid fuel (H2) picks\nup heat, as it circulates through the coolant jacket of the thrust chamber, becomes\ngaseous, and drives a turbine. The gas exhausted by the turbine is then injected into\nthe combustion chamber. This arrangement is called the expander cycle. Control in\nthis cycle is achieved by using: (a) the turbine valve to regulate the thrust, and (b) the\nmixture valve to maintain the desired mixture ratio. In a pressure-fed engine (right),\nthe pressure in the propellant tanks is sufficient to force the two propellants (Hz and\nO>) through the injector into the combustion chamber. The fuel (H2) first circulates\nthrough the coolant jacket, and is then delivered to the combustion chamber. In a\npressure-fed engine, the pressures in the supply tanks can be regulated to yield the\ndesired pressure and mixture ratio in the combustion chamber [26].\n",

In addi-\ntion, the former are often easier to operate than the latter, particularly in consideration\nof the risks connected with the use of hydrazine.\n\nWhen the fuel and the oxidiser react spontaneously, as is the case with the hyper-\ngolic substances described in Sect. 1.2, then no ignition device is needed in a liquid-\npropellant engine. Otherwise, an ignition device is necessary in the combustion\nchamber of a bi-propellant rocket engine. Some of these devices are briefly described\nbelow. One of them is a spark plug igniter. A spark plug igniter is a small combus-\ntion chamber having two spark plugs. It provides the flame to ignite the propellant\n(fuel and oxidiser) in the main thrust chamber. When the engine is started, the spark\nexciters energise the spark plugs as the oxidiser and the fuel flow to the spark igniter.\nAs the gaseous oxidiser and fuel enter this small combustion chamber, they mix and\nare touched off by an electrical spark. The pilot flame provided by the spark igniter\nlights off the main combustion chamber. A spark plug igniter is capable of multiple\nre-ignitions.\n\nThe Rocketdyne J-2 rocket engine had a particular spark plug igniter unit, called\naugmented spark igniter or spark torch igniter, which formed an integral part of the\nthrust chamber injector, as shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy\nof the United States Air Force [27].\n",

Each of these materials, in turn,\ncomprises an oxidiser (usually potassium perchlorate or potassium nitrate) and a\nfuel (usually titanium, or titanium hydride, or zirconium, or zirconium hydride, or\nboron). Such materials, when ignited by the hot wire, generate sparks and hot gases\ndue to the chemical reaction between the oxidiser and the fuel. These, in turn, ignite\nthe mixture of gaseous propellant in the combustion chamber. Pyrotechnic igniters\nare safe and reliable. They are one-shot devices, and therefore cannot be used to\nre-start a rocket engine [30].\n\nStill another ignition method used for liquid propellants consists in injecting some\nspontaneously ignitable fluid, called a pyrophoric fluid, ahead of the propellant.\nPyrophoric substances (for example, ferrous sulphide and many reactive metals)\nhave the property of igniting spontaneously, that is, without an external source of\nheat, upon exposure to air, moisture in the air, oxygen, or water. Such substances may\nbe solid, liquid, or gaseous. Most of them are metals and react spontaneously with\noxygen only when they are in a very finely divided state. Pyrophoric substances are a\nspecial class of hypergolic substances (described in Sect. 1.2), because the oxidising\nagent for the former class is restricted to atmospheric oxygen [31]. They can be\nhandled safely in atmospheres of argon or, with a few exceptions, nitrogen. A list of\npyrophoric materials can be found in [32]. These three methods of ignition (electric\nspark, chemical injection, and pyrotechnic) are shown together in the following\nfigure, due to the courtesy of NASA [33].\n",

The hot\ngas produced, in turn, ignites the propellant in the main combustion chamber.\n\nFundamental concepts on cryogenic propellants have been given in Sect. 1.2. The\nscope of cryogenics has been defined by NASA ([34], page 1) as follows: \u201cCryogenics\nis the discipline that involves the properties and use of materials at extremely low\ntemperatures; it includes the production, storage, and use of cryogenic fluids. A gas\nis considered to be cryogenic if it can be changed to a liquid by the removal of heat\nand by subsequent temperature reduction to a very low value. The temperature range\nthat is of interest in cryogenics is not defined precisely; however, most researchers\nconsider a gas to be cryogenic if it can be liquefied at or below \u2014240 \u00b0F. The most\ncommon cryogenic fluids are air, argon, helium, hydrogen, methane, neon, nitrogen,\nand oxygen. Other gases that are being used in space probes and high-energy liquid-\npropellant rockets include fluorine and nitrogen trifluoride.\u201d. In accordance with\nthe preceding definition, by cryogenic propellants we mean gases which can be\nliquefied at or below 122 K. The most common cryogenic propellants for rocket\napplications are liquid oxygen (Oz), liquid hydrogen (Hz), liquid fluorine (F2), and\noxygen difluoride (OF2), or mixtures of some of these substances.\n\nThese propellants should be stored and handled in such a way as to reduce the\nincrease in their temperature of storage to a minimum. This temperature depends\non the particular propellant and also on the time of storage. The thermal insulation\ntechniques used for reservoirs should reduce the increase in temperature. The gases\ndeveloped from the evaporating liquids should have a venting system, in order to\nallow them to escape. Accurate control should be exerted on the environmental\nhumidity. In addition, the design adopted and the materials selected for rocket engines\nusing cryogenic propellants should take account of the properties of such propellants.\nThese disadvantages are offset by high values of specific impulse, as has been shown\nin Sect. 1.2.\n\nIn contrast with cryogenic liquid propellants, storable liquid propellants are stable\nover a wide range of temperature and pressure, and are also scarcely reactive with\nthe materials used for their reservoirs. Therefore, they can be stored for periods of\n",
    "55": "1.4 Liquid Propellants for High-Thrust Rocket Engines 47\na year or more. These properties make them readily available and reliable. They are\nused in military vehicles and in upper stages of space vehicles.\n\nFor example, a liquid storable fuel is Aerozine 50 (see Sect. 1.2), which is a 50/50\nmixture by weight of hydrazine (H2NNH>) and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine\n(H2NN(CH3)2). Aerozine 50 is used with nitrogen tetroxide (NOx) as the oxidiser,\nwith which it is hypergolic. This combination of fuel and oxidiser is storable at\nroom temperature, and therefore a loaded missile can be stored for several years\nwithout the maintenance requirements associated with cryogenic propellants. This\nfuel was developed in 1950s by Aerojet General Corporation for the Titan Il ICBM\nrocket engines, and has been used in Aerojet\u2019s Titan liquid rocket engine [35] and\nDelta II stage 2 engine [36]. Aerozine 50 is mainly used for interplanetary probes\nand spacecraft propulsion, and is also used for intercontinental ballistic missiles,\nwhich require long-term storage and launch on short notice. Another liquid storable\nfuel, also used with nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as the oxidiser, is UH 24, which\nis a mixture of 75% unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H2NN(CH3)2) and 25%\nhydrazine hydrate (HyNNH> - H2O). This combination is also hypergolic, and has\nbeen used in the Ariane rocket versions 2 through 4 [37], and also in the Indian\nGeosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III [38].\n\nThe liquid propellants indicated above are sometimes mixed with additive\nsubstances, which are meant to either facilitate ignition, or stabilise combustion,\nor reduce corrosive effects, or lower freezing point, or improve cooling properties of\npropellants. Some attempts have been made to promote hypergolicity in propellants\nby adding substances in the cryogenic oxidiser or in the fuel. An account on these\nattempts has been given by Clark [39].\n\nIn particular, it has been proposed to add aluminium tri-ethyl (Alo(C2Hs)\u00a2) to the\nfuel, or ozone fluoride (03F>) to the oxidiser. According to Dickinson [40], using\nhypergolic additives to fuels is not a good practice, because it increases the danger\nof inadvertent ignition on exposure of the fuel to air. The additive might be injected\nas a secondary stream in the fuel ahead of the combustion chamber, but this would\nimply an added complication in the design of a rocket engine. It seems better to mix\nadditives to the oxidiser, because the danger is confined to direct mixing of fluid with\noxidiser, or to direct spilling of the oxidiser on combustible materials.\n\nAs has been shown in Sect. 1.2, there is a mixture ratio (o/f), called the stoichio-\nmetric mixture ratio, between the oxidiser (0) and the fuel (f). The stoichiometric\nmixture ratio for a rocket engine is the ideal ratio of oxidiser to fuel that burns all fuel\nwith no excess oxidiser. In practice, there is another mixture ratio, called the optimum\nmixture ratio, between the oxidiser and the fuel which leads to the maximum value of\nperformance. The optimum mixture ratio is less than the stoichiometric mixture ratio,\nbecause the temperature of the flame reaches its maximum value when the quantity\nof fuel exceeds the value defined by the stoichiometric mixture ratio. This happens\nbecause a combustion richer in fuel generates an exhaust gas having a lower molar\nmass. The optimum mixture ratio varies slightly with the pressure in the combustion\nchamber. In practice, the actual value chosen for the mixture ratio may differ from\nthe optimum value, because the temperature of the combustion chamber must be\n",

By contrast, a high-density\npropellant can be stored in small tanks and requires small pumps to be fed to the\ncombustion chamber. This indicator of performance of a propellant combination is\ntaken into account by means of the so-called impulse density, J,, which is defined\nas follows [6]:\n\nTq = 155av\n\nwhere 6,, is a dimensionless quantity, called average specific gravity of a propellant\n\ncombination (oxidiser and fuel), defined as follows\n\ns.= 5.571 +1)\nav\u2014~\u2014 eet\u201d\nrd\u00a2 + 8o\n\nr = o/f is the oxidiser-to-fuel weight mixture ratio, 5, is the specific gravity (ratio\nof the density of a given substance to the density of water at 277 K and atmospheric\npressure) of the oxidiser, and 6, is the specific gravity of the fuel. Since dy, is a\ndimensionless quantity, then the impulse density, Jy, of a propellant combination\nis measured in seconds, as is the case with the specific impulse, /,. Specific gravi-\nties of various propellants as a function of temperature are given in [6], page 243.\nValues of J, and Jy for various propellants are given in [4], pages 25, 26, and 27.\nFurther performance data, in terms of J, and Jy, concerning liquid hydrocarbons and\naluminium-hydrocarbon fuels, are given in [41], pages 5, 6, and 8.\n\nA propellant combination for a specific application is chosen taking into account\nthe advantages and the disadvantages of each combination. It is often necessary to\nadopt a compromise. Some criteria to be considered in a choice have been identified\nby Huzel and Huang [4]. They are:\n\ne high release of energy per unit mass of propellant, combined with low molar mass\nof the gases resulting from combustion or decomposition, in order to have high\nvalues of specific impulse;\n\n\u00a2 easiness of igniting the propellant;\n\n\u00a2 stability of combustion;\n\ne high density of the propellant or high impulse density, in order to reduce the\nvolume and the weight of the tanks and the pumps;\n\ne capability possessed by the propellant of cooling effectively the thrust chamber;\n\ne low vapour pressure of the propellant a temperature of about 344 K, for low weight\nof tanks and pumps;\n\ne low freezing point of the propellant, possibly less than 219 K, for easy engine\noperation at low temperatures;\n",

The propellants are in the form of liquid\njets. These jets are made to break up into small droplets, which then vaporise at high\ntemperature in the combustion chamber. The breakup of the jets is often achieved\nby causing two or three of like (or sometimes unlike) substances to impinge. The\nimpinging jets produce thin liquid sheets or fans which disintegrate rapidly. In bi-\npropellant engines, the reactive vapours containing fuel and oxidiser get mixed one\nwith the other. The mixed vapours interact, and the hot gases resulting from the\ncombustion process flow out of the combustion chamber toward the throat of the\nnozzle. Due to various reasons, the actual combustion process in steady state may\nbe more complex than the ideal process described above, as shown in the following\nfigure, due to the courtesy of NASA [42].\n\nA reason is the internal shape of some injectors, which are designed so that the\nliquid propellants flowing through them are partially or totally mixed, or broken up\ninto droplets, or vaporised before entering the combustion chamber. This effect can\nalso be obtained by injecting controlled streams of gases into the injector passages,\nor by using other means.\n\nAnother reason is the occurrence of combustion reactions in condensed phase\nwith certain propellants, before their mixture or vaporisation.\n\nStill another reason is the occurrence of heterogeneous reactions in the absence\nof mixing in liquid phase, as is the case with some combinations of hypergolic\npropellants.\n\nStill another reason is an incomplete mixture of fuel with oxidiser in gaseous\nphase. This happens near the walls of the combustion chamber, where fuel-rich\nstreams are intentionally sprayed for purposes of cooling. This also happens because\nof condensed phases which may be present in the mixture of the combustion products,\nwhen the propellants used contain either metals or carbon. This also happens because\npart of combustion products may recirculate back to the vicinity of the injector plate\n",
    "58": "50 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines\nbetween spray fans, instead of going directly toward the nozzle, thereby causing a\nfraction of gas to remain in the combustion chamber for a long time.\n\nStill another reason is the pressure level in the combustion chamber, which may\nincrease above the critical point of one or both of the propellants, thereby causing\nthe sharp distinction between liquid and gas to disappear.\n\nPROPELLENT\nINJECTION\nLIQUID STREAM ATOMIZATION VAPOUR STREAM\nIMPINGEMENT Pd Sosa.

Analytical models of the combustion phenomena\nare described at length in [42, 43].\n\nThe phenomena which occur in a combustion chamber of cylindrical shape can be\ndescribed by dividing the combustion chamber into a series of adjacent cylindrical\n",
    "59": "1.5 Combustion of Propellants in Steady State 51\nsegments, stacked onto one another in the axial direction from the injection plane to\nthe inlet plane of the nozzle. The thickness of each segment, the phenomena which\nactually occur into it, and the shape of its surfaces of separation from the adjacent\nsegments depend on factors such as the specific combination of propellants used,\nthe operating conditions (pressure, temperature, mixture ratio, et c.), and the type\nof injectors. The surfaces which separate two adjacent cylindrical segments are not\nplanar, but have undulations which vary with time.\n\nThe combustion phenomena in a rocket engine depend on the combination of\npropellants used. For example, when the fuel is liquid hydrogen which has been\nused, before injection, to cool the walls of the combustion chamber, then this fuel is\nin the gaseous state at a temperature varying from 60 to 500 K [6]. In such conditions,\nthere are neither droplets of liquid hydrogen nor evaporation.\n\nWhen the liquid propellants used are hypergolic, then an initial chemical reaction\noccurs in liquid phase at the moment in which a droplet of fuel impinges on a droplet\nof oxidiser. Therefore, care must be taken by the designer to avoid local explosions\nand excessive releases of energy which could generate shock waves.\n\nThe cylindrical segment immediately adjacent to the injector plate is known as the\ninjection-and-breakup zone, where two different liquid propellants enter through the\norifices of the injector. This happens with either storable propellants or combinations\nof liquid oxygen with hydrocarbons. The injection velocities range from about 7 to\n60 m/s [6]. The type of injector used (including the pattern, the size, the number,\nand the distribution of the orifices) has a strong influence on the behaviour and in\nparticular on the stability of the combustion in this zone. The same influence have\nthe pressure drop, the configuration of the manifold, or the roughness of the walls of\nthe injection ducts. In this zone, the individual jets or streams of propellants break\nup into droplets by impingement of one jet with another or with a surface, or by\ninherent instability of liquid sprays, or by interactions of liquids with gases having\ndifferent velocities and temperatures. These droplets are heated by radiation coming\nfrom the next zone (called rapid combustion zone) and also by convection of gas in\nthe injection-and-breakup zone. This heat causes the droplets to evaporate and create\nregions rich in either fuel vapour or oxidiser vapour. The injection-and-breakup zone\nis heterogeneous, because it contains liquid propellants, vaporised propellants, and\nhot gases resulting from combustion products. Since the propellants in liquid phase\nare located at discrete places, then large variations are present in mass flow rates,\nmixture ratios, sizes and distributions of droplets, and properties of resulting gases.\nThe chemical reactions occurring in the injection-and-breakup zone generate heat\nat low rates, and hot gases may recirculate back to the injector plate. Such gases\ncreate vortices and turbulent motions which contribute to the initial evaporation\nof the liquids injected. The processes described above occur in a different manner\nwhen one of the propellants is in the gaseous state. Such is the case with gaseous\nhydrogen coming in contact with liquid oxygen. Gaseous hydrogen has no droplets\nand does not evaporate. Since the injection velocity of gaseous hydrogen is much\nhigher (above 120 m/s, according to [6]) than that of liquid oxygen, then shear forces\nact on the liquid jets, and such forces foster the formation and the evaporation of\ndroplets. This case requires the use of an injector of a particular type, which differs\n",

Consequently, fuel-rich and\nfuel-lean gases are mixed. The oxidation of the fuel occurs rapidly in this zone,\nand generates heat at higher rates than those of the preceding zone, with consequent\ndecrease in density and increase in velocity of the burning gas.

The heat release per unit volume is about 3.7 x 10\u00b0 J/m3, which value is\nmuch higher than in a turbojet. In addition, the higher temperatures reached in the\ncombustion chamber of a rocket engine cause chemical reactions to occur at much\nhigher rates than in a turbojet [6].\n\n1.6 Combustion of Propellants in Unsteady State\n\nTransients can be induced in the process of combustion either intentionally, as is the\ncase with engine start-up or shut-down, or because of the insurgence of undesired\nphenomena of instability.\n\nAs will be shown at length in Chap. 2, the combustion chamber of a liquid-\npropellant rocket engine is normally designed to operate in steady state or in condi-\ntions which vary slowly with time. However, an unstable behaviour may occur there\nas a result of small perturbations, which cause self-sustaining oscillations of pres-\nsure in the burning gas. The frequencies of these oscillations vary in a wide range.\nSpecifically, frequencies going from less than 100 Hz to over 15,000 Hz have been\nmeasured in the combustion chamber at amplitudes going from 10 to 1000% of the\npressure in steady state [42].\n\nAccording to Culick and Kuentzmann [43], the energy taken by these oscillations\nis only a small part of the chemical energy made available by the propellants. There-\nfore, except in very severe instances, the mean thrust or the steady power of the engine\nis not affected by the oscillations. However, serious problems may arise because of\nstructural vibrations excited by the oscillating pressure in the combustion chamber,\nand also because of oscillations of the thrust generated by the engine. In addition,\nthe heat transfer rates between the hot gas and the internal surface of the combustion\nchamber can be highly increased, with consequent erosion of the chamber wall.\n\nThe unstable motion of the hot gas is self-excited as a result of an interaction of the\ncombustion process with the structural modes of the rocket vehicle. This instability\narises because a very small part of the chemical energy contained in the propellants is\nsufficient to produce large unsteady motions, and also because the processes tending\nto attenuate such motions are weak, unless appropriate steps are taken.\n\nAn example of these self-sustained oscillations is provided by the so-called pogo\ninstability (see Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9, and Chap. 7, Sect. 7.6), which occurs in the feed\nlines of large liquid-propellant rocket vehicles, such as space launch vehicles or\nballistic missiles. This particular instability is due to a feedback interaction between\n",
    "62": "54 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines\nthe propulsion system and the structure of a rocket stage, and occurs principally in\nthe first longitudinal mode of the structure of the vehicle during operation of its first\nstage.\n\nThe most destructive type of combustion instability is characterised by oscillations\nof high frequency, and is also known as acoustic instability. The frequencies of these\noscillations are equal to or greater than 1000 Hz [4].\n\nThe term acoustic instability is due to an observed correspondence, in both\nfrequency and phase, between the pressure oscillations observed experimentally in\na combustion chamber and the oscillations calculated for the acoustic resonance of\nthe chamber. High-frequency instability includes both longitudinal and transverse\nmodes, and the latter include, in turn, radial and tangential modes.\n\nIn general terms, a source of oscillating energy is necessary to sustain instability.\nIn the particular case of high-frequency instability, the source of oscillating energy\nis the combustion of the propellants used in a rocket engine, and depends weakly on\nthe feed system of the engine. The oscillating energy must, to sustain instability, be\nproperly phased in time with the oscillating pressure, as will be shown at length in\nChap. 2, Sect. 2.9.\n\nSustaining mechanisms which have been proposed for high-frequency instability\ninclude loss of ignition, sensitive chemical preparation time, physical time delays,\ndetonation processes, pressure or temperature sensitive chemical kinetics, the burst\nof droplets heated beyond their critical temperature and pressure, and the shattering\nand mixing of the streams, fans, or drops by the motion of gas particles [42].\n\nInstability in a combustion chamber may start either spontaneously or as a result\nof some artificial perturbation. Acoustic instability may have a threshold amplitude,\nabove which a perturbation is sustained and below which the same perturbation is\ndamped. A rocket engine is said to be inherently stable, when it can absorb large\nperturbations and yet return to its operation in steady state. The degree of inherent\nstability of a rocket engine can be measured by rating devices which provide artificial\nperturbations to its combustion chamber. Such perturbations involve operating condi-\ntions, such as mixture ratio of the propellants, pressure in the combustion chamber,\ntemperature of the fuel, and so on.\n\nAn instability of the spontaneous type requires no initial perturbation to start,\nand grows out of the noise inherent to the combustion process. An instability of\nthis type can be expected to occur just after an engine has reached its normal oper-\nating conditions, because no perturbation is required for its occurrence. Variations\nin test conditions and the closeness to a stability boundary may sometimes delay the\noccurrence of a spontaneous instability.\n\nInstability in a combustion chamber may also be induced by natural or artificial\nperturbations which may occur in the combustion process. Such perturbations are\nalso known as spikes or pops, where a spike indicates a significant overpressure in\nthe combustion chamber upon ignition of the engine, and a pop indicates a similar\noverpressure occurring spontaneously during engine operation at nominal pressure\nin the combustion chamber. For example, at high altitudes, some combinations of\nhypergolic bi-propellants may start with an extremely high spike of pressure in the\ncombustion chamber. This spike has been attributed to the explosion or deflagration\n",
    "63": "1.6 Combustion of Propellants in Unsteady State 55\nof the propellants collected in the combustion chamber or accumulated on its walls\nduring the period of ignition delay. This spike of pressure may be of sufficient magni-\ntude to either cause destructive failure in the combustion chamber or adversely affect\nthe guidance sensor systems. In addition, for small rocket engines used for intermit-\ntent operation, the resultant thrust or the total impulse is seriously altered from that\nof a smooth start. For large engines, the ignition spike can trigger resonance in the\ncombustion process, with consequent hardware destruction [42].\n\nIn most cases, the combustion process in a rocket engine shows a non-linear\nbehaviour, which requires some kind of trigger, be it natural or artificial, to cause\npressure oscillations of high frequency and amplitude in the combustion chamber.\nConsequently, it is necessary to determine the types and the magnitudes of the triggers\nwhich may occur in an engine during flight. This done, it is also necessary to evaluate\nthe stability of that engine with artificial triggers of the assumed types. However,\nas has been shown above, a pressure oscillation may in some cases grow out of\ncombustion noise, in the absence of any observable trigger.\n\nThe dynamic stability of a rocket engine is concerned with the responses of the\nengine to transients occurring during its operation. A rocket engine must, to be\ndynamically stable, return to its normal operating conditions after transients of any\ntype which may occur to it. In other words, in order for a rocket engine to be dynam-\nically stable, the transients resulting from any type of operating conditions must die\nout, or the amplitudes of the subsequent sustained oscillations of pressure must be\nsufficiently small. In order to evaluate the dynamic stability of a rocket engine, the\nengine is driven by any means into pressure oscillations of high amplitude. If these\noscillations subsequently decay to those proper to steady-state conditions, then there\nis sufficient assurance that no oscillations of high amplitude exist within the range\nof the given perturbations. A rocket engine, which has shown a dynamically stable\nbehaviour within the range of the operating conditions expected in flight, should also\nremain stable in actual flight.\n\nAnother method which may be used to gain confidence in the stability of a rocket\nengine consists in conducting a large number of tests and flight. A confidence gained\nin this way is called statistical stability. This confidence indicates only that instability\nhas rarely or never occurred in the operating condition tested, but not that instability\ncan never occur.\n\nAs will be shown at length in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9, the problem of assuring a stable\ncombustion in an existing rocket engine (without changing the dimensions of the\ncombustion chamber, the hydraulic resistances of the propellant feed system, the type\nof injector, the heat flux in the combustion chamber, and the engine performance) can\nbe solved by using baffles, which are simple damping devices. Baffles can be mounted\non existing injectors, in order to solve the stability problem with minimum effort and\ntime. The early injectors had baffles consisting of an even number of blades extending\nradially from a central hub. Later on, baffles have been used in conjunction with\ninjectors having larger orifices in order to gain stability by modifying the combustion\nprocess [42].\n\nAttempts made so far to induce artificial pressure perturbations in the combustion\nchamber of a rocket engine have used pulses of very short duration and sufficient\n",

Three types of techniques have been used to\ntest the stability of combustion in a rocket engine. They are the inert gas (nitrogen\nor helium) pulse, the pulse gun, and the non-directional bomb.\n\nThe first technique acts as a velocity perturbation to the combustion process,\nwhereas the pulse gun and the non-directional bomb generate perturbations in both\npressure and velocity by using explosives. Therefore, the resulting perturbation is\nof the triggered (or induced) type. A gas pulse has been used in engines burning\nliquid oxygen and RP-1. For such engines, this technique has been found effective\nin producing perturbations triggering sustained instability. A gas pulse has also been\nused in engines burning nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozine 50 with negligible effects\non the combustion.\n\nA pulse gun is a device which resembles a gun. It consists of a breech into which\nan explosive charge is placed, usually in a cartridge case, a firing mechanism, a barrel,\nand often a diaphragm to protect the explosive charge from the environment of the\ncombustion chamber of the engine. The barrel of a pulse gun is usually attached to\nthe wall of the combustion chamber of the engine, in order for the pulse to be fired\nin the tangential direction or in the radial direction. A pulse gun is acted upon by\na command given to its firing mechanism, which is usually a mechanical detonator\nacting on the main charge. The explosive charge of a pulse gun contains a mass of\ngun powder ranging from 194.4 to 259.2 mg, but may also contain a mass as high\nas 6480 mg of high explosive.

Pulse\nguns and non-directional bombs can induce pressure perturbations ranging from 10\nto 500% of the normal value in the combustion chamber.

The injection velocity ranges from about 7 to 60 m/s [2]. The\ndroplets of the two propellants may either mix together in form of a spray or go\nseparately into the combustion chamber.\n\n(2) Then, the high temperature existing in the combustion chamber causes the\ndroplets to vaporise.\n\n(3) Then, the vaporised combination of fuel and oxidiser is further heated and burns\nat its stoichiometric mixture ratio, causing a continuous increase in mass flow\nrate in the combustion chamber. The combustion is aided by the high velocity\nof the molecules within the combustion chamber, and takes place completely\nupstream of the throat plane. Care must be taken by the designer in order for the\ncombustion process to be stable, that is, free from shocks and detonation waves\nin the combustion front.\n\n(4) Finally, the combusted gas flows in the converging portion of the nozzle. The\nvelocity of the gas increases in subsonic conditions (M < 1) and reaches the sonic\nvalue (M = 1) at the throat plane of the nozzle. The subsequent passage through\nthe diverging portion of the nozzle causes the velocity of the gas molecules to\nincrease further in supersonic conditions (M > 1). The combusted gas is then\nejected from the thrust chamber through the exit plane of the nozzle.\n\nThe principal components of a thrust chamber are the injector including the propel-\nlant inlets and distributing manifolds, the ignition device (which is necessary in case\nof a rocket engine burning non-hypergolic propellants), the combustion chamber,\nthe converging portion of the nozzle between the inlet plane and the throat, and the\ndiverging portion of the nozzle between the throat and the exit plane.

The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector\nControl\nThe present paragraph concerns the methods used to control the direction of the\nthrust vector in a rocket or spacecraft. These methods are considered here in view of\ntheir bearing on the design of a thrust chamber, as will be shown below. By thrust\nvector control we mean the ability of a space vehicle to deflect the direction of the\nthrust away (that is, at an angle, 0, other than zero) from the longitudinal axis of the\nvehicle.

Second,\nan intentional change of attitude (or rotation) of the vehicle about one or more of\n",
    "75": "68 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly\nthe principal axes of inertia passing through its centre of mass. Third, a correction\nof either the flight path or the attitude which becomes necessary in order for the\nvehicle to maintain the desired trajectory and orientation. Fourth, a correction of the\nmisalignment between the thrust vector and the gravity force vector. As to the last\nissue, the thrust vector is applied to the nozzle of the vehicle, whereas the gravity\nforce vector is applied to its centre of gravity, as shown in the following figure, due\nto the courtesy of NASA [8].\nLift\nDrag Weight\neu\n\nIn order for the vehicle not to be subject to unwanted torques, the directions of\nthe thrust and weight vectors must be aligned at w radians (180\u00b0). A rocket is also\nsubject, when flying through the atmosphere, to aerodynamic forces (lift and drag),\nwhich are applied to its centre of pressure, not to its centre of gravity, as shown in\nthe preceding figure.\n\nThese forces produce moments about the principal axes of inertia of the vehicle.\nThese moments, in turn, cause the vehicle to rotate about its centre of gravity. For a\nstable flight, the centre of gravity of a rocket must be above its centre of pressure. The\nlongitudinal axis of the rocket, or the line joining the tip of the nose with the centre\nof the exit section of the nozzle, is called the roll axis, and a motion of the rocket\nabout the roll axis is called a rolling motion. The centre of gravity of the rocket lies\nalong the roll axis. The pitch and yaw axes are mutually perpendicular and form a\nplane passing through the centre of gravity and perpendicular to the roll axis. Pitch\nmoments tend to either lower or raise the nose of the rocket. Yaw moments cause the\nnose to move from side to side.\n\nBoth mechanical and aerodynamic methods can be used to re-direct the rocket\nthrust and provide the necessary steering forces. Some of such methods use static fins,\nmovable fins, jet vanes, jetevators, canards, gimballed (that is, swivelled) nozzles,\nVernier rockets, fuel injectors, and attitude-control rockets, as shown in the following\nfigure, due to the courtesy of NASA [9].\n",

These moments oppose the deflection of the\nrocket in the directions of the pitch and yaw axes. Of course, the static fins must be\nso sized as to generate the amount of aerodynamic forces required to counteract the\ndeviations. On the other hand, the fins generate further drag, in the direction opposed\nto the rocket velocity vector. In spite of that, aerodynamic fins, be they fixed or\nmovable, are very effective for controlling a vehicle flying through the atmosphere.\nThey continue to be used in weather rockets, anti-aircraft missiles, and air-to surface\nmissiles.\n\nGenerally speaking, a thrust vector control system used in a rocket may be either\npassive or active. A passive control system is a fixed device meant to stabilise a\nrocket by its very presence on the outside of the rocket. An example of such a device\nis a cluster of fins mounted around the lower end of a rocket, near the nozzle. The\npurpose of the fins is to keep the centre of pressure below the centre of gravity of the\nrocket.\n\nIn order to overcome the disadvantages (higher drag and mass) of the fins, active\ncontrol systems have been developed.

For this purpose, the engine can be\nmounted in a two-axis ring-suspension system, as shown in the following figure,\ndue to the courtesy of NASA [15].

This happens because of the increase in the flow\nvelocity over the curved surface, which causes pressure to decrease. The low pressure\ncauses not only the injected co-flow but also the primary flow to be deflected off the\nnozzle axis toward the divergent wall, as shown in the preceding figure, where the\n",

For this purpose,\nsuction is applied asymmetrically between the trailing edge of a primary nozzle\nand an aft suction collar. This creates a low-pressure region along the suction\ncollar, and causes the primary jet to turn [24). The results found by Strykowski\net al. [23] at Mach 2 show that the thrust loss is less than 4% and the required mass\nflow rates are less than approximately 2% of the primary jet. A co-flow, due to the\nviscous entrainment generated by the primary flow, takes place at the wall of the\nsuction collar, and interferes with the primary flow. By activating asymmetrically\nthis co-flow, the primary flow is deflected towards the side on which the suction\nflow is applied, due to the pressure drop which causes the thrust to turn [22].\ne Throat-shifting for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is performed by injecting\nsecondary flow at or just upstream of the throat, as shown in the following figure.\nBy so doing, there is no formation of shock waves.\n",

The primary flow, when interacting with the oblique shock\nwave, turns away from the axis of symmetry of the nozzle. This turn changes the\ndirection of the thrust vector. By so doing, the direction of the primary flow does\nnot change in the vicinity of the throat.

Another disadvantage of the fluidic thrust vectoring methods has been\nfound in their need for a source of secondary flow. In the event of that source being\nthe same as that of the primary flow which generates the thrust, it has been argued,\nthe performance of the vehicle would decrease, at least in the phase of thrust vector\ncontrol. As to the loss in performance, Strykowski et al. [23] have found, at Mach\n2, a thrust loss lower than 4%, with the required mass flow rates being lower than\napproximately 2% of the primary jet.

The semi-aperture angle a of the\ndiverging portion of the nozzle varies from about 7/15 rad to 2/10 rad (from 12 to\n18\u00b0) [5].

This type\nof nozzle offers the advantages of decreasing the portion of nozzle where the gas\nflow expands, and changing gradually the local angle of semi-aperture, so as to\nhave a uniform, nearly axially directed flow at the exit plane. In addition, since\nthe slope of the wall contour changes continuously, then the formation of oblique\nshocks is avoided. The optimum contour for a bell-shaped nozzle which leads to the\nmaximum magnitude of thrust has been determined in 1958 by Rao [30], by using the\nmethod of characteristics combined with the calculus of variations. Several computer\nprogrammes have subsequently been developed (see, for example, 32) in order to\ndetermine the optimum contour by applying the method described by Rao [30]. In\npractice, an equivalent conical nozzle having a semi-aperture angle a = 2/12 ~\n0.2618 rad = 15\u00b0 is used as a standard to specify the length of a bell-shaped nozzle.\nFor example, a bell-shaped nozzle is said to have a fractional length Ly = n% when\nits true length L,,, measured from the throat plane to the exit plane, is\n\nL,= wma -1+ 13( a6 - \u2018)]\n100 tan 0.2618 cos 0.2618\nthat is, when the true length L,, of that nozzle is n/100 times the length of a conical\nnozzle having a semi-aperture angle w = 2/12 rad = 15\u00b0, the same radius R, at the\nthroat plane, and the same expansion ratio \u00a2 = A,/A,. It has been proved experi-\nmentally that a bell-shaped nozzle whose fractional length Ly is greater than about\n85% does not offer substantial advantages for the purpose of increasing the nozzle\ncorrection factor A, because an increase in length implies an increase in mass.

The exhaust\ngas is free to expand on the open sides of the nozzle, and to adjust its static pressure\nwith the static pressure of the ambient, which decreases with altitude. Thus, a nozzle\nof very high area ratio (of high performance in vacuo) can also operate efficiently\nand safely at sea level.\n\nBy contrast, a bell-shaped nozzle can be designed to be optimum (that is, to\noperate at its maximum level of efficiency) at only one altitude. By maximum level\nof efficiency, we mean the optimal expansion of the combusted gas, which results in\nthe maximum thrust. For example, the initial stage of the Saturn rocket, which carried\nthe Apollo astronauts to the Moon, had a narrow bell-shaped nozzle to produce an\nideal straight-edged column of exhaust gas at sea level. However, the command\nmodule, which orbited around the Moon, had a much wider bell-shaped nozzle,\nwhich was better suited than the nozzle of the initial stage to the expansion of the\ncombusted gas in the vacuum of space.\n\nAs shown above, in an aerospike nozzle, the static pressure (p,) of the exhaust gas\nis the same as the static pressure (po) of the ambient, and therefore the term A.(p. \u2014\nPo) in the equation of thrust (see Chap. 1, Sect. 1.1):\n\nF = myve + Ac(Pe \u2014 Po)\nreduces to zero. In addition, an aerospike engine may also be made of individual\nthruster segments, which can be turned on or off to provide thrust vector control in\norder to steer the vehicle [37], instead of using one of the techniques described in\nSect. 2.2.\n\nAn aerospike rocket engine was developed by Rockwell Aerospace/Rocketdyne\nDivision of Canoga Park, California. In the 1960s, Rocketdyne developed a rounded\naerospike engine, whose thrust chamber consisted of a truncated annular spike nozzle,\nof the radial in-flow type, and a number of discrete combustion chambers arranged\naround the periphery of the nozzle, so as to discharge their gases along the surface of\nthe nozzle. Subsequently, in 1972, this design gave rise to a linear aerospike engine,\n",

The\nfollowing figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5], illustrates the gas flow, under\naltitude conditions (that is, high value of the pressure ratio p,/po), of a rocket engine\nhaving a toroidal combustion chamber, an annular throat, and a truncated spike nozzle\nending in a circular base.\n",

The primary flow continues\nto expand beyond the base of the nozzle, and gives rise to a subsonic recirculating\nflow in the Region 2 of the same figure. The pressure acting on the base generates\nadditional thrust. By adding a small amount of secondary flow to the recirculating\nflow at the base of the nuzzle, the pressure acting on the base is increased further.\nThere is a limit to this increase in efficiency, which determines the optimum amount\nof secondary flow to be added for each given shape of the nozzle. The outer surface\nof the primary flow is the boundary of a free stream, and therefore depends on the\nambient pressure. This fact provides the property of altitude compensation to the\naerospike nozzle illustrated above.\n\nThe performance of the gas expansion in nozzles of various types can be expressed\nby means of a graph of the thrust coefficient Cr (defined in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.3) versus\nthe pressure ratio p,/po of the static pressure in the combustion chamber p, to the\nambient pressure po. In the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5], we\nconsider the thrust coefficient Cr for: (a) an ideal nozzle of variable expansion area\nratio having the optimum expansion for any value of the pressure ratio p,/po, (b) an\naerospike nozzle of high area ratio, and (c) a bell-shaped nozzle of high area ratio.\nThis graph shows that the dashed line of the aerospike nozzle approximates the solid\nline of the ideal nozzle much better than does the dash-and-dot line of the bell-shaped\nnozzle.\n",

This is because the hot gases contained in a thrust chamber\nreach high temperatures, and also transfer high heat fluxes to the walls.\n\nAs to the values of temperatures and heat fluxes reached in a liquid-propellant\nrocket engine, the opinions of the authors are not unanimous. According to Huzel\nand Huang [5], the combustion temperatures range from 2500 to 3600 K and the\nheat fluxes range from 817 to 82000 kW/m?2. According to Wieseneck [43], the\ncombustion temperatures in oxygen-hydrogen rocket engines (such as J-2, J-2S,\nand M-1) range from 3600 to 4700 K and the heat fluxes range from 28000 to\n",

Wieseneck also cite the case of the engines of the Space Shuttle,\n\nwhere the maximum value of design for the heat flux was 118000 kW/m?. According\n\nto Sutton and Biblarz [2], the combustion temperatures are well above the melting\npoints of the materials of which the walls are made, and the heat fluxes range from\n\n500 to 160000 kW/m?. According to Turner [44], a typical temperature is 3000 K,\n\nbut the melting point of most metals is below 2000 K.\n\nThere are several methods for maintaining the temperatures of the walls at levels\nof safety. Van Huff and Fairchild [45] cite the following methods:\n\ne regenerative cooling, obtained by forcing one or both of the propellants to flow\ninto tubes or channels running longitudinally along the outer surface of the wall\nto be cooled, before being discharged into a special gas generator or directly into\nthe combustion chamber;\n\ne transpiration cooling, obtained by cooling a porous inner wall by means of a\ncooling fluid which is forced to flow through the porous material;\n\ne film cooling, obtained by maintaining a thin layer of cooling fluid over the inner\nsurface of the wall; and\n\n\u00a9 coating, obtained by depositing a layer of low-conductivity material which acts\nas a thermal barrier on the inner side of the wall.\n\nHuzel and Huang [5] add the following methods:\n\ne dump cooling, obtained by feeding a small percentage of propellant (for example,\nhydrogen, in a liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen engine) through passages in the\nwall of the thrust chamber for cooling, and subsequently dumping it overboard\nthrough openings at the rear end of the nozzle skirt;\n\ne ablative cooling, obtained by intentional loss of the inner wall of the thrust\nchamber, whose material (usually fibre-reinforced organic material) is melted\nor vaporised away, in order to dissipate heat and save the material of which the\nouter wall is made; and\n\ne radiation cooling, obtained by radiating heat away from the surface of the outer\nwall of the thrust chamber.\n\nThe choice of one of the methods indicated above depends on the design of the\nthrust chamber. Huzel and Huang [5] suggest some factors to be considered for a\nchoice. They are indicated below.\n\n(a) Propellants used, because their combustion products have properties (such as\ntemperature, specific heat ratio, density, viscosity, etc.) which determine the\nheat fluxes and therefore the cooling requirements.\n\n(b) Pressure in the combustion chamber, whose value also determines the heat flow\nrate. In case of high pressure in the combustion chamber, combined regenerative\nand film cooling methods are frequently used.\n\n(c) Propellant feed system, which determines the values of pressure in the combus-\ntion chamber. For example, in case of a rocket engine fed by turbo-pumps, a\nhigh amount of pressure is available for cooling. This amount can be used for\nregenerative cooling, in order to force the cooling propellant to flow into the\n",

By contrast, a rocket engine fed by\npressurised gas is limited by a low amount of pressure, and therefore works at\na low pressure in the combustion chamber. In the latter case, film, ablative, or\nradiation cooling methods are to be used.\n\n(d) Shape of the combustion chamber, which determines the local mass flow rates\nof combusted gas and the areas of the wall to be cooled.\n\n(e) Materials used in the construction of a thrust chamber. This is because strength\nand heat conductivity at high temperatures are desirable properties in materials\nused for regeneratively cooled thrust chambers. In case of film cooled thrust\nchambers, materials allowing higher working temperatures are necessary for the\npurpose of reducing the heat flow rates and therefore the flow rates of the film\ncoolant. The possibility of using radiative cooling depends on the availability\nof refractory alloys capable of resisting temperatures of 1922 K and more.\nLikewise, the possibility of using ablative cooling depends on the availability\nof reinforced plastic materials.\n\nAs a general rule, the choice of cooling method has a deep influence on the design\nof a thrust chamber, and vice versa.\n\nAn analysis is made below of the heat transfer from the combustion products\ncontained in a thrust chamber and the walls of that chamber. Due to the high velocity\nof the hot gases, the heat transfer occurs through convection, and therefore the heat\npropagates because of the motion of gaseous masses in the thrust chamber. The heat\npasses from the moving gas firstly to the stagnant boundary layer along the wall, and\nthen to the wall itself.\n\nLet g (measured in W/m?) be the quantity of heat per unit time per unit surface\ntransferred across the boundary layer. Let h, (W m-? K~!) be the heat transfer\ncoefficient on the hot gas side. Let T,,, (K) be the temperature of the hot gas at the\nadiabatic wall. The temperature 7 ,,, is assumed to be equal to the total (or stagnation)\ntemperature in the thrust chamber multiplied by a recovery factor (whose value\nranges from 0.90 to 0.98) of the turbulent boundary layer. Let T\\,z (K) be the local\ntemperature of the wall on the hot gas side. The heat transfer through convection is\ngoverned by the following equation\n\nq = Ng (Taw \u2014 Twe)\n\nThe value of the convective heat transfer coefficient hy can be determined by using\n\nthe Bartz equation [46, page 30, Eq. 50], as follows\n0.026 (wep) (Pens \\\u00b0* ( Diy\" | ( Av)?\u201d\nt ns\n\nwhere D, (m) is the diameter of the nozzle in the throat plane, x (N s m~\u201d) is the\n\ncoefficient of dynamic viscosity of the gas, c, (J kg~!

[48, page 911, Eqs. 4 and 5], in case of data on Pr and\n(Ns m7\u201d) not being available for particular mixtures of combusted gas, it is possible\nto determine approximate values by means of the following equations\n\nPr= Ay\noy -\u20145\n= KT? = (1.184 x 10-7) M79\"\nwhere M (kg/kmol) is the molar mass, T (K) is the temperature of the mixture of\ncombusted gas, and the exponent w of T has been taken equal to 0.6.\n\nThe preceding equations give approximate values of the convective heat transfer\ncoefficient h, on the hot gas side. The calculated value of h, may be lower than the\nreal value, because a substantial part of combusted gases may transfer heat through\nradiation, or because a substantial part of gaseous molecules dissociate and then\nrecombine near the wall of the thrust chamber, or because the gas flow is unstable.\nConversely, the calculated value of h, may be higher than the real value, because the\nchemical reactions occurring in the combustion process may be incomplete in the\ncombustion chamber, or because the combusted gases may deposit solid particles,\nwhich in turn create insulating layers on the wall of the chamber. These solid particles\nare made of carbon, in case of a combination of liquid oxygen with RP-1 (kerosene).\nThis carbon layer increases the thermal insulation of the wall on the hot gas side.\n\nIn order to take account of the solid deposit of carbon on the chamber walls in the\ncomputation of the heat transfer, the following equation may be used\n\n4 = hgc(Taw \u2014 Twe)\nwhere lige (W m~?

In order to avoid the\nnecessity of tapering, Volvo Aero Corporation has used tubes of square cross-section,\nwhich are wrapped in a spiral pattern around the inner wall of the nozzle. They are\njoined by gas-tungsten arc fillet welds [63]. Volvo Aero Corporation has also used a\nmanufacturing process which consists in laser welding a close-out cover sheet on to\nan inner wall with milled cooling channels. When the outer sheet is laser welded to\nthe inner sheet, the part has the form of a straight cone. Successively, the forming of\na bell-shaped contour is done by expansion in a conventional expander [64].\n\nAs has been shown above, the dump cooling method is similar to the regenerative\ncooling, because the coolant flows, for both of these methods, through small passages\non the outer side of the thrust chamber. However, in the case of dump cooling, the\ncoolant is discharged overboard through openings at the end plane of the divergent\nportion of the nozzle, instead of flowing back to be discharged into the injector.\nThis method is used in rocket engines fuelled by hydrogen at low pressures (p,. <\n689500 N/m, where Pc is the static absolute pressure in the combustion chamber).\nThe heated hydrogen dumped overboard gives a contribution to the total thrust. The\ncoolant, if flowing longitudinally from the injector plane to the exit plane, can pass\neither in the interstice between a double wall (case A) or in tubes running along a\nsingle wall (case C). The coolant, if flowing spirally from the injector plane to the\nexit plane, can pass either in spiral passages existing between a double wall (case B)\nor in tubes wound around a single wall (case D), before being dumped overboard in\nthe axial direction.

Therefore, in case of need, further coolant is injected through additional holes\nplaced downstream of those placed along the first row. Film cooling is sometimes\nused in conjunction with regenerative cooling, for the purpose of reducing the heat\ntransfer through the wall and, therefore, the thermal stress of the materials.\n\nThe coolant is often in the liquid state at the moment of injection, in order to absorb\nheat from the combusted gas by evaporating and diffusing into the main stream.\nThis injection gives rise to a liquid film placed around the wall of the combustion\nchamber and containing the gaseous stream.

The heat coming from the wall depends on the heat transfer\nhg coefficient on the hot gas side and also on the difference between the temperature\nT ay Of the gas at the adiabatic wall and the initial temperature T., of the coolant. The\nheat absorbed by the coolant depends on the heat capacity of the coolant in the interval\nfrom the initial temperature to the final temperature. When the two amounts of heat\nare in equilibrium, no heat is transferred through the wall. In such conditions, the inner\nsurface of the thrust chamber reaches the temperature of the coolant corresponding\nto the particular location along the flow axis. Therefore, the temperature of the inner\nsurface of the thrust chamber increases from the initial temperature of the coolant at\nthe point of injection to the maximum allowable value of the temperature, at which\npoint a further injection of coolant becomes necessary.\n\nAs an example of application, it is required to determine the mass flow rate G,\n(kg s~! m7) of film coolant per unit area of the wall of the thrust chamber to be\ncooled, for a rocket engine burning a combination of liquid hydrogen (fuel) with\nliquid fluorine (oxidiser).

The porous material used for the walls\nof transpiration-cooled thrust chambers must, of course, withstand the mechanical\nand thermal stresses acting on such walls.\n\nAs has been shown above, ablative cooling is performed by using a protective\nmaterial which covers the inner surface of a wall to be cooled. This material is made\nof either epoxy or, more often, phenolic resins reinforced by fibres. The protective\nmaterial thermally degrades, and the products of this degradation (an endothermal\npyrolysis of the resin, which leaves a pure carbon solid, called char, and releases\noxygen and hydrogen) are carried away by the main stream of hot gas. The process\nof ablation blocks the heat flux to the outer surface of the wall.

One\nof them is the injection velocity v (m/s), which is the velocity at which the oxidiser,\nor the fuel, is injected into the combustion chamber. The injection velocity can be\ndetermined as follows\n\nm\nv= \u2014\nAp\nwhere rit (kg/s) is the mass flow rate of the propellant, A (m7) is the area of the orifices\nof the injector, and p (kg/m*) is the density of the propellant.\n\nAnother factor is the drop of injection pressure Ap; (N/m*), which can be\n\ncalculated as follows\nAy = tof\u201d > 1m \\\nP= SVG) = VAG\nwhere Cy is a dimensionless coefficient of discharge, whose value (usually in the\nrange 0.5 < Cy < 0.92) is determined experimentally by means of water flow tests.\nAn orifice having a well-round entrance and a smooth bore has also a high value of\nCa, and gives rise to a low value of drop of injection pressure, for the same value of\ninjection velocity v.\n",
    "170": "2.6 Injectors 163\nAnother factor is the resultant angle 6 of two impinging streams of propellant.\nWith reference to the following figure, let 7; and 1i2(kg/s) be the mass flow rates\nof two impinging streams.

In these conditions, a positive value of the 8\nangle can generate hot streaks on the wall of the combustion chamber. A negative\nvalue of the B angle should be chosen to avoid this undesirable effect.\n\nAnother factor is the injection momentum ratio, which is defined as follows\n\nMoVo\n\nRy = 2\n\nmo tiapyy\nwhere m,(kg/s) and m (kg/s) are the mass flow rates of respectively the oxidiser\nand the fuel, and v, (m/s) and vy (m/s) are their respective injection velocities.

There are several ways to\nuse the propellants for this purpose. Therefore, there are several arrangements of\ncomponents, which are called rocket engine cycles.

A small amount (about\n3% in the J-2X engine) of the propellants is used to keep the engine running, whereas\nthe remaining part of the propellants is used to generate thrust. A gas generator (GG)\nis a separate, small combustion chamber which produces gases. These gases are\nused to drive the turbines connected to the pumps.

At the exit from the pumps, a small amount of each propellant is tapped off\nto supply the gas generator (GG), which is substantially a small engine included into\nthe principal engine. This small engine generates hot combustion products (which\nare, in the present case, steam and gaseous hydrogen) at high pressure. These gases\nare used to drive first the turbine connected to the fuel pump and then the turbine\nconnected to the oxidiser pump. After driving the two turbines, the hot gases are\nused to warm the helium flowing through the heat exchanger (HEX), which is used\nto pressurise the oxygen tank of the stage, and are then dumped along the walls of\nthe nozzle extension, to keep them cool. The remaining liquid oxygen, which does\nnot go to the gas generator, is directed to the main injector. The hydrogen coming\nfrom the fuel pump is used to regeneratively cool the walls of the nozzle and the\nwalls of the main combustion chamber (MCC), and is then directed to the injector of\nthe main combustion chamber. A very small amount of the warm gaseous hydrogen\nis tapped off before entering the main injector, and is routed back to pressurise the\nhydrogen tank, as is the case with the helium flowing through the heat exchanger\n",

A yoke integral with the piston opens\nthe oxidiser poppet. The cracking pressures relative to the atmosphere are (7.239\n+ 1.379) x 10\u00b0 N/m? for the fuel poppet and (13.79 + 1.379) x 10\u00b0 N/m? for\nthe oxidiser poppet. The fully-open operating pressure relative to the atmosphere is\n(18.96 + 1.724) x 10\u00b0 N/m? for the control valve. The bootstrap propellant mass flow\nrates are 6.133 kg/s for the fuel and 2.091 kg/s for the oxidiser. A bellows assembly\nenclosing the liquid oxygen poppet stem and the closure spring, and the seals on the\nactuator piston prevent leakage of fuel and oxidiser into the control valve actuator. A\ndrain line directs any fuel leakage into the valve actuator to the fuel drain manifold,\nwhere it is dumped overboard into the engine exhaust stream. The control valve is\ndesigned to ensure a fuel-rich cut-off to prevent an excessive increase in temperature\nin the combustor with consequent turbine burning. The spring pressure closes the\ncontrol valve at engine cut-off, when the pressure in the thrust chamber decreases.\n\nThe fuel and the oxidiser from the gas generator control valve enter the injector\nand flow through passages which provide a uniform mixture ratio o/f = 0.3409.\nThe injector cavity is designed to permit an oxidiser lead into the combustor during\nstart to prevent detonation. From the injector, two fuel streams impinge on a single\noxidiser stream. The injector has 44 impingement points. The fuel which enters the\ncombustor through 36 holes around the periphery of the impingements provides film\ncoolant for the injector. During countdown, the oxidiser injector of the gas generator\nreceives a purge with ambient gaseous nitrogen to prevent entrance of contaminants\nfrom the solid-propellant gas generator into the injector.\n\nThe bootstrap propellants burn in the combustor and exit to the gas turbine. Two\nsquib-less igniters installed in the combustor just below the injector of the gas gener-\nator assure propellant ignition during start. The combustor is a welded assembly with\nflanges for installation of the solid-propellant gas generator and for attachment to\nthe gas turbine. The operating temperature is 920.9 + 264.3 K, and the operating\nabsolute pressure is (4.456 + 0.03378) x 10\u00b0 N/m?.\n\nTwo squib-less igniters installed in the injector mounting flange on the combustor\nburn for 2.5\u20143 s after their ignition by the solid-propellant gas generator. They ensure\nignition of fuel and oxidiser if the solid-propellant gas generator should have expired\nbefore bootstrap propellant entry into the combustor.\n\nA gas generator burns the propellants just as the main engine does, the only\ndifference being the capability possessed by the former of varying the mixture ratio\nolf, whose value is adjusted in order for the combusted gas to have the desired\ntemperature and chemical properties.\n\nThe guidelines for designing a gas generator for a liquid bi-propellant rocket\nengine are the same as those relating to the thrust chamber of the main engine. When\nthe characteristic length L* is calculated, the volume to be taken into account goes\nfrom the injector to the throat of the nozzle of the turbine. Account is also taken\nof the maximum temperature which the materials of which the turbine is made can\nwithstand. Consequently, the design temperature of the turbine is usually kept under\n1255 K [5].\n",
    "182": "2.8 Igniters 175\n2.8 Igniters\n\nAn igniter is a device which releases energy (usually in form of heat) in a rocket\nengine, for the purpose of initiating the combustion of the main propellants. This\ncombustion, after initiation, is capable of sustaining itself without the necessity of\nreceiving heat. The source of energy which stimulates an igniter to release heat is\neither inside (as is the case with a solid propellant) or outside (as is the case with a\nspark arrangement) the igniter itself. The principal types of igniters used in rocket\nengines are described below.\n\nPyrotechnic igniters are devices containing mixtures of fuels, oxidants, and often\nother materials. These devices are used in rocket engines (thrust chambers and gas\ngenerators) to release energy in form of heat. Pyrotechnic mixtures are in a state of\nmeta-stability, meaning by this term, stability and non-reactivity under some condi-\ntions, and release of thermal energy originally stored in chemical form after receiving\nan external stimulus, which is usually given to such mixtures by addition of heat.\nThe amount of energy required to stimulate this release of heat is called activation\nenergy. The net amount of thermal energy released in a pyrotechnic reaction is called\nheat of reaction. The heats of reaction for some binary pyrotechnic compositions are\ngiven in [84].

The solid-propellant charge burns with a hot flame within the combustion\nchamber. The igniter can be designed to fit directly onto the injector. This method\nof ignition can only be used once. Therefore, a rocket engine having a pyrotechnic\nigniter cannot be restarted, as has been shown in Sect. 2.1.\n\nThe most effective materials used for output charges in initiators are metal-oxidant\npyrotechnic formulations. Some examples of these formulations are shown in the\nfollowing table, due to the courtesy of NASA [85].\n\n/Designation\nMk 247, Mk 265 Laminac, 5,6%\n(igniters)\n(EBW)\nMB-1 (500-V Nitrocellulose, 1.0%\ninitiator)\nFA.878\n10,\n17)\nM2 squib Egyptian lacquer, 10%\nCharcoal, 18%\n40%\n\nPyrotechnic igniters can be mounted in recesses as plugs of the screw-in type, in\ncase of gas generators and small thrust chambers.\n\nHypergolic igniters are based on the property of some bi-propellant combinations\nwhich ignite spontaneously at room temperature when the two components (the\nfuel and the oxidiser) of a combination get in touch one with the other. Therefore,\nhypergolic combinations do not require an external source of ignition. They need\nonly a valve to mix the fluids for the purpose of initiating the combustion. This\nmethod of ignition reduces the components of an ignition system, and therefore its\nchances of failure.\n\nAs has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.2, the most common fuels used in a combi-\nnation of hypergolic propellants are hydrazine (HyNNH2), monomethyl hydrazine\n(CH3(NH)NHz2), unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H2NN(CH3)2), and Aerozine\n50, the last being an equal mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl\nhydrazine. The oxidisers used in combination with these fuels are usually nitrogen\ntetroxide (N04) and various blends of nitrogen tetroxide with nitric oxide (NO).\n\nHypergolic igniters have been used in liquid bi-propellant engines.

The pre-burner illustrated above is the gas generator which\ndrives the main turbine.\n\nIn order to start the engine, a start tank of spherical shape, shown in the lower part\nof the preceding figure, is connected to both of the fuel lines by means of tubes and\nassociated valves. The start tank is filled with fuel and put under pressure by using gas.\nWhen the valves to the fuel lines and the cartridges are opened, the high pressure of\nthe fuel drives pistons which are in the cartridges. This causes the TEA-TEB mixture\nto be released into the gas generator and into the main combustion chambers, which\nin turn have been filled with oxygen after the liquid oxygen valves are opened, and\nthe tank pressure causes oxygen to enter the engine. The TEA-TEB mixture comes\nin touch with oxygen, and therefore self-ignites and starts the combustion inside the\ngas generator and the main combustion chambers. The combustion is sustained by\nthe fuel entering the gas generator and the main combustion chambers just after the\nTEA-TEB mixture. Now, the gas generator is running, and therefore the main turbine\ndrives the boost pumps (shown on the two sides of the preceding figure), which in\n",

This igniter is in the fuel line, and the hypergolic\nfluid has its own orifices in the injector of the main combustion chamber. The hyper-\ngolic fluid, followed by the fuel, enters the main combustion chamber. There, this\nfluid ignites spontaneously in contact with the liquid oxygen already injected into\nthe main combustion chamber. This method of ignition is also known as hypergolic\nstarting slug [88].\n\nThe hypergolic igniters described in the examples cited above can only be used\nonce, and therefore the rocket engines using them cannot be restarted. However,\nHulka et al [89] have described a modified version of the Russian NK-33 rocket\nengine, called AJ26-59, which has the capability of being restarted. This engine\nburns liquid oxygen and kerosene, which of course are not hypergolic propellants,\nand also uses the TEA-TEB mixture for hypergolic ignition. Its capability of being\nrestarted is obtained by carrying on board further cartridges of the TEA-TEB mixture\nthan those necessary to the first start.\n\nA rocket engine designed to burn exclusively hypergolic propellants does not\nrequire any special apparatus to be restarted as many times as necessary, because\nits propellants ignite spontaneously when coming in mutual contact. Such is the\ncase, for example, with the AJ10-190 engine (whose fuel and oxidiser are respec-\ntively monomethy] hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) used in the orbital manoeuvring\nsystem of the Space Shuttle. An engine using other propellants than those of hyper-\ngolic type requires a re-usable igniter (a spark plug, for example) and a system of\nvalves in order to be started and stopped when necessary.\n\nElectric spark igniters based on spark plugs are often used in liquid-propellant\nrockets when multiple starts are necessary. They are efficient and reliable, and can\nbe used in either direct spark igniters or augmented spark igniters.\n\nIn case of a direct spark igniter, a high-voltage electric circuit is used to generate\na spark across a gap, in order to expose the vaporised propellants in the combustion\nchamber to a ionising electric discharge, as shown in the following scheme, due to\nthe courtesy of NASA [90].\n",

Liquid catalysts, if used for this purpose, require complex\nsystems of valves and interlocking devices. This can be avoided by using solid\ncatalysts. These catalysts have also been used in liquid bi-propellant rocket engines.\nOne of such engines is the AR2-3, which was developed by Rocketdyne in the 1950s,\nand is briefly described below. The AR2-3 is one of the family of AR engines, where\nAR stands for aircraft rocket. The first engine of this family was the AR-1, which\noperated at a fixed thrust of 25577 N. It was proven in flight on the FJ-4 aircraft.\nThe AR2 series of engines includes the AR-2, the AR2-1, the AR2-2, and the AR2-\n3. All the engines of the AR2 series have a main-stage thrust of 29358 N and are\nvariable down to 14679 N of thrust. These engines use 90% hydrogen peroxide and\nkerosene. They have been used oh the FJ-4, F-86, and NF104A aircraft. They are\nliquid-propellant pump-fed engines designed to provide aircraft thrust augmentation.\nThe AR2-3 rocket engine supplies hydrogen peroxide and kerosene propellants to\nthe thrust chamber by means of two centrifugal pumps (one for the oxidiser and one\nfor the fuel). These pumps are directly driven by a single turbine. The pumps and\nthe turbine are mounted on the same shaft. The oxidiser flows from the pump outlet\nthrough the pressure-actuated oxidiser valve, through the thrust chamber cooling\njacket, and into the main thrust chamber, through the silver-plated catalytic screen\npack, where it is decomposed into super-heated steam and oxygen. The fuel flows\nfrom the pump outlet through the chamber-pressure-actuated fuel valve, into the\nconcentric annular-ring type fuel injector, and is injected into the hot, oxygen-rich\ngases, where it burns and is exhausted through the 12:1 area ratio nozzle. The auto-\nignition of the fuel eliminates the necessity of an ignition system. A small oxidiser\nflow, of about 3% from the oxidiser pump discharge, is delivered and metered through\nthe thrust control valve into a catalytic gas generator, where it is decomposed into\nsuper-heated steam and oxygen to drive the turbine.\n\nA scheme of the engine flow described above is shown in the following figure,\ndue to the courtesy of NASA [92].\n",

This holds in particular in case of manned missions. For this purpose,\na safety device is required to control the supply of fuel or oxidiser or both to a\nliquid-propellant engine. A delayed ignition in the combustion chamber causes an\naccumulation of fuel within the chamber. This accumulation can cause an explosion\nand consequently the destruction of the engine or even of the whole vehicle on which\nthe engine is mounted. These destructive effects can be avoided by interrupting or\nreducing the flow of either fuel, or oxidiser, or both to the combustion chamber\nwhen the combustion does not take place within a proper period of time. When a\nmalfunction is detected, the control system switches the engine to a safe lock-up\nmode or shuts the engine down.\n\nIn order to assure a timely and even ignition of propellants and a smooth and\nquick increase in their flow to the rated value, the initial values of flow and mixture\nratio are different from the corresponding operational values. A low initial value\nof flow prevents an excessive quantity of unburned fuel from accumulating in the\ncombustion chamber. An initial value of mixture ratio close to the stoichiometric\n",

This fact, in turn,\nmakes it possible to the hot gases in the combustion chamber to reach an equilibrium\nmore rapidly than would be the case with other values of mixture ratio. By contrast,\nas has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.4, the mixture ratio in operating conditions is\nusually fuel-rich, in order to obtain a high value of specific impulse.\n\nAccording to Sutton and Biblarz [2], the total time required to start a liquid-\npropellant rocket engine comprises ideally the following times:\n\n(1) time (from 0.002 s to more than | s) taken by the valves, which control the\nadmittance of the propellants in the combustion chamber, to move from the\nclosed position to the fully open position;\n\n(2) time taken by the propellants to go from the valves to the injector face;\n\n(3) time taken by the propellants to form and mix discrete streams of droplets into\nthe combustion chamber;\n\n(4) time (from 0.02 to 0.05 s) taken by the droplets of propellant to vaporise and\nignite;\n\n(5) time taken by the flame front to propagate downstream of the ignition section\nalong the axis of the combustion chamber; and\n\n(6) time taken by the ignited propellant to raise the temperature and the pressure\nwithin the combustion chamber to values so high as to make the combustion\nself-sustaining.\n\nThere are overlaps in these intervals of time, because some of them may occur\nsimultaneously. Apart from interval (4), the length of these intervals increases with\nthe diameter of the combustion chamber.\n\nThe propellant valves are designed in such a way as to operate in a desired\nsequence, in order to admit one of the propellant before the other in the combus-\ntion chamber, and to also control the flow and the mixture ratio. Such valves are\noften partially opened at the ignition time, for the purpose of avoiding the accumu-\nlation of unburned propellants in the combustion chamber. After a signal indicating\na successful ignition has been received by the controller, the valves are moved to the\nfully open position and the full flow of propellants arrives at the combustion chamber.\n\nThe signal of successful ignition can be generated by using several devices. Some\nof such devices are indicated below. They are:\n\n(a) Photocells for visual detection.\n\n(b) Optical detectors, such as cells, mounted inside the combustion chamber,\nwhich are sensitive to the visible or infrared radiation which is emitted by the\ncombusted gases.\n\n(c) Pyrometers, which determine the temperature of the combusted gases by\nmeasuring the wavelength of the emitted radiation.\n\n(d) Fusible wire links, which are based on a fusible wire strung between two parallel\nconductors placed near the exit section of the thrust chamber, downstream of\nthe throat.

When the wire is melted, due to the\nheat generated by a correct ignition, then the motor circuit is interrupted and\nthe propellant valves reach the fully open position. By contrast, when the wire\nis not melted, because the combustion reaction has not been initiated correctly,\nthen the electric motor continues to operate, and moves the propellant valves to\nthe closed position. Before the rocket engine is started, the propellant valves are\nin the closed position and the electric circuit carries no current. At the starting\nmoment, the closure of a switch causes the electric motor to be fed by current,\nand therefore the propellant valves are moved toward the open position. A device\nlike this was invented in 1952 by Prentiss [93].\n\n(e) Pressure-sensing devices, apt to detect the pressure rise in the combustion\nchamber due to a correct ignition of the propellants.

Such devices detect the correct operation\nof spark plugs by sensing the ionisation near the electrodes.\n\n2.9 Combustion Instability\n\nAs has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.6, by combustion instability we mean the\n\npresence of self-sustaining pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber of a\n\nrocket engine. This phenomenon can appear in thermal devices when an unsteady\n\nrelease of heat is coupled with pressure oscillations. In a rocket engine, the heat\nreleased by the substances which react chemically is coupled with acoustic fluctu-\nations. When the unsteady heat release and the acoustic fluctuations are in phase,\nthen even a small perturbation will amplify according to the criterion enunciated by\nLord Rayleigh. This criterion states that \u201cIf heat be given to the air at the moment\nof greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction,\nthe vibration is encouraged. On the other hand, if heat be given at the moment of\ngreatest rarefaction, or abstracted at the moment of greatest condensation, the vibra-\ntion is discouraged\u201d. In addition, \u201cWhen the transfer of heat takes place at the moment\nof greatest condensation or of greatest rarefaction, the pitch is not affected ... the\npitch is raised if heat be communicated to the air a quarter period before the phase\nof greatest condensation; and the pitch is lowered if heat be communicated a quarter\nperiod after the phase of greatest condensation\u201d [94]. In other terms, the oscilla-\ntions in a combustor are self-sustained when the rate of heat release and the pressure\nfluctuations are in phase. When this happens, pressure oscillations of large ampli-\ntude occur in a combustion chamber at frequencies of hundreds of hertz. Acoustic\nwaves cause unsteadiness in a combustion process. An unsteady combustion process,\n",

This fact can be represented graphically by\nmeans of the following feedback scheme.\n\nExternal Pr turbati\n\nAn unsteady release of heat adds energy to the acoustic waves in the combustion\nchamber, when the unsteady heat release rate is in phase with the pressure oscillations\nat the location of the heat source, in accordance with the criterion of Lord Rayleigh.\nConsequently, the flame in the chamber may be extinguished or may come back to the\ninjector face and burn part of the injection system. The amplitude of these oscillations\ncan become so large as to damage the structure of the combustion chamber or destroy\nthe engine.\n\nThese pressure waves can travel at sonic velocities up and down the length of\nthe combustion chamber, around it, across it, or radially in and out.

This programme lasted for four years: from\n1962 to 1965. During this time, the engine was subject to more than 2000 full-scale\ntests [96]. Copper baffles were added to the injector plate to restrain the propagation\nof the pressure waves. The recovered injector plate of an F-1 engine (on display at the\nMuseum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.) is shown in the following figure,\ndue to the courtesy of Wikipedia [97].\n\n- nt > 4\nre 2s ,\n\nAnother example of passive control is the Pratt & Whitney FT8 gas turbine, which\nuses 13 Helmholtz resonators. These devices act as vibration absorbers, whose shape\nis chosen so that the absorption is tuned to a particular frequency, as the sequel will\nshow.\n\nAs has been shown above, the symmetry of the combustion chamber lends itself\nto certain natural acoustic modes which are driven into resonance because of their\ncoupling with the rate of heat release. Several methods of breaking the symmetry of\nthe chamber have been proven effective in quenching the combustion instabilities.\n\nCombustion instabilities have been classified according to their respective\nfrequency ranges, even though there are no sharp limiting lines to separate the\nso-called low, intermediate, and high frequency ranges.\n\nThe low-frequency (also called chugging) class includes pressure waves whose\nfrequencies are less than 180 hertz [5]. In other terms, the low-frequency class\nincludes waves whose lengths are much larger than the characteristic length (defined\n",
    "195": "188 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly\nin Sect. 2.4) of the combustion chamber. The instabilities belonging to this class begin\nwith a sinusoidal wave, whose amplitude grows linearly with time. Such instabilities\nresult from a coupling between the combustion process and the feed system [47].\nThey are usually eliminated by increasing the pressure drop in the injector, or by\nincreasing the length-to-diameter ratio in the injector, or by decreasing the volume\nof the combustion chamber [49].\n\nThe high-frequency (also called screaming) class includes pressure waves whose\nfrequencies are equal to or greater than 1000 hertz [5]. The following figure, due to\nthe courtesy of NASA [98], shows pressure oscillation in a combustion chamber of\na rocket engine in the presence of a high-frequency instability.\n\nPRESSURE\nPRESSURE\nTIME\n\nThis is type of combustion instability which causes the most destructive effects.\nAn oscillatory source of energy is required to sustain this particular instability. This\nenergy comes from the combustion of the propellants, and is supplied according\nto the manner in which the combustion takes place. Each pressure wave interacts\nwith the burning gases so strongly as to receive the sustaining energy directly from\nthem, which means within a time interval no longer than the semi-period of the wave\nitself. Some of the means by which the combustion process supplies energy to the\npressure waves are loss of ignition, delays due to chemical preparation or other causes,\ndetonations, anomalous behaviour of droplets heated above their critical temperature\nand pressure, et c.\n\nThe two principal methods used to eliminate the combustion instability of the\nhigh-frequency class are the following: (1) changing the environment in which the\ncombustion process takes place, by changing either the geometric properties of\nthe combustion chamber or the manner (pattern of the injection holes, or size of\nthe injector holes, or pressure drop) in which the propellants are injected into the\ncombustion chamber; and (2) increasing the damping characteristics of the combus-\ntion chamber. Some means of passive control, which can be classified in the second of\nthese methods, are baffles, acoustic liners, and resonators installed in the combustion\nchamber. They are briefly described below.\n\nBaffles are mechanical devices meant to regulate or restrain the gas flow in the\nvicinity of the injector face, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy\nof NASA [49].

This means that work is done over each cycle in moving the fluid back and\nforth at the boundary. This work is equal to the energy dissipated due to jet formation\nand friction [49].\n\nTwo common types of acoustic resonators are Helmholtz resonators and quarter-\nwavelength tubes.\n\nA Helmholtz resonator is a rigid-walled cavity of volume V (m?), which is\nconnected through a circular orifice of diameter d (m) and length \u00a2 (m) to the\ncombustion chamber, where undesirable pressure oscillations are expected to occur.\nA Helmholtz resonator is shown in the following figure.\n",

The loudspeaker emitted plane harmonic or random\nacoustic waves. A random acoustic disturbance was generated by the loudspeaker,\nand the sound pressure level (dB) was determined as a function of frequency at\nseveral points in the combustion chamber. By so doing, several peaks corresponding\nto the various vibration modes of the combustion chamber were determined. In order\nto determine the mode shapes, the individual modes were excited by introducing a\nplane, harmonic acoustic wave at the given frequency. After determining the natural\nfrequencies (512 and 1880 Hz) of their combustion chamber, Frendi et al [99] selected\nthe frequency of 1880 Hz, corresponding to one of the natural frequencies found by\nthem, for extensive tests. Consequently, the resonant frequency f of the acoustic\ndevices indicated above was tuned to 1880 Hz.\n\nOther types of acoustic resonators than those described above have slots instead\nof circular orifices, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA\n[74].\n",

The beginning of a medium-\nfrequency instability usually shows a growing coherence of the combustion noise\nat a particular frequency with slowly increasing amplitude. There is usually wave\nmotion in the propellant feed system. There may also be wave motion in the combus-\ntion chamber, but this motion does not usually correspond in phase and frequency to\na natural mode of the chamber itself. The shape of the pressure wave is very nearly\nsinusoidal, and one or both of the propellant feed system may be highly coupled.\nBuzzing-type instabilities are not particularly damaging if they remain at low ampli-\ntudes, but may degrade performance, total impulse, or thrust vector. In some case,\nthe amplitude increases to such an extent as to triggering a high-frequency mode\n[49]. This type of instability occurs more frequently in medium-size engines (whose\nthrust is in the range 2000-250,000 N) than in large engines [2].\n\nFinally, many rocket vehicles propelled by engines burning liquid propellants are\nsubject to longitudinal vibrations, because of an instability arising from interaction\nof the vehicle structure with the propulsion system. This phenomenon has been\nnicknamed pogo instability, because of its analogy with the motion of a pogo jumping\nstick. Pogo instabilities can occur in the propellant feed lines of large vehicles, such\nas space launch vehicles or ballistic missiles [2].\n\nThe oscillations due to the pogo instability occur principally in the first longitu-\ndinal mode of the structure during operation of the first stage (burning liquid propel-\nlants) of a launch vehicle. The effects of this instability are shown in the following\nfigure, due to the courtesy of NASA [101].\n",

Pogo vibrations have also occurred, but less often, in higher modes of\nlongitudinal oscillation. More periods than one of instability have also been observed,\neach of which with its own mode of vibration, during operation of a single stage of a\nrocket vehicle. Vibrations have occurred in the range from 5 to 60 Hz, and vibration\namplitudes (from zero to the peak values) have reached 17 go at the input to the\npayload and 34 go at the engine [101], where go = 9.80665 m/s? is the acceleration\nof gravity at the surface of the Earth.\n\nThe pogo vibrations can damage the crew and the equipment, and can also overload\nthe structure of a rocket vehicle. In addition, they impair the propulsion performance\nof the vehicle.\n\nIn order to suppress these vibrations, hydraulic accumulators have been installed\nin the propulsion systems of launch vehicles such as the Saturn V and the Space\nShuttle.\n\nAs an example, each of the three main engines of the Space Shuttle has a pogo\nsuppression system accumulator, which is attached to the low-pressure oxidiser\nduct.

This chapter describes feed systems using gases stored at\nhigh pressures for this purpose. A scheme of such systems is shown in the following\nfigure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].\nhigh-pressure gas high-pressure gas\nmonopropellanttank eereiitects\nPressure-Fed Pressure-Fed\nMonopropellant Bipropellant Rocket\nRocket System System (hypergolic)\nexpansion combustion\nchamber and chamber and\nnozzle nozzle\n\nA gas stored under pressure makes it possible to control the pressure in the ullage\nspace in the tanks of propellant. By ullage space we mean the volume by which a\ncontainer or a tank falls short of being full of liquid.\n\nIn a rocket engine fed by a gas stored under pressure, the pressure in the ullage\nspace is used to force the propellants through the lines of the feed system and into\nthe combustion chamber at the required pressures and flow rates.\n\u00a9 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license 203\nto Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021\nA. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines,\n\nSpringer Aerospace Technology,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_3\n",
    "211": "204 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure\n\nIn arocket engine fed by pumps, the pressure in the ullage space is used to supply\nthe propellants to the inlet section of the pumps at the required pressures, and the\npumps in turn deliver the propellants to the combustion chamber at the required\npressures and flow rates.\n\nAs a general rule, the choice of a feed system, independently of whether it uses\ngases under pressure or pumps, depends on several factors, which are principally the\nmission which the rocket vehicle is meant to accomplish, the size and the mass of this\nvehicle, the intensity and the duration of the thrust, the space available to the engine,\nthe degree of reliability of the propulsion system, and so on. In practice, according\nto Lee et al. [2], a pump-fed propulsion system is chosen when:\n\ne the engine must produce more than 4500 N of thrust, or\ne the total mass exceeds 9100 kg.\n\nIn contrast, a pressure-fed propulsion system, which may be either a mono-\npropellant or a bi-propellant system, is chosen when:\n\u00a2 the mission duty cycle is a pulse mode, or\n\u00a2 the propellant mass is less than 3600 kg.\n\nFor those cases in which the choice of the feed system is not obvious, a weight-\nand-cost trade-off study is made to determine the better system.\n\nThe types of gas used in the feed systems described here are the following:\n\u00a9 gases stored for bi-propellants;\n\ne gases obtained by evaporation of two propellants;\ne gases stored for mono-propellants; and\n\u00a9 gases obtained as combustion products.\n\nSome criteria for choosing one or another of these types are briefly presented\nbelow. A gas under pressure must be chemically compatible with the propellants and\nalso with the materials of which the tanks and the lines are made, at the temperatures\nof operation. The feed system using this gas must be simple and reliable. The gas\nused in the feed system must have a low molar mass, in order for the value of the\nmass ratio mo/m, (where mo is the mass of the rocket vehicle at launch, and m, is\nits mass at burnout) to be low. The materials used for the feed system must have a\nlow specific mass, for the same reason. These requirements will be discussed in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n\n3.2. Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure\n\nWhen the time of operation of a rocket engine is short, or when the temperature of the\ngas stored under pressure is less than or equal to the temperature of the propellants,\nthen the required mass m, (kg) of that gas can be computed by means of the law of\nperfect gases, as follows\n",

As has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.1, the\nconstant R, of a specific gas is equal to the universal gas constant R* = 8314.460 Nm\nkmol! K~! divided by the molar mass M (kg/kmol) of that gas, as follows\nR*\nR, = \u2014\nsM\n\nWhen the conditions indicated above are not satisfied, the required mass m, of\nthe gas under pressure can be computed as follows.\n\nWe consider first a rocket engine which is started only once, and assume the heat\ntransfer from the tank walls to be negligible. In such conditions, the total heat Q (J)\ntransferred from the gas under pressure to the vaporised propellant is [3]:\n\nQ = HAt(T, \u2014 Te)\nwhere H (W m~* K~!) is the total heat transfer coefficient, whose value is deter-\nmined experimentally, at the interface between liquid and gas, A (m7) is the area of\nthe interface between liquid and gas, t (s) the duration of operation, T,, (K) is the\ntemperature of the gases at burnout, and T, (K) is the temperature of the propellant.\nThe temperatures T, and T,, are assumed to have constant values at the interface\nbetween liquid and gas.\n\nThe total heat Q defined above is assumed to have heated and vaporised the\npropellant, as indicated by the following equation\n\nQ = m[epi(T, \u2014 Te) + hy + ep(Tu \u2014 T.)]\nwhere m, (kg) is the total mass of vaporised propellant, cp; and cpy (J kg!

A thermal conditioning (that is, heating or cooling\nor both) of the gas can lead to low-mass systems. On the other hand, a thermal\nconditioning of the gas implies high complexity and cost. A successful system which\ndid not condition thermally the stored gas (nitrogen) was the Lunar Orbiter velocity\nand reaction control system. By contrast, in the descent stage illustrated above of the\nApollo lunar module, helium under pressure was stored under supercritical conditions\nand then heated. This led to a reduction in mass of 60% over that of an ambient-\ntemperature high-pressure storage without thermal conditioning. These two systems\nof storage are briefly described below.\n\nThe velocity and reaction control system of the Lunar Orbiter IV is shown\nschematically in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [6].\n\nThis system was designed so that its 445-N-thrust engine, using a hypergolic\ncombination of oxidiser (N2O4) and fuel (Aerozine-50), could impart a velocity\nchange of 1017 m/s to the 387 kg spacecraft for mid-course corrections, injection\ninto an initial lunar orbit, and successive injection into a photographic orbit. The\nsource of ullage gas was a spherical tank containing gaseous nitrogen (N2) without\nprovision for conditioning the temperature of this gas. The tank was made of Ti-\n6AI-4V alloy, with a mass of 9.9 kg and an internal volume of 0.0259 m?. A mass\nof 6.56 kg of nitrogen was stored into this sphere at a pressure of 2.4 x 107 N/m?\nand at a temperature of 294 K. Two parallel-redundant normally-closed squib valves\nisolated the pressurising gas in the storage vessel from the rest of the system until\nthe gas was required for its first use. The gas in the storage vessel was also the source\nfor the cold-gas reaction control system, which is shown in the lower portion of\nthe preceding figure. Only part (from 0.91 to 1.36 kg) of the nitrogen mass in the\nstorage vessel was used to generate and maintain the pressure in the propellant tanks\nfor the velocity control system; the remaining part was used for the reaction control\nsystem and for reserve of pressurising gas. When the squib valves were opened, the\npressurising gas flowed through a normally-open shut-off squib valve to the pressure\nregulator of the velocity control system, which reduced the pressure of the gas to\n1.3 x 10\u00b0 N/m\u2019. The gas was then routed through the check valves and into the\noxidiser and fuel tanks. In the velocity control system, a single regulator was used\nto pressurise both of the propellant tanks, in order to preclude undesired in-flight\nshifts of propellant mixture ratio; such shifts could occur if each tank had its own\npressure regulator and the regulator set-point of one changed during flight. With a\nsingle regulator, the set-point could still change, but each tank could have the same\nullage pressure. Though each tank had a bladder, check valves were used to isolate the\nullage gases of the fuel and oxidiser tanks. If any propellant vapour permeated one of\n",

Each ullage had a\npressure relief system to protect the system from over-pressures.

Further combinations can be found in [7].\n\nThe requirements for the gas under pressure, which have been considered in\nSect. 3.2, apply only to the net or effective mass m, of gas necessary to pressurise\nthe tanks of propellant. However, the gross mass m, of the stored gas depends also\non the system design, on the gas expansion during operation, and on the range of the\nenvironmental temperature. The gross mass m, of the stored gas results from a sum,\nwhose addends are the net mass mz of the stored gas, the mass ms, of the residual gas\nin the storage vessel, the mass mg of the residual gas in the lines downstream of the\nregulator, the mass m_,, of the residual mass in the heat exchanger, etc., as follows\n\nMs = Mg +Msy + Mg + Mex +...\n\nA parameter which takes account of the additional terms indicated above is the\nuse factor of the pressurising gas. This parameter, whose value is greater than unity,\nis defined as the ratio m,/mg of the gross mass to the net mass of the pressuring gas.\nThe lowest value of pressure in a storage vessel depends on the values of the pressure\ndrops in the various components (regulator, heat exchanger, etc.) which make up a\nfeed system and also on a safety value. The pressurising action of a stored gas is\nconsidered to have come to an end when the pressure in its storage vessel decays to\n2.758 x 10\u00b0 N/m? [3]. When a source of heat is present inside the storage vessel, then\nthe expansion of the gas in the vessel is assumed to be polytropic (pV\u201d = constant),\nthat is, such as to involve a transfer of heat and work. By contrast, when no source of\nheat is present in the storage vessel, then the expansion of the gas in the vessel can\nbe assumed to be isentropic (pV\u201d = constant), that is, frictionless and without heat\ntransfer between the gas and the vessel walls. The following equation can be used to\ncalculate the final temperature T, (K) of the gas in the storage vessel\n\noa\nTi Pi\nwhere T, (K) is the initial temperature of the gas in the storage vessel, n is the\nexponent of the polytropic expansion, and pz (N/m?) and p; (N/m?) are respectively\nthe final pressure and the initial pressure in the storage vessel.\n",

This expansion\ncomes to an end in the propellant tanks. The temperature of the propellants in the tanks\nis assumed to be equal to the temperature at the outlet section of the heat exchanger.\nFor a specified range of temperatures in a pressure-feed system, the lower value can\nbe used to determine the mass of the pressurising gas, and the upper value can be\nused to determine the volume of the storage vessel, for a given storage pressure [3].\n\nIn the following example of application, an isentropic expansion process is\nassumed to occur in the oxidiser (N2O4) tank of a pressure-fed system having the\nfollowing properties: temperature range 278-311 K in the storage vessel at the system\nstart, pressure p, = 3.1 x 107 N/m? in the storage vessel at the system start, pressure\nPu = 2.76 x 10\u00b0 N/m? in the storage vessel at burnout, volume Vy = 0.0113 m?\nin the gas lines downstream of the regulator, volume V,, = 0.0283 m? in the heat\nexchanger, negligible residual volume in the gas lines, and a 2% reserve of pres-\nsurising gas.

Such vessels are usually of monocoque design, operate at high\nstress levels, are mounted within the rocket vehicle, and are insulated from deflec-\ntion of the vehicle structure by appropriately designed mountings [2]. By the way,\nmonocoque (a French word meaning single shell) is a structural technique in which\na body supports loads through its external skin, with no internal frame to hold the\nbody rigid. The alloy most often used to construct storage vessels is Ti6Al4V [8].\n\nAn estimate for the mass m (kg) of a spherical vessel of thickness \u00a2 (m), inside\ndiameter d (m), and made of a material having uniform density p (kg/m?) can be\nmade as follows\n\n4 4 q +t : dy\"\nn= =<70 = -([=\nOe BOING 2\n",
    "230": "3.3. Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Bi-Propellants 223\n\nAnother estimate, suggested by Huzel and Huang [3], for the same mass m (kg)\ncan be made by assuming a vessel made of two hemispherical shells, such that the\nthickness of the weld lands is taken into account by assuming a band of width w (m)\nand thickness equal to one-half the wall thickness placed over the weld seam. This\nestimate is\n\nm= xd (2) + 39.37 wd?p(#)\n4o 80\n\nwhere p (N/m?) is the maximum pressure at which the gas is stored, and o (N/m?)\nis the allowable working stress of the material of which the vessel is made.\n\nThe storage vessel must be capable of containing the gas at high pressure for long\nperiods of time without losses due to leakage. Gases having low molar masses, such\nas hydrogen and helium, are less subject to leak through homogeneous metals of\ngood quality than is the case with those having high molar masses. Leakages can\noccur through porous metals, for example, through castings and welded joints.\n\nThe pressure-fed systems cited above (used for the descent stage of the Apollo\nlunar module and for the velocity and reaction control system of the Lunar Orbiter)\nhave, each of them, a pressure regulator for the gases (respectively, helium and\nnitrogen) stored under pressure. A regulator maintains the desired values of flow and\npressure to the propellant tanks as the pressure of the stored gas decreases.\n\nThe example described below refers to a pressure regulator used for the Space\nStorable Propulsion Module, which was used for a Jupiter Orbiter mission.\n\nWith reference to the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [9], this\npressure regulator has an unbalanced poppet, which achieves sealing to the seat by\nmeans of the upstream pressure force. In addition, the poppet is held against the seat\nby an axial guidance flexure.\n\nThe actuation mechanism consists of a bellows, which is exposed to space inter-\nnally and to the regulator downstream pressure externally, and which is held in the null\nposition by one or more coil springs. If the regulator downstream pressure decreases\nfrom the preset pressure, the reference spring force overcomes the bellows pressure\nforce and the actuator exerts a net opening force on the poppet through the lever\narrangement. When this net force is greater than the poppet seating force, the poppet\nopens and allows the gas (helium) under pressure to pressurise the downstream side\nof the regulator. When the downstream regulator pressure rises back up to the set\npressure, the actuator returns to the null position and the poppet is caused to return\nto the seat by the axial guidance flexure spring force and the difference of pressure\nacross the poppet [9].\n",

The temperature of the pressurising gas which leaves the heat\nexchanger at any time also depends on the temperature of the same gas at the exit\nsection of the storage vessel. The material, of which the tube of the heat exchanger\nis made, is to be chosen by the designer bearing in mind the necessity of attaching\nfirmly by brazing the tube to the wall of the nozzle. The width of this tube depends\non the thermal and mechanical loads to which the tube is subject.\n\nThe following example of application concerns the design of a heat exchanger of\nthe type illustrated above, used in parallel with other heat exchangers and placed at\nthe cross-section of area ratio A/A,; = 10 of a nozzle extension for a rocket engine of\nknown characteristics.\n\nLet A, = 0.02606 m? be the area at the throat, ri, = 0.0109 kg/s be the mass flow\nrate of the pressurising gas (helium), and p.. = py = 3.1026 x 107 N/m? its pressure\nin the storage vessel.

A description and a\nlist of these propellants are given in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.4.\n\nIn particular, these feed systems have been used in large rocket vehicles whose\npropulsion systems are fed by pumps. They have been used especially for oxidisers,\nbecause most fuels tend to boil violently when heated. However, liquid hydrogen,\nwhich is a fuel, is an exception to this rule. Since the oxidiser vapour has usually a\nhigh molar mass, feed systems using evaporation of two propellants require a mass\nof pressurising gas for the oxidiser tank higher than the mass required by systems\nusing inert gases, such as those described in Sect. 3.3. This undesirable effect is\ncounterbalanced by the elimination of storage vessels, because in feed systems using\nevaporation of two propellants the pressurising agent is stored as a liquid in the tank\ncontaining the main propellant.\n\nFeed systems based on evaporation of two propellants used for pump-fed rocket\nengines take propellants tapped off downstream of the pump and vaporised in a heat\nexchanger. These propellants are then used to pressurise the main propellant tank\nfrom which they have been taken. There are many types of heat exchangers. One of\nthem is the helical-coil type, which is described below. A functional scheme of this\nheat exchanger is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Wikimedia\n",

It is mounted\nin the turbine exhaust duct between the oxidiser turbine discharge manifold and\nthe thrust chamber. It heats and expands gaseous helium for use in the third stage\nof the Saturn V rocket or converts liquid oxygen to gaseous oxygen for the second\nstage for maintaining pressurisation in the oxidiser tank of the vehicle. During engine\noperation, either liquid oxygen is tapped off the oxidiser high-pressure duct or helium\nis provided from the vehicle stage and routed to the heat exchanger coils [16].\n\nHeat exchangers have also been employed on the Titan rockets to vaporise liquid\nnitrogen tetroxide to be used as the pressurising agent [2].\n\nAs has been shown above, evaporated-propellant pressurisation is successful with\ncryogenic propellants and also with the storable oxidiser nitrogen tetroxide, whose\nboiling point is 294.2 K. The simplest method of evaporated-propellant pressurisation\nis self-pressurisation (flash boiling) in a propellant tank during feed-out. By the way,\nflash boiling is the phenomenon which occurs in a heated liquid whose pressure\nis lower than the saturation vapour pressure of the liquid. When the pressure falls\nsufficiently below the saturation vapour pressure, then rapid boiling of the liquid can\nresult.\n\nThe self-pressurisation method is reliable, but the mass requirements of the pres-\nsurising agent are high, because of its low temperature, and hence of its high density.\nIn addition, pre-pressurisation from a separate system may be necessary to meet\nengine start requirements, as was the case with the Centaur rocket vehicle [2]. In\nthis case, the vapour pressure of bulk propellants (hydrogen and oxygen) boiling\nin the tanks was used to provide the modest pressure required at the inlet of tank-\nmounted boost pumps. In systems requiring higher pressures, superheated vapour is\nobtained by passing the propellant through an engine heat exchanger or some other\nheat source, as will be shown below.\n\nMore favourable conditions exist in the ullage space when the pressurising agent\nis heated to the maximum temperature compatible with structural and propellant\nrequirements, and when the temperature of the gas in the ullage space is stratified,\nthat is, controlled by heating or cooling at the tank wall and upper bulkhead [2].\n\nIn the S-II (meaning by this name the second stage of the Saturn V rocket),\nwhich used evaporated-propellant pressurisation in both oxidiser and fuel systems,\npropellant vapour was superheated to reduce the mass of gas required to the minimum.\nFor main stage pressurisation, the oxidiser tank of the S-II was pressurised with warm\ngaseous oxygen (275 + 8 K at the maximum mixture ratio, and 250 + 8 K at low\nmixture ratio). As shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [2],\nthe pressurising agent for the oxygen was obtained by extracting a portion of the\nliquid oxygen (at a temperature of approximately 94 K) leaving the discharge area of\nthe pump and routing this fluid through the shell-and-tube heat exchanger, which has\nbeen shown in the preceding figure. The turbine outlet gas provided the heat source\n(at 598 + 30 K at the maximum mixture ratio, and 548 + 35 K at low mixture ratio)\nfor the heat exchanger. Within the heat exchanger, the liquid oxygen was vaporised\nand then routed into a collector. From there, the gaseous oxygen was routed into the\nullage space of the oxygen tank through a flow restrictor and gas distributor.\n",

This gas generator consists of two electrically-fired\ninitiators (squibs), one charge of igniter pellets, some safety and arming devices, one\nregulator of the pressure-relief type, and two solid-propellant grains. There may also\nbe, in some cases, a device to cool the hot gas produced. The gas generator illustrated\nabove is contained in an insulated housing made of steel. This housing, in turn, is\ncontained in the main propellant tank, which is made of an aluminium alloy. The\ngas outlets are hermetically sealed by means of burst diaphragms which assure a\nsafe storage of the solid propellant over long periods of time. At the proper moment,\nthe propellant grains are ignited by the igniter pellets. The gases generated by the\ncombustion process pressurise the main propellants for the duration of the propellant\ngrains. Such grains are designed to produce the desired pressures and flow rates\nwithin a given range of temperature. In case of the upper limit of temperature being\nexceeded, a regulator discharges overboard the excess gases.\nSome types of solid-propellant gas generators used for feed systems are briefly\ndescribed below. The following figure illustrates two solid-propellant gas generators,\none of which without cooling and the other with a solid coolant.\n",

When the\nsolid propellant is ignited, the hot gases are passed through the filter, regulated, and\ndirected to the main propellant tanks. The regulator or the orifice mentioned above\ndumps overboard the excess gas, and therefore a vent line must be present for this\npurpose.\n\nThe gas generator shown in the lower part of the preceding figure consists of\na solid-propellant charge with igniter, a sublimating solid coolant, a filter, and a\nregulator. When the solid propellant is ignited, the hot gases are cooled by passing\nthrough a solid material which decomposes or sublimates. This cooling process\ngenerates additional gases. The mixture of gases generated in this manner is passed\nthrough the filter, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks.\n\nHuzel and Huang [3] describe a gas generator using ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)\nas the solid propellant, which has a flame temperature of about 1544 K. The ammo-\nnium nitrate is used with a solid coolant made of oxalic acid (HOOCCOOH or\n(COOH):) compressed into pellets. Oxalic acid decomposes endothermically, at a\ntemperature above 394 K, and produces a mixture of gases consisting of carbon\nmonoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O). The desired temperature\nis obtained by adjusting the ratio of the propellant to the coolant. By so doing, a\ntemperature of 478 K has been reached [3].\n\nThe following figure illustrates a solid-propellant gas generator having an azide\ncooling pack.\n\nSolid propellant Azidepack Cyclone\ncharge separator\u00bb inp type\nregulator\nFilter propellant tanks\nMetallic\nparticles\n",
    "250": "3.6 Feed Systems Using Combustion Products 243\nIn this gas generator, the hot gas resulting from the combustion of a solid propellant\nis cooled by passing through an azide material. An example of this material is sodium\nazide (NaN;), which decomposes after being heated at or above approximately 573 K\ninto gaseous nitrogen (N2) and sodium (Na) particles, as follows\n2NaN3 \u2014 2Na+ 3N2\n\nThese particles are removed when the gas containing them passes through a\ncyclone separator. The gas coming from this separator is filtered to remove further\nparticles, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks. A gas generator like\nthis has made it possible to obtain gaseous nitrogen at a temperature of about 590 K\n[3].\n\nGenerally speaking, a cyclone separator is a device which removes solid particles\nfrom a gaseous or liquid stream without using filters. The solid particles are removed\nbecause they are denser than the other molecules of the stream. A fluid mixed with\nsolid particles enters tangentially in a cyclone, which consists of a cylindrical body,\na conical outlet for the particles, and a top axial pipe outlet for the clean fluid. An\nouter vortex is created due to the centrifugal force applied to the molecules, and the\nfluid circles down to the bottom end of the cone. Particles of high density are pushed\nagainst the wall and separated from the fluid. In the conical part, the fluid reverses\nthe direction of its motion, goes up via the central part of the cyclone (inner vortex),\nand exits on the top by the fluid outlet pipe.

This system requires a large vessel to\nstore the solid propellant and the helium at high pressure.\n\n3.7 Control Systems for Liquid-Propellant Gas Generators\n\nAs has been shown in Sect. 3.6, liquid-propellant gas generators require a careful\ndesign, in order to avoid problems concerning the chemical compatibility of the\npressurising gas with the propellants, or the temperature of this gas, or the presence\nof condensible elements into it. These problems can be solved by using control\nsystems, which are described in the present paragraph.\n\nAs far as the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas is concerned, hydrazine\nmono-propellant is considered satisfactory in view of the chemical characteristics\nand the molar masses of the gases (nitrogen and hydrogen) resulting from its decom-\nposition in the presence of a catalyst. These gases contain no carbon, and therefore\ngenerate no deposits which could lower the performance of a heat exchanger. In case\nof gas generators using a combination of two liquid propellants, the gases generated\nby them can be made chemically compatible with the propellants by varying the value\nof the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio o/f with respect to the stoichiometric value. By\nso doing, the same combination of propellants can be used to generate a pressurising\ngas compatible with both the oxidiser and the fuel. An example is given by the hyper-\ngolic combination of nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozine 50, which was used for the first\nand second stages of the Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile and Titan space\n",

As has been shown in Sect. 3.6, the gas generator of the Titan\nengine uses the engine propellants to produce fuel-rich exhaust gases which drive\nthe engine turbo-pumps.\n\nAs far as the temperature of the pressurising gas is concerned, more than one option\ncan be chosen to assure compatibility. One of such options consists in varying of the\nvalue of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio to lower the combustion temperature, as\nhas been shown above. Another option consists in injecting a non-reacting liquid into\nthe gas generator, in order to subtract heat from the combusted gas in the evaporation\nof this liquid. A third option consists in cooling the gas by means of a heat exchanger,\nthrough which the gas flows with one of the liquid propellants. Of course, this option\ncan be chosen only when the propellant can safely absorb the heat coming from the\ncombusted gas.\n\nThe presence of condensible elements into the combusted gas can be avoided\nby regulating the combustion temperature, as will be shown below. In order for the\nmolar mass of the combusted gas to be low, the combustion temperature of a fuel-rich\nmixture should reach a value (approximately 811 K) sufficient to break the bonds of\nthe complex molecules of the combustion products and give rise to substances having\nlow-mass molecules. Of course, this result can be obtained only when the fuel injected\nin excess into the gas generator does not reduce the combustion temperature below\nabout 811 K. This is because, when the temperature is too low, some molecules of the\ncombusted gas have a high molar mass, and these molecules are subject to condense.\n\nSome typical control systems used for liquid-propellant gas generators are briefly\ndescribed below.\n\nOne of these control systems uses a single gas generator, which provides gas under\npressure to both the fuel tank and the oxidiser tank, with injection cooling. A scheme\nof this system is shown in the following figure.\n\n| Regulator\n(-)\nor second Propellant\npropellant\n() Gas generator\nTo main propellant\ntanks\n",
    "253": "246 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure\nThe liquid substances employed may be either a mono-propellant and an inert\ncoolant or a combination of two propellants. In the second case, the cooling is\nobtained by injecting the second propellant in excess with respect to the quantity\nnecessary for the stoichiometric mixture ratio. The mono-propellant and the coolant\nor the two propellants are kept under pressure by means of gaseous helium stored\nat a high pressure in a vessel. Downstream of this vessel, the pressure is kept to the\ndesired value by using valves and a pressure regulator. This system makes it possible\nto cool the gas coming from the gas generator to a temperature compatible with the\npropellants. A combination of liquid substances must be studied carefully, in order\nto satisfy not only the temperature requirement, but also the other requirements, and\nin particular the one concerning the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas\nwith both of the propellants. To this regard, fuel-rich gases have been found apt to\npressurise storable oxidisers. Examples of such oxidisers are given in [3].\n\nAnother of these control systems uses a single gas generator and a heat exchanger,\nas shown in the following scheme, which refers to the case of a gas generator using\na combination of two propellants.\n\n| | Regulator\n(=) (=)\npropellant\nC) Gas generator\ncas\n\nHeat A\nexchanger eB\n\nTo oxidiser To fuel\n\ntank tank\n\nThe hot gas coming from the gas generator is directed to a heat exchanger, in\norder to transfer heat to the cold helium.

The other gas generator operates with injection of excess\nfuel, and produces a cool, fuel-rich gas, which is used to pressurise the main fuel\ntank. This system requires a balance in the output of the two gas generators and also\na pressure control in both of the main propellant tanks.

Huzel and Huang [3] have suggested four criteria\nto be considered in this study. They are:\n\n\u00a9 mission requirements for the rocket vehicle;\n\ne chemical compatibility of the propellants with the materials;\n",
    "256": "3.9 Choice of a Feed System Using Gases Under Pressure 249\ne system reliability; and\ne system performance.\n\nThe mission requirements concern the possibility of using storable propellants,\nthe need to start the engine one or more times, and the capability of controlling the\nvalues of pressure in the ullage space.\n\nThe chemical compatibility of the propellants with the materials concern the\nabsence of reactivity between the propellants and the materials of which their\ncontainers are made, the absence of condensible or soluble particles in the combusted\ngas, and the maintenance of a desired value of temperature in the gas under pressure.\n\nThe system reliability depends on the degree of complexity of the system, on the\nnumber of its failure modes, and on the number of its components. The reliability of\neach component, in turn, is to be evaluated considering its time of development and\nthe funds available. To this regard, components expected to require greater efforts\nof development to reach desirable degrees of reliability are gas generators, heat\nexchangers forming an integral part of the thrust chamber, storage vessels subject to\nhigh pressures, and pipes and regulators for gases at high temperatures.\n\nThe system performance depends on the gross mass of the gas stored for pressuri-\nsation, which in turn depends on its molar mass and also on the mass of the system\nof pressurisation. The latter mass is part of the mass of the rocket vehicle at burnout.\nReferences\n\n1. Greene WD (2013) Inside the LEO doghouse, start me up!

[2], an axial-flow pump consists\nof a set of discs or a cylinder carrying aerofoil-shaped blades on the periphery, which\nrotates at high speed within a casing or housing which contains fixed blades (stator\nvanes) placed between the rotor blades. Small clearances at the blade tips and between\nrotor blades and stator vanes are maintained under all operating conditions. The flow\nis nearly parallel to the pump shaft, and head rise (defined below) is produced by\nsummation of increases in pressure produced as the fluid traverses each set (stage)\nof rotor blades and stator vanes. Axial-flow pumps have small diameters but give\nmodest pressure increases. Although multiple compression stages are needed, axial-\nflow pumps work well with low-density fluids. The following figure, due to the\ncourtesy of NASA [2], is a cross-sectional view of the axial-flow Mark 15-fuel\n(liquid hydrogen) turbo-pump used for the J-2 engine.\nDIFFUSER\nwees PUN VOLUTE TURBINE\nrer ROTORS\nSTATOR\naes BEARING\nfT a / 2\n\u201c4 4,8) Ny , Chet) TURBINE STATOR\nIMOUCER STATOR h-4 pest.

Much of this\nvelocity is converted to pressure increase by the diffuser which surrounds the impeller\nand collects the fluid. The rotating blades are typically enclosed within a casing, and\nare used to impart energy to a fluid through centrifugal force. A centrifugal-flow pump\nhas two principal parts: (1) a rotating element, which includes the impeller and the\nshaft; and (2) a fixed element, which is made up of a casing (volute), a stuffing box to\nprevent the pumped fluid from coming out of the volute casing from the location of\nthe shaft, and bearings, which absorb the radial and axial loads transmitted through\nthe shaft, keep the rotating element in position and in correct alignment with the\nfixed element, and permit the shaft to rotate with the least possible amount of friction.\nCentrifugal-flow pumps are far more powerful than axial-flow pumps for high-density\nfluids, but require large diameters for low-density fluids.

A mixed-flow pump pushes the fluid out\naway from the pump shaft. Pressure is developed in the pump partly by centrifugal\nforce and partly by the lifting action of the mixed-flow impeller. Of the three types\n(axial-flow, centrifugal-flow, and mixed-flow) of turbo-pumps described above, those\nof the centrifugal-flow type are the most frequently used. However, when the pumped\nfluid is liquid hydrogen, multistage axial-flow turbo-pumps are frequently used, due\nto the lowest temperature and density of this fluid.

For\nvelocity ratios above 0.34, reaction turbines are generally used, because they are\nmore efficient than impulse turbines.

For convenience of the reader, these cycles are mentioned below.\nThey are the gas-generator cycle (used for either a mono-propellant or a couple of\npropellants), the tap-off cycle, the expander cycle, and the staged-combustion cycle.\n\nThe present section is meant to show how the energy resulting from gases which\nexpand in one or two turbines, as indicated above, is used to drive the pumps. In\nother words, we describe here the manners of coupling the turbines with the pumps.\nThe drive arrangements depend on the propellants burned in the rocket and also\non the general design of its engine.

When the turbines operate in series, the initial turbo-pump can\nrotate faster than the other, which reduces the turbine flow rate requirements. The J-2\nand J-2S engines used this arrangement. When the turbines operate in parallel, great\nflexibility is obtained for off-design modes of operation, such as starting, throttling,\nand using variable values of mixture ratio.

The turbo-\npump is mounted on the side of the thrust chamber, and requires only two short,\nhigh-pressure ducts connecting the volute outlets to the main propellant valves. The\nturbine is started by a solid-propellant cartridge, and is powered by a liquid-propellant\ngas generator during main operation. The high-speed turbine drives the turbo-pump\nthrough a series of reduction gears which drive the main shaft. On the H-1 engine of\nthe Saturn IB booster, the turbo-pump gears and bearings are cooled and lubricated\nby means of a fuel additive blender unit, which mixes the fuel with an oxidation\nand corrosion inhibitor additive (Oronite\u00ae 262, that is, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate)\nand injects the mixture (98% RP-1 plus 2% additive) at the flow rate 0.000347 m?/s\ninto the turbo-pump gearbox [12]. On other engines, a separate tank for lubricating\noil is provided. During main operation, the turbo-pump supplies oxidiser and fuel,\nat the required pressures and flow rates, to the main thrust chamber and to the gas\ngenerator.\n\nAs shown in the preceding figure, both of the pumps are of the centrifugal-flow\ntype. They are mounted back-to-back on the same shaft. Each of them consists\nof an axial-flow inducer, a centrifugal-flow impeller with backward-curved blades,\na diffuser with static vanes, and a volute, according to the scheme shown in the\nfollowing figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3].\n",

The\nperformance of a turbo-pump affects the payload for the following reasons. Firstly,\nbecause the mass of a turbo-pump contributes to the mass of a rocket stage at burnout.\nTherefore, a high mass of a turbo-pump implies a low mass of the payload, for a\ngiven mass of a rocket stage at burnout.\n\nSecondly, because the pressure required at the inlet flange of a pump determines\nthe pressure of the pumped propellant in its tank. Therefore, when the pressure\nrequired at the inlet flange of a pump is high, the mass of the system of pressurisation\nin a propellant tank is also high, and consequently the payload mass is low for a given\nmass of a rocket stage at burnout.\n\nThirdly, because gases coming from the exhaust duct of a turbine are expelled at a\nlower specific impulse than gases coming from the thrust chamber. Such is the case,\n",
    "284": "4.6 Turbo-Pump Performance 277\nfor example, with a rocket engine using the gas-generator cycle or the tap-off cycle,\nwhich are, both of them, open cycles. When this happens, the overall specific impulse\nof a rocket engine decreases as a result of the lower specific impulse of the gases\ncoming from the exhaust duct of the turbine. Therefore, a decrease in performance,\nin terms of lower specific impulse, implies a lower mass of the payload, for a given\nmass of a rocket stage at burnout.\n\nA quantity, called Equivalent Mass Factor of a turbo-pump (EMF 7p), measured\nin seconds, is used to take account of the low value of the specific impulse possessed\nby the gas coming from the exhaust duct of a turbine. Sobin et al. [12] define this\nquantity as follows\n\nEMFyp = 2m? [: _ dsr je\n\nads )g Use] F\n\nwhere mp, (kg) is the mass of the payload, (/;)g (s) is the specific impulse of the gas\nexhausted by the thrust chamber of the engine, (/;)r (s) is the specific impulse of the\ngas exhausted by the turbine, go (m/s\u2019) is the acceleration of gravity, and F (N) is the\nthrust of the engine. The value of the partial derivative on the right-hand side of the\npreceding equation depends on the velocity increment required by the mission, the\nsystem gross mass, the system specific impulse, and the stage propellant mass fraction\nRy = m,/mo (see Chap. 1, Sect. 1.3). For a rocket engine using a gas-generator cycle,\nthe value of EMF 7p ranges from 5 s for booster engines to 200 s for upper-stage\nengines [12]. For a rocket engine using a staged-combustion cycle, (J;)7 = (Js), and\ntherefore the corresponding EMF'7p is essentially zero [12].\n\nThe effect of a turbo-pump on a stage payload is taken into account by adding\nthe mass mp (kg) of the turbo-pump to the product resulting from multiplying the\nEMF 7\u00bb (s) by the mass flow rate m7 (kg/s) of the gas coming from the exhaust duct\nof the turbine, as follows\n\nEMry = mrp + EMF pp - mr\n\nThe quantity EMr, measured in kg, is called the equivalent mass of a turbo-\npump. This quantity is an index of performance of a turbo-pump, because the best\nturbo-pump has the lowest value of equivalent mass.\n\nThe value of equivalent mass can be reduced by decreasing either the mass mrp\nof the turbo-pump or the mass flow rate mr of the turbine exhaust gas. The mass flow\nrate mr of the turbine exhaust gas, in turn, can be reduced by increasing the turbo-\npump efficiency, the turbine inlet temperature, and the turbine pressure ratio p./po\n(see Sect. 4.3). For a staged-combustion cycle, the turbine inlet temperature and the\nturbo-pump efficiency have a direct effect upon the engine mass and the delivered\npayload. High turbine and pump efficiencies reduce the required pump discharge\npressure and also reduce the engine system mass. A high turbine inlet temperature,\nwithin the limits of the materials of which the turbine is made, also decreases the\nrequired pump discharge pressure and the engine mass [12].\n",

The remaining two are inert substances (liquid nitrogen and water),\nwhich are cited here because they are used to calibrate pumps. The physical properties\nindicated in the table are temperature T (K), vapour pressure p, (N/m7?), density\n(kg/m?), and coefficient of dynamic viscosity 4 (Ns/m*).

This fact causes gradients of temperature, which in turn pose problems\nof thermal expansion or contraction of the materials of which the pumps and the\nturbines are made.\n\nA structural method or a mechanical method can be adopted to ensure unrestrained\nthermal growth of the turbine casing, as will be shown below.\n\nThe structural method uses a long cylinder for turbo-pump housing. This results in\nacone smaller in diameter on the chilled side and larger in diameter on the heated side.\nTheoretically, the temperature should be equal to ambient temperature somewhere\nalong this cone, and therefore the diameter at that location should remain constant.\nAt this point, the cylindrical housing is flanged and bolted onto the pump casing.\nThe ambient temperature interface solves the problem of differential thermal growth.\nThis method has been chosen for the Mark-29-fuel (liquid hydrogen) turbo-pump,\nwhich is illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12].

Since a rotodynamic pump operates at motor speed, then its efficiency\ndecreases as viscosity increases, due to the increased frictional losses within the\npump.\n\nAs has been shown by several authors (see, for example, [23-25]), the losses\nwhich affect the performance of a rotodynamic pump can be classified as follows\ne hydraulic losses, due to friction and vortex dissipation in all components (inlet\n\ncasing, impeller, diffuser, volute, and outlet casing) located between the suction\n\nflange and the discharge nozzle;\n\n\u00a2 mechanical losses, due to friction in the radial bearings, in the axial bearing, and\nin the shaft seals;\n\ne leakage losses, which are losses of capacity (m/s) through the running clearances\nbetween the rotating element and the static parts of the pump, due to differences\nof static pressure in the working fluid upstream and downstream of the impeller;\nand\n\ne disc friction losses, due to shear stresses arising on the two (front and rear) circular\nsurfaces of the disc-shaped impeller which rotates in the working fluid.\nAccording to Stepanoff [23], disc friction loss is by far the most important of all\n\nmechanical losses. Stepanoff also indicates the following equation to compute the\n\npower P, (W) absorbed by disc friction\n2nw*r\nPy = K\u2014\n5\n\nwhere K is a factor, whose value is determined experimentally, based on the Reynolds\n\nnumber, and w (rad/s) and r (m) are respectively the angular velocity and the radius\n\nof the impeller.\n\nSome liquid propellants, for example, liquid fluorine and hydrazine, are highly\nreactive chemically and thermally unstable above some temperatures. Therefore,\nwhen using such propellants, special care must be taken in choosing the materials of\nwhich a pump is made. This also holds with the seals, the bearings, and the insulation\nmaterials which protect the pump from the heat coming from the turbine.\n",

As has been shown in Sect. 4.3, the losses due to the\nresidual velocity of the gas can be reduced by selecting carefully the value of\nthe blade-to-gas velocity ratio U/Cp, where U (m/s) is the peripheral velocity of\nthe rotor blades, and Co (m/s) is the isentropic spouting velocity, which in turn\ndepends on the enthalpy drop per unit mass of the gas Ahr (J/kg) as follows:\nCo = (2Ahr)\u201d.

    "306": "4.8 Heads and Mass Flow Rates of Pumps 299\n\nThe performance of an individual rocket engine depends on its thrust, specific\nimpulse, mass flow rate, and oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio. Each engine is designed\nto operate at a performance level defined by the values of the quantities indicated\nabove. Another engine, even of the same type, may operate at performance parameters\nwhich are slightly different from the design values. When the deviations of the actual\nfrom the nominal performance values are greater than a few percent, then a rocket\nvehicle may be incapable of accomplishing its mission.\n\nThese deviations are due to several reasons. Sutton and Biblarz [30] have identified\nsome of them, which are specified below. Firstly, the unavoidable tolerances on the\nconstruction materials may alter the impingement of the propellants in the injector,\nand this change may affect the efficiency of the combustion process. Secondly, a\nchange in mixture ratio, even small, may cause an increase in unused propellant at\nthe end of the burn. The quantity of residual propellant ranges usually from 0.5 to 2%\nof the total quantity [31]. Thirdly, variations in either the composition or the storage\ntemperature of the propellants may induce changes in their density and viscosity.\nFourthly, regulator setting tolerances or changes in flight acceleration can also cause\ndeviations of the performance parameters from the design values.\n\nThe engine calibration system is a process which corrects an engine system, by\nadjusting the values of its parameters, in order to obtain the desired performance\nwithin the allowed limits of tolerance.\n\nThe engine components which need calibration are\ne hydraulic and pneumatic components, such as pumps, pipes, valves, expansion\n\njoints, etc.;\n\ne high-temperature components, such as thrust chamber, turbines, gas generators\nor pre-burners, etc.; and\n\u00a9 components for cryogenic propellants, such as pumps, valves etc.\n\nHydraulic and pneumatic components are tested by means of water flowing\nthrough them in flow benches. This makes it possible to determine their pressure\ndrops at rated conditions. Components operating at high temperatures are tested\nthrough hot firing. Likewise, components operating at low temperature are tested by\nusing cryogenic propellants or liquid nitrogen.\n\nThe engine properties are estimated by summing the corrected values of the pres-\nsure drops due to its individual components at the desired mass flow rates. In addition,\nthe actual measured mixture ratio si, /imy must be equal to the desired mixture ratio\n\nTwo methods can be employed to control the performance parameter of an engine.\nThe first of them uses an automatic system with feedback and a digital computer\nwhich controls the deviations of the parameters in real time. The other method uses\nan initial static calibration of the engine system. In particular, the pressures supplied\nto the propellants by means of the respective pumps (or by means of gases under\npressure, in case of gas-pressurised propellants) must be balanced against the pressure\ndrops and the pressure in the combustion chamber. This balancing is necessary in\norder for an engine to operate at the desired values of the mass flow rates and of the\noxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio o/f.\n",

The pump calibration curves\ncan only be drawn after obtaining data resulting from tests. Such tests are executed\nby varying the impeller diameter (impeller trimming) and the hydraulic resistances\nat the discharge, in order to obtain the properties required by engine system.\n\nThe volume flow rate of the propellants to either a gas generator or a pre-burner\nalso needs calibration. The power balance requires the power delivered at the turbine\nshaft to be equal to the sum of the power needed to drive the pumps and the power\nlosses in the bearings, seals, etc.\n\nIna system balance of a turbo-pump at the initial point of design, known quantities\n(such as engine type, pressure in the thrust chamber, expansion area ratio in the nozzle,\noxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio, and thrust) are combined with assumed quantities\n(such as pump efficiencies, turbine efficiencies, turbine pressure ratio, turbine inlet\ntemperature, and various indicators of engine performance), in order to predict the\nrequirements relating to the pump head rise, the pump flow rate, and the turbine flow\nrate. In making this balance, the power delivered to the turbine shaft is equated to all\nthe sources of power absorption, as has been shown above.\n\nA system balance of a turbo-pump is also necessary at the final point of design.\nThis is because refinements and changes, which may be made in the detailed design\nof a rocket engine, can affect the turbo-pump operation. For example, during the\ndevelopment of the engine of the MA-5 sustainer, the efficiencies of the pumps and\nof the turbine were found, when tested, below the initial values assumed for them in\nthe design balance of the engine system. This fact required changes to increase the\n",
    "308": "4.8 Heads and Mass Flow Rates of Pumps 301\nvalue of the turbine drive pressure available from the gas generator, in order for the\nengine to meet its rated thrust values.\n\nAn off-design operating condition of a turbo-pump may be more demanding for\na particular component than the nominal design condition. Consequently, the whole\noperating range of a rocket engine is to be considered carefully. Otherwise, a pump\nwhich operates satisfactorily in design conditions may perform unsatisfactorily or\neven fail in off-design conditions.\n\nIn order to define the actual operating range of a turbo-pump, it is necessary\nto determine the planned operating range. Then, a system balance including the\npredicted operating characteristics of the turbo-pump is used to determine the whole\nrange of operation over the planned engine throttling and the variation of the oxidiser-\nto-fuel mixture ratio. For this purpose, it is necessary to take account not only of the\nordinary variations in the operating conditions, but also of the variations due to\nmanufacturing tolerances. This requires the availability of data on known tolerances\nof components from existing liquid-propellant engines. These data are used to esti-\nmate tolerances on hydraulic resistance of lines, valves, and passage channels of the\ncoolant in the nozzle, tolerances on the head rise/flow rate and efficiency/flow rate\ncurves of the pump, etc.\n\nThe tolerances on all the components are assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.\nThe effects of these tolerances are treated statistically, by taking the square root of\nthe sum of the squares of the effects of all the components. The effect of each\ncomponent is determined either by performing an engine balance assuming that the\ngiven component is at one of the extreme points of its range of tolerance, or by\nlinearising the equations which govern the engine system in order to determine the\ninfluence coefficients for each of the components considered.\n\nThe control points used for regulating the thrust and the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture\nratio can affect the discharge pressure of the turbo-pump and therefore its system\ndesign. Either calibration orifices or a pressure regulator have been used to control\neither the gas flow rate from the gas generator to the turbine or the oxidiser flow rate\nto the gas generator. For the J-2, F-1, and H-1 rocket engines, calibration orifices\nhave been used in the turbine-gas generator lines to set the power level. For the\nRL10 engine, heated fuel (hydrogen) has been used to control the turbine power. For\nthis purpose, the fuel was heated by passing through the cooling jacket of the thrust\nchamber before being ducted to the turbine through a control system which sensed\nthe thrust chamber pressure and adjusted a turbine bypass valve. By contrast, the\nMA-5 and MB-S rocket engines used a pressure regulator to control the flow of the\noxidiser to the gas generator.\n\nThe control of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio has been obtained by using either\nthe main propellant valves or a valve controlling the bypass of a propellant around\nits pump. The engine of the MA-5 sustainer used the control of the main propellant\nvalves, whereas the J-2 engine used a control valve around the oxidiser pump to\nregulate the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio.\n\nEngines which use orifices in the gas generator feed lines for thrust calibration\nor a turbine bypass for mixture ratio regulation are subject to large changes in thrust\nlevel, and therefore in pump discharge pressure, when their mixture ratio is varied.\n",

For this\npurpose, it is possible to use design or experimental data on pump head coefficient\nvw, impeller vane coefficient \u00a2,, and impeller loss due to leakage q, (m/s).

Typical\ndesign values of c,,2 range from 0.01 wz to 0.15 uz [22].\n\nThe diameter d, (m) of the impeller at the point of entrance of the vanes depends\non the design of the inducer, on the diameter of the impeller shaft, and on the diameter\nof the impeller hub.\n\nThe tip velocity uw (m/s) of the impeller blades at the impeller exit can be computed\nby means of the equation y = go AH /u5, for given values of the head rise AH (m)\nand of the head coefficient y.

The\nangle 6, should be made equal or close to the inlet flow angle 6.

A cast aluminium alloy is the proper choice for an inducer subject to\nlow stress when low cost is important.

For this purpose, the inlet flow is mixed with high-velocity fluid\ntaken from the pump discharge. This flow is injected through a ring of orifices in\nan axial direction upstream of the inducer. Pre-whirl introduced in this manner has\nimproved flow distribution and reduced flow instabilities which may occur when a\npump is throttled [4].\n\nBackflow occurs in an inducer at low flow (about 90% or less of the design value)\nas a result of local head breakdown in the tip region of the vanes. In order to reduce\nbackflow or control its effects, a backflow deflector can be incorporated in the inlet\nline, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [4].\n",

Above nominal flow,\nthe deflector has a detrimental effect [4]. Further information on backflow control\ncan be found in [35].\n\nAs a practical application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to design\nan inducer and an impeller for a centrifugal-flow pump to be used for the oxidiser\n(liquid oxygen) in the engine of the first stage of a rocket. The design data are indicated\nbelow. The required head rise of the pump is AH = 893.1 m. The required volume\nflow rate of the pump is q = 0.7836 m?/s. The angular velocity of the pump shaft is\n@ = 733.0 rad/s. The specific speed of the pump is N = 0.7241. The required net\npositive suction head of the inducer is (VPSHR)ind = 17.68 m. The suction specific\nspeed of the pump is S = 13.61. The head coefficient of the pump is y = 0.46. The\ninducer has a varying hub diameter and a varying blade tip diameter, as has been\nshown for one of the three schemes illustrated above. The head coefficient of the\ninducer is Wing = 0.06. In the inducer, the ratio of the diameter of the hub to the\ndiameter of the tip is rg = d;,/d, = 0.3, and the ratio of the length to the diameter\nof the tip is Lj/d,; = 0.4. The maximum angle of attack at the tip of a vane of the\ninducer at the inlet is i = 0.06981 rad. The semi-aperture angle of the inducer at the\ntip of its blades is 0.1222 rad. The semi-aperture angle of the hub of the inducer is\n0.2443 rad. The solidity of the vanes of the impeller at the mean tip diameter tip is\nS, = 2.2. The volume flow rate due to the leakage loss of the inducer through the\nclearance at the tip is Gee = 0.032 q = 0.032 x 0.7836 = 0.02508 m?/s. The impeller\nchosen for this pump is of the radial-flow type with mixed-flow vanes at the impeller\nentrance, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [12], which illustrates the\nimpeller of the oxidiser pump used for the Atlas MA-5 booster.\n",

This method was used in the Mark 48-O (liquid\noxygen) turbo-pump, which was designed to achieve a balance of axial thrust between\nthe pump and the turbine. For this purpose, the back side of the pump impeller\ncontains a balance piston, which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy\nof NASA [37]. The rotating member of the balance piston is the rear shroud of\nthe impeller. To operate the piston, high-pressure liquid oxygen from the impeller\ndischarge passes through a high-pressure orifice located at the outer diameter of the\nimpeller into the balance piston cavity. From this cavity, the liquid oxygen passes\nthrough a low-pressure orifice near the impeller hub into the balance piston sump.\nFrom there, the liquid oxygen returns to the eye of the impeller through axial passages\nin the diffuser vanes and radial holes in the diffuser and inlet [38].\n",

For example, an unbalanced load toward the pump inlet causes a\nreduction in the high-pressure orifice gap and an increase in the low-pressure orifice\ngap. This, in turn, causes a reduction in the pressure force of the impeller rear shroud,\nintroducing a compensating load change [38].\n\nMaterials used for thrust balance systems are chosen taking account of their\ncompatibility with the propellant, strength at the required rotating speed, and safety\nin the event of an inadvertent rub.

For this purpose, such pumps have been used\nin the multi-stage configuration only. The head rise AH made available by a typical\nsingle-stage centrifugal-flow pump, when the pumped fluid is liquid hydrogen, is\nabout 19,800 m, which corresponds to a pressure rise Ap of about 70.85 x 9.807 x\n19,800 = 1.376 x 107 N/m?. This is due to the very low density p = 70.85 kg/m? of\nliquid hydrogen. When higher values then these are required for AH and Ap, then a\nmulti-stage axial-flow pump is chosen. A pump of the latter type makes it possible\nto obtain a head rise ranging from about 1520 to 2740 m for each stage [22].\n\nThe volume flow rate q of axial-flow pumps used for liquid hydrogen cannot be\nlower than about 0.347 m?/s, because the height of the rotor or stator vanes of such\npumps cannot be lower than about 12.7 mm, for manufacturing reasons. For values\ngreater than 0.347 m/s of volume flow rate and in the range from 9140 to 19,800 m\nof head rise, the design requirements of a liquid-hydrogen pump can be satisfied\nby either a single-stage centrifugal flow pump or a multi-stage axial flow pump. In\npractice, a centrifugal-flow pump for liquid hydrogen is chosen when the volume\nflow rate required is lower than 0.0158 m/s [22].\n\nThe following table, adapted from [2], indicates (in metric units) delivered volume\nflow rate (m/s), total head rise (m), rotational speed (rad/s), number of stages, and\n",

This\ntransfer of kinetic energy occurs by using aerofoil-shaped vanes.

For example, when the average\nvelocity c\u2019; (m/s) of the flow is assumed to be constant in all sections of the volute,\nthen the area Ay (m7) of each cross section of the volute is computed by using the\nfollowing equations\n\n,_ 94\n\no3= =\n\n2m Ag\n\nc, = K,(2goAH)?\nwhere @ (rad) is the central angle corresponding to the area Ay of interest, q (m/s)\nis the rated design volume flow rate of the pump, K,, is a design factor, whose value\nis determined experimentally and ranges from 0.15 to 0.55, AH (m) is the design\nhead rise of the pump, and go = 9.80665 m/s? is the acceleration of gravity near the\nsurface of the Earth.\n\nIncase of axial-flow pumps for liquid hydrogen, the design velocity of flow in the\nvolute ranges from 30.5 to 45.7 m/s [22]. The cross section of the volute has usually\na circular shape, due to the high pressure. The boil-off of liquid hydrogen is limited\nas far as possible by using high-quality thermal insulating materials applied to the\nexternal surface of the pump.\n\nIn an axial-flow turbo-pump, thrust bearings and compensating balance pistons\nare used to counteract the high axial thrust loads due to pressure forces and fluid\nmomentum changes in the pump and in the turbine [2].\n\nThe following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [36], shows the balance piston\nand bearing scheme chosen for the Mark 15-F turbo-pump.\n",

High-pressure fluid coming from\nthe pump discharge is introduced into the thrust balance system and flows through\nthe two variable orifices in series with a low-pressure area.\n\nWhen an axial thrust moves the rotor assembly toward the inducer of the pump,\nthen the balance piston closes the high-pressure orifice at the front seal rub and\nopens the low-pressure orifice at the rear seal rub, thereby reducing the pressure in\nthe control chamber placed between the two seal rubs. This reduction of pressure\ncounteracts the hydraulic axial thrust acting on the rotor assembly toward the inducer,\nand restrains the motion of the rotor assembly in that direction. Likewise, when a\nreverse axial thrust moves the rotor assembly towards the discharge of the pump, then\nthe balance piston opens the high-pressure orifice at the front seal rub and closes the\nlow-pressure orifice at the rear seal rub, thereby increasing the pressure in the control\nchamber placed between the two seal rubs. This increase in pressure counteracts the\nreverse axial thrust acting on the rotor assembly toward the discharge, and causes\nthe rotor assembly to return to its neutral position.

In practice, design isentropic velocity ratios for\ntwo-row turbines used in gas-generator and tap-off engine cycles (see Sect. 4.4) range\nfrom 0.1 to 0.4, and corresponding efficiencies vary from 35 to 65% [15]. Staged-\ncombustion and expander-cycle turbines reach efficiencies above 80%, because the\nlower values of the turbine system pressure ratio po/p. permit operation in a range of\nvelocity ratios corresponding to higher efficiency, as has been shown quantitatively\nin Sect. 4.8.\n\nPeripheral velocities U of current turbine blades vary from 305 to 457 m/s, and\nassociated inlet temperatures for liquid oxygen/RP-1 and for liquid oxygen/liquid\nhydrogen turbines range from 811 to 1089 K. Rocket engine turbines have been\noperated successfully without cooling at inlet temperatures of 1200 K [15].\n\nThe number of stages in a turbine of new design depends on the quantity of energy\npossessed by the unit mass of the working fluid and made available to the turbine.\nIt also depends on a compromise between a gain in turbine efficiency and the added\nmass due to the further turbine stages required to increase performance. In a study\nof staging, pressure ratios and enthalpies per unit mass are varied in several possible\nconfigurations, to determine the design point corresponding to the highest efficiency\nwith the smallest pitch diameter and the least number of stages. Current turbines are\nusually of the single-row or two-row axial type. This is due principally to size and\nmass restrictions affecting turbines used for rocket engines. Impulse-type staging is\nusually specified in turbines of new design with isentropic velocity ratios below 0.35.\nThese turbines operate with high-energy working fluids and at pressure ratios which\nraise the stage spouting velocity into the supersonic domain.

Turbines\ndeveloping powers equal to or greater than 373 kW, including the turbines for the\nJ-2, F-1, and M-1 engines, have shrouded blades [15]. The shroud forms frequently\nan integral part of the blade, and the shroud of each blade fits closely to the shroud\nof the contiguous blade, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [15], which\nillustrates an interlocking rubbing shroud, providing damping and resistance to blade\ntorsional motion.\n",

The roots of the blades may be either welded to the disc\nor attached to it by using dove-tail or fir-tree joints, as has been shown in Sect. 4.3.\n\nThe loads acting on the rotor blades of a turbine are due to the following causes.\nThe first cause is the centrifugal force acting on each blade. This force produces a\ntensile stress which reaches its maximum value at the root section of a blade. In order\nto reduce this stress, a blade can be tapered by making its section at the tip narrower\nthan its section at the root. In addition, the centres of mass of the sections of a blade\nat various radii do not belong to a radial line. Therefore, the centrifugal forces acting\nin these offset centres of mass of a blade generate bending moments, whose value is\nalso maximum at the root section of the blade.\n\nThe second cause is the bending moment due to the gas flow through the blades.\nThe momentum change of the gas flow generates a force, which has a radial compo-\nnent, which drives the turbine, and an axial component. This force, in turn, generates\na bending moment acting on the blade. For the purpose of determining this bending\nmoment, the force due to the momentum change of the flowing gas can be considered\nas acting at the mid-height of the blade.\n\nThe third cause is the bending moment due to a vibration force. This is because\nthe gas flow through the blades is not uniform, but varies periodically between a\nmaximum and a minimum value. The frequency of this force should not be equal\nto any of the natural frequencies of the blade, in order to avoid bending stresses of\nconsiderable magnitude. A careful design of the blades can offset part of the bending\nmoment due to the gas flow by using the bending moment due to the centrifugal\nforce.\n",

Their capacity depends on the\nnumber of balls used for them. This number is limited by the assembly method.

These values range from 1.6 x 10\u00b0 (for Conrad-type ball\nbearings and cylindrical roller bearings) to 2.06 x 10\u00b0 (for angular-contact ball\nbearings). The value of DN is proportional to the tangential velocity of the bearing\nat the inside diameter of the inner race. When the maximum allowable limit of DV\nis exceeded, then lubrication and cooling are insufficient, and the bearing may fail\ndue to overheating, contact wear, and fatigue. Since the value of DN is proportional\nto the shaft diameter, it depends on the bearing location.

This results\ngenerally in a smaller shaft diameter, and therefore the turbo-pump can be designed\nfor a higher speed. Sobin et al.

This practice has the advantage of eliminating a separate\nsystem of cooling and lubrication. A small quantity of the pumped propellant is bled\nfrom a region of high pressure of the pump, flows through the bearings, and re-enter\ninto a region of low pressure of the pump. For this purpose, the propellants must be\nthermally stable at the operating temperature, chemically inert with the materials of\nwhich the bearings are made, and sufficiently viscous.\n\nThe design data concerning the capacity to carry loads, the operating speed, and\nthe life in service possessed by bearings are usually specified by their manufacturers.\nTable II in [36] contains a summary of capabilities possessed by bearings used for\nturbo-pumps of liquid-propellant rocket engines. The required life in service for a\nturbo-pump ranges usually from | to 2 h [36]. Bearings are designed for this life\nservice by specifying a calculated Bjo fatigue life, including speed effects, which\nexceeds the turbo-pump life by an arbitrary arbitrary factor, whose value is usually\nset to 10. This value is chosen not only to prevent fatigue failures, but also to compen-\nsate for other unquantifiable life-reducing factors, such as the low lubricity of most\npropellants and coolants.

Therefore, only rotating seals are considered here.\n\nFollowing the criterion proposed by Zuk [44], these seals can be classified into the\n\nfollowing categories.\n\nThe first category include the seals which depend on the selection and control of\nthe sealing region. This category includes the following subcategories:\n\u00a9 positive rubbing contact seals, which in turn include mechanical face seals,\n\ncircumferential shaft riding seals, lip seals, and soft packing seals;\n\ne seals which operate at close clearances (ranging from 0.025 to 0.25 cm), which\nin turn include hydrodynamic seals, hydrostatic seals, and floating bushing seals;\nand\n\ne fixed clearance seals (where the seal is in the gap between the rotating shaft and\nthe stationary sleeve), which in turn include fixed bushing seals and labyrinth\nseals.\n\nThe second category includes the seals which depend on the control of properties\nof the fluid. This category includes the following subcategories:\n\u00a9 controlled heating and cooling seals; and\ne ferromagnetic seals.\n\nThe third category includes the seals which depend on the control of forces acting\non the fluid. This category includes the following subcategories:\n\u00a9 centrifugal seals;\n\ne screw pump seals; and\n\ne magnetic seals.\n\nThis section describes briefly only those of the seals indicated above which have\nmost frequently been used in turbo-pumps of rocket engines, according to the data\ngiven in Table 1 of [45].

The sealing ring is held in close vicinity\nof the seat by a mechanical spring. The sealing ring is allowed to move axially to\nfollow the axial motion of the seal seat, such as run-out. Anti-rotation lugs, not shown\nin the preceding figure, prevent sealing ring rotation. Relative motion of the sealing\nring and the stationary housing occurs across a secondary seal, which is shown as an\nO-ring in the preceding figure. The secondary seal may also be a piston ring, in case\nof high temperatures. The secondary seal fulfils the function of allowing the sealing\nring to track axial motions of the seal seat. Since it is practically impossible to locate\nthe seal seat to be perfectly perpendicular to the axis of rotation, then axial run-out\noccurs. In order to reduce the leakage due to this run-out, small axial movement of\nthe sealing ring is allowed. In other words, the spring forces the sealing ring against\nthe rotating seal seat to follow the run-out or wobble. The secondary seal and ring\nfunction may be combined into one integral unit, as shown on the right-hand side of\nthe preceding figure, where a bellows is used. The seal shown on the left is internally\npressurised. For this purpose, the pressurising fluid is located on the inner diameter\nof the seal and is separated from the low-pressure environment located at the outside\ndiameter. By so doing, the pressurising fluid cannot leak to the external environment.\nThe same seal is also pressure-balanced. At the primary sealing interface, leakage\noccurs and the pressure of the fluid decreases. In case of a laminar flow of a viscous\nfluid, the pressure decrease is linear, as shown in the preceding figure. The force\ndue to this pressure decrease is called the seal separating force. The spring force\nand a hydrostatic force, which act against the sealing ring, counterbalance the seal\nseparating force and hold the sealing ring against the seal seat.\n",

By system\nwe mean a collection of parts or elements or components which work together to\nattain an object. By dynamical system we mean a system whose behaviour changes\nwith time in response to an external stimulus or force. In case of an engine of a rocket\nvehicle, the object of the system is the generation of a thrust vector having the desired\nmagnitude and direction.\n\nA dynamical system has inputs (or signals coming in), outputs (or signals going\nout), and an internal processor which transforms inputs into outputs. The part of\na dynamical system which transforms inputs into outputs, that is, the processor of\nsignals, is also known as the plant. The plant is the part of a dynamical system which\nfulfils the function of receiving, handling, and emitting signals.\n\nA dynamical system is usually represented graphically by means of a block\ndiagram, in which lines indicate input or output signals, and boxes indicate the plant\nor other components of the system, as shown in the following figure.\n\nPROCESSOR\nINPUT SIGNALS OUTPUT SIGNALS\n\nIn case of a rocket vehicle, the success or the failure of the mission of the vehicle\ndepends on the outputs of the various components or subsystems of which the system\nis made. Therefore, a rocket vehicle belongs to a particular class of dynamical\nsystems, which are called controlled systems.\n\nControlled systems exist in several fields of engineering.

A control system is an arrangement of components connected one\nto another for the purpose of regulating the system itself or another system to be\ncontrolled by the first.\n\nA control system which cannot adjust itself or another system to input signals\nreceived is called an open-loop system. An open-loop system is shown in the\nfollowing figure, re-drawn from [1], which illustrates two systems which are\nconnected between them, because the output signals u of the first (controller) are\nalso the input signals of the second, which is the controlled system. Therefore, the\nfirst system controls the second system, but is not controlled by it. There is no mutual\ncontrol of one system over the other. In other words, a system whose output signal\ny has no effect upon the input to the control process is called an open-loop control\nsystem.\n\nAcontrol system which can adjust itself or another system to input signals is called\na closed-loop or feedback system. A closed-loop system is shown in the following\nfigure, re-drawn from [1], which illustrates two systems which have mutual control\none over the other.\n\nfume\n\nIn other words, a closed-loop control system is a control system in which some\nfunction of the output y of some part of the system is fed back as a secondary input\nwhich adds to the primary input r to the system, so as to affect the response of\nthe system itself. As an example of a control system for a rocket vehicle, Lorenzo\nand Musgrave [2] describe a pressure-fed bi-propellant engine, in which the propel-\nlants are kept under pressure in their respective tanks and then supplied to the main\ncombustion chamber through appropriate feed lines, control valves, and injector\nelements, as has been shown in Chap. 3. The propellants are to be delivered to the\nmain combustion chamber in a determined mixture ratio\n\nOo mM,\n\nfms\nwhere mz, and rity are the mass flow rates of respectively the oxidiser and the fuel,\nand at a total mass flow rate mm, = m, +m, related to the desired thrust. The control\nsystem of this rocket engine regulates the thrust by controlling the pressure p, of the\ngas in the combustion chamber and the mixture ratio o/f of the two propellants, as\nshown in the following figure, adapted from [2].\n",
    "456": "5.1 Fundamental Concepts on Control Systems 449\n-. O\nMixture\nRatio\nControl\nTeal my | P\nc\n%\nsupply\nChamber\nPressure\n(Thrust)\nControl\nPp\nc O\nset eZ -\n\nThe preceding scheme has two control loops. One of them controls the mixture\nratio o/f of the propellants, and the other controls the pressure p, of the gas in\nthe combustion chamber. The first loop operates usually, but not necessarily, on the\npropellant supplied at higher mass flow rate than the other. This loop is tuned to be the\nfast loop. This reduces excursions in the mixture ratio away from the set point, which\nin turn keeps the temperatures of the gas and of the metal at the design conditions.\nThe second loop, which controls the pressure of the gas in the combustion chamber,\nis the slow loop, and its bandwidth is set by thrust response requirements. The type of\ncontrol shown above requires three measurements (p\u00a2, 7, and my) and two control\ninputs for the valve areas A, and A, [2].\n\nAn open-loop control system for a rocket engine is calibrated to a fixed set of\nconditions, and uses orifices and on-off command devices to correct deviations of\nsome parameters from their design values. For example, orifices of proper size are\ninserted into the flow lines to command pressure drops, and the mass flow rates of the\npropellants are controlled by opening or closing valves. An open-loop control system\nis simple, but is also limited to a specific set of parameters, and cannot compensate\nfor variable conditions. The sequence times in an open-loop control system are often\nestablished by means of interlocks.\n",
    "457": "450 5 Control Systems and Valves\nA closed-loop control system uses sensors, computers to detect errors (which are\ndifferences between a given reference signal r and the output y of the system), and\nactuation commands u generated by the computers to correct the errors. Therefore, a\nclosed-loop control system does not require calibration for a specific set of conditions.\nIt requires sensors and computers to detect errors and take appropriate steps to correct\nthem. A closed-loop control system is often used in a rocket engine to control the\nmixture ratio o/f of the propellants, and the thrust vector F in magnitude and direction.\nA closed-loop control system in a rocket engine may operate in one of the modes\nindicated below.\n(1) On-off control, which can be described as follows:\nua | timax ife>0\n~ | umin if e < 0\nwhere the control error e = r \u2014 y is the difference between the reference signal\nr and the output y of the system, and uw is the actuation command. The preceding\nequation does not define a value of the actuation command u when the control\nerror e is equal to zero. In practice, u is taken equal to zero (u = 0) when the\ncontrol error e is in a narrow band centred around e = 0. The on-off control is\nused for a rocket engine, for example, when a pressure switch opens or closes\na valve which regulates the pressure in a tank.\n(2) Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, which can be described as\nfollows:\nUmax if @ > max\nu=ykpe if emin < @ < @max\nUmin if e < emin\nwhere k, is the controller gain, @min = Umin/kp, and @max = Umax/kp.\nThe interval (\u20acmin, @max) is called the proportional band, because the behaviour of\nthe controller is linear when the error e = r \u2014 y is in this interval, as follows\nu=k,(r\u2014y)=kpe if emin < @ < \u20acmax\nIn a proportional control, the process variable often deviates from a reference\nvalue. When some level of the control signal u is required for the system to maintain\na desired value, then the control error e must be other than zero to generate the\nrequired value. For this purpose, the control signal u is made proportional to the\nintegral of the error over a given time interval, as follows\nt\nu(t) = k; | e(t)dt\n0\n",
    "458": "5.1 Fundamental Concepts on Control Systems 451\nwhere k; is the integral gain. This type of control is called integral control. A controller\nwith integral control has zero steady-state error [1].\n\nUnfortunately, there may not always be a steady state, because the system may be\nsubject to oscillations. In this case, a controller can be made able to predict the error e\nsome time Ty ahead of the present time f, by using the following linear extrapolation\n\nde\ne(t + Ty) \u00a9 e(t) + Ta \u2014\ndt\n\nBy combining proportional, integral, and derivative control, it is possible to obtain\na PID controller based on the following equation\n\nt\n\nde\n\nu(t) =kpe(t) +k | e(t)dt+ ka\n0\n\nBy so doing, the control signal u(t) results from the sum of three terms: the term\nrelating to the present time is proportional, through the coefficient k,, to the error\nat the present time; the term relating to the past time is proportional, through the\ncoefficient k;, to the error cumulated over an interval before the present time; and the\nterm relating to the future time is proportional, through the coefficient ky, to the error\nresulting from a linear extrapolation of the error at some time ahead of the present time\n[1]. The proportional-integral-derivative control is used for a rocket engine in several\ncases, for example, to control the pressure in the combustion chamber (proportional\nterm), or the mixture ratio of the propellants (integral term), or the direction of the\nthrust vector with phase lead (derivative term). An example of a closed-loop control\nsystem for a rocket engine has been given by Huzel and Huang [3] by means of the\nfollowing scheme, re-drawn from [3].\n\nG\n4 \u00a3 GG TURBOPUMP\nCOMMAND REFERENCE GG FLOW | fi p, [THRUST\nREFERENCE \u2014> PRESSURE }\u20141>(}\u2014>>1\u201co] contro [> Fremuesran NO LTS F\nPRESSURE p, | TRANSDUCER baad VALVE CHAMBER NOZZLE\nCHAMBER\nPRESSURE\nTRANSDUCER\n\u00ae ELECTRIC SUMMING JUNCTION\n> ELECTRIC AMPLIFIER\n\nThis control system illustrated above has the purpose of maintaining the value p.\nof the pressure in the combustion chamber equal to a desired value p, of reference, by\nusing a valve which controls the value m, of the mass flow rate in the gas generator\n(GG). The magnitude F of the thrust vector is controlled indirectly, by regulating the\npressure p, in the combustion chamber.\n",
    "459": "452 5 Control Systems and Valves\n\nThis control system consists of a sensor (chamber pressure transducer), a computer\ncontaining an electric summing junction and an electric amplifier, and a controller\n(gas generator flow control valve) which regulates the value of the mass flow rate m\nin the gas generator. The computer compares the reference input signal r with the\ninput signal y coming from the sensor (chamber pressure transducer). The signal r is\nrelated to the reference pressure p,, and the signal y is related to the actual pressure\nPc in the combustion chamber through differential equations, which describe the\nbehaviour of the components of the system.\n\nThe letters A, B, C, and D in the preceding figure indicate the relations existing\nbetween the input and the output of the respective components. The equations which\ngovern this control systems can be written symbolically as follows\n\nr= Ap,\ne=r-y\nMg = Be\nPc = Ciitg\ny= Dpc\n\nThe behaviour of this control system results from the solution of the preceding\nequations. These equations are usually solved by using the method of the Laplace\ntransformation (see, for example, [4]). The values to be given to the gains and to the\nresponse lags of a control system are to be chosen carefully, sometimes by trial and\nerror, in order not to introduce overshoots or other causes of instability, which could\ngive rise to large oscillations.\n\n5.2. Control Systems for Rocket Engines\n\nThe control systems described in general terms in the preceding section are used in\n\nliquid-propellant rocket engines to perform some or all of the following tasks:\n\ne engine start;\n\ne engine shutdown;\n\n\u00a9 engine restart, in case of engines having restart capability;\n\n\u00a9 execution of a given plan of operation;\n\ne change of the given plan of operation, or even engine shutdown, in the presence\nof a malfunction;\n\n\u00a2 propellant tank filling up;\n",

This sequence includes the steps of preparation (thrust chamber purging and\nchill-down of propellant transfer lines), application of start energy (start tanks and\nturbine spinner), and introduction followed by ignition of the propellants in the main\ncombustion chamber. Secondary start sequences may be needed for some subsystems,\nas is the case with a gas generator or a pre-burner. A start sequence is regulated by\nmeans of interlocks, and by monitoring each step of the sequence. The opening\nsequence of the propellant valves may perform either an oxidiser-lead or a fuel-lead\nstart, depending on the combination of propellants chosen, on the method used to\nignite the propellants, and on the method used to cool the thrust chamber. The start\ndelay time is the time necessary to purge the engine, open the valves, initiate the\ncombustion, and increase the pressure in the combustion chamber to the rated value.\nThis time is usually small (from 0.003 to 0.015 s in small thrusters) for an engine\nfed by gas under pressure, in which the pressurisation system has to be activated and\nthe ullage volume has to be put under pressure before the start. An engine fed by\nturbo-pumps requires more time to start (from | to 5 s), because it is necessary not\nonly to execute the operations indicated above for a pressure-fed engine, but also to\nstart a gas generator or a pre-burner, and to increase the speed of the turbo-pumps\nto a level in which the combustion can be firstly self-sustained and then brought to\nits full extent. When the combination of propellants used in a rocket engine is not\nhypergolic, additional time is necessary for the igniter to work and for the control\nfunction to confirm the proper operation of the igniter. The ignition methods used\nfor liquid-propellant rocket engines have been discussed in Chap. 2, Sects. 2.7 and\n2.8.\n\nThe shutdown sequence is executed either in normal operating conditions or in\ncases of emergency. This is done by shutting off the flow to the gas generator (or\nto the pre-burner) and to the main combustion chamber. In case of test firings, the\nshutdown sequence also includes purges and flushes for post-firing safety. The control\nsystem regulates the valve closing sequence in such a way as to provide a fuel-rich\ncut-off in the main combustion chamber. This prevents high picks of temperature and\n",

The valve controlling the gas generator or the pre-burner closes first. The\npressurisation in the propellant tanks is stopped. The pumps slow down, as a result\nof the decrease in the gas flow through the turbine. The pressures and the mass flow\nrates of the propellants decrease quickly and reduce to zero.\n\nIn the three main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, the characteristics of\nstart, run, and shutdown are established by the combined actions of the main fuel\nvalve, the main oxidiser valve, the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve, the fuel pre-\nburner oxidiser valve, and the chamber coolant valve. These valves are powered\nby hydraulic actuators which receive positioning signals from the engine controller,\nwhich in turn uses performance data gathered by sensors located throughout the\nengine.

This action maintains the appropriate\n",

During engine run, the oxidiser\npre-burner oxidiser valve and the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve are used as control\ndevices for thrust and mixture ratio. Manipulating the valves affects the output of\nthe pre-burners, the speed of the turbo-pumps, and therefore the propellant flow\nrates. The fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve is driven alone to maintain mixture ratio\nin the main combustion chamber, while the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve is\ndriven with the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve to increase or decrease thrust while\nmaintaining the mixture ratio. The control loops include the controller, the valve\nactuators, and the transducers which sense the flow rates and the pressure in the main\ncombustion chamber, and therefore the thrust. During the engine shutdown phase,\nall five valves are switched to shutdown schedules. These schedules ensure a smooth\nand safe shutdown by establishing a fuel lag. In other words, the oxidiser leaves\nthe combustion chambers ahead of the fuel. This lag creates a fuel-rich and cool\nshutdown environment [7].\n\nThe controller of the RS-25 engine provides complete and continuous moni-\ntoring and control of engine operation. In addition, it performs maintenance and start\npreparation checks, and collects data for historical and maintenance purposes.

Fail-operate mode follows a first failure, and\nis similar to normal mode, but with a loss of some redundancy. Fail-safe mode\nfollows a second failure. In this mode, engine throttling and mixture ratio control\nare suspended, the main propellant valves are held fixed in their last commanded\nposition, and the engine is subsequently shutdown pneumatically. The controller\nprovides active and continuous control of the engine thrust and of the mixture ratio\nin the main combustion chamber through closed-loop control. The controller reads the\npressure (equivalent to the thrust) in the main combustion chamber, and compares it\nto the existing thrust reference signal. It uses the error to drive the oxidiser pre-burner\noxidiser valve, which adjusts the thrust and eliminates the error. For the mixture ratio\nin the main combustion chamber, the controller reads the fuel flow-meter and drives\nthe fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve to adjust the fuel flowing to the main combustion\nchamber, thus maintaining a mixture ratio o/f = 6. In addition to these primary\nfunctions, the controller performs engine checkout, limit monitoring, start readiness\nverification, and engine start and shutdown sequencing. The controller instructions\nto the engine control elements are updated 50 times per second (every 20 ms). The\nelectronics are mounted on modular boards inside a sealed and pressurised chassis,\nwhich is cooled by heat convection through pin fins [7].\n\n5.3, Control of Thrust Magnitude\n\nThe thrust of a rocket engine is controlled in magnitude by regulating the pressure\nin the main combustion chamber. Sometimes, a reduction of the thrust magnitude,\nalso known as throttling, is necessary in the last part of the propelled flight of a\nrocket vehicle. This reduction can be performed by decreasing, either stepwise or\ncontinuously, the pressure in the main combustion chamber.\n\nIncase of rocket engines fed by turbo-pumps, the pressure in the main combustion\nchamber can be reduced by regulating either the mass flow rate of the propellants\nthrough the gas generator or the mass flow rate of the hot gas through the turbine.\nWhen the first method is used, it is also possible to vary the mixture ratio of the\npropellants.\n\nIn case of rocket engines fed by gases under pressure, the pressure in the combus-\ntion chamber can be reduced by regulating the pressures in the main tanks of the\npropellants.\n\nIn case of multiple engines arranged in a cluster, thrust control can be performed\nby shutting off one or more engines of the cluster.\n\nThe examples of thrust regulation considered in Sect. 5.1 concern the case of a\nrocket engine fed by gases under pressure and the case of a rocket engine fed by\nturbo-pumps. In the second case, the thrust has been controlled in magnitude by\nusing a valve regulating the value of the mass flow rate in the gas generator, and\ntherefore the power delivered by the turbine.\n",

A chamber pressure transducer senses the pressure\nPc in the combustion chamber, which is used as an indicator of the thrust magnitude.\nThe output signal y of the chamber pressure transducer is fed back as a secondary\ninput to the thrust throttle control computer, which compares the signal y with its\nprimary input, which is the reference signal r. The error e = r \u2014 y is used to drive\nthe thrust throttle control actuator, which in turn regulates the control valves of the\npropellants in such a way as to reduce the error.\n\nIn the RS-25 engine, throttling is accomplished by varying the output of the pre-\nburners, thus varying the speed of the high-pressure turbo-pumps, and therefore the\nmass flow rates of the propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen). The mixture\nratio of the propellants in the main combustion chamber is o/f = 6.032. This value\nis maintained by varying the fuel flow rate around the oxidiser flow rate [7]. In\nother words, restricting the oxidiser flow to the pre-burners causes the turbine inlet\ntemperature to decrease.\n",
    "465": "458 5 Control Systems and Valves\n5.4 Control of Propellant Mixture Ratio\n\nAn open-loop control system of the mixture ratio of the propellants in a rocket engine\ncan be obtained by installing calibration orifices of proper size in the propellant lines.\nFurther refinements are possible by weighing accurately the propellants loaded in the\ntanks, by using orifices of adjustable (rather than fixed) size in case of storable fluids,\nin order to regulate the size of the orifices just before take-off, and by installing valves\nat the pump inlet of engines fed by turbo-pumps, in order to compensate for effects\ninduced by accelerations acting on the fluid mass. In the last manner, an increase\nor decrease in pressure in the fluids due to variable accelerations is sensed and fed\nback to a closed-loop control system, which regulates gradually the valves and also\nprotects the pumps.\n\nIn certain cases, it is necessary to perform a continuous control of the mixture\nratio by using a closed-loop system. In such cases, Huzel and Huang [3] suggest the\ncontrol scheme shown in the following figure.\n\nCOMMAND REFERENCE\n\nMIXTURE RATIO\n\nINPUT, (mo/m,), RUT\n\nCONTROL\n= 1\nCONTROL COMPUTER\nFUEL FLOW, Yep (ality Xe pli\nm FLOWMETER a VALVE VERNIER VALVE\nPOSITION ACTUATOR\nOXIDISER FLOW\nFLOWMETER to\n\n\u00ae ELECTRIC SUMMING JUNCTION\n[> evectaic AMPLIFIER\n\nThe control system illustrated in the preceding figure has two flow-meters which\nsense continuously the mass flow rates m, and m, of the propellants.

A volumetric flow-\nmeter (such as a positive displacement flow-meter) measures the volume flow rate\nq = Av of a fluid stream which passes through a cross-sectional area A (m7) at a\nvelocity v (m/s).

A brief account is given below.\n\nSensors detecting the presence of fluids of a given type at given locations in a\ntank are usually called wet-dry sensors. Most wet-dry sensors are based on a hot\nwire or an electrical resistance or an electrical impedance element which carries a\nsmall current. The presence of a given type of fluid at the sensor location is detected\nby a change in the electrical impedance of the sensor, which in turn depends on the\ntype of fluid (gas or liquid) around the sensor. This is because the sensor impedance\ndepends on the amount of heat transfer from the sensor to the surrounding medium,\ndue to the heating caused by the passage of the electric current. The heat transfer is\ngreater when the sensor is surrounded by a liquid. Thus, by measuring a change in\ncurrent for a constant applied voltage or a change in voltage for a constant applied\ncurrent, it is possible to detect whether the sensor is in a liquid or in a gas.\n\nAnother type of sensor is based on a laser light source incorporated in a prism-like\ncapsule, whose index of refraction is matched to the index of refraction of the liquid\ncontained in a tank. A scheme of this optical sensor is shown in the following figure,\ndue to the courtesy of NASA [10].\n",
    "468": "5.5 Control of Propellant Consumption 461\nLight source Liquid\nGas __ \\\n==\nPrism ff\nPhotocell ~\n\nWhen the sensor is immersed in a gas, as shown on the left-hand side of the\npreceding figure, the light is reflected off the end of the prism back to a photocell\nat the light source. By contrast, when the sensor is immersed in a liquid, as shown\non the right-hand side of the preceding figure, the light is transmitted through the\nliquid without reflection off the prism. Thus, the presence or absence of a reflection\nindicates whether the sensor is dry or wet.\n\nSensors which detect the location of the surface of a liquid in a tank or the depth\nof this liquid above the sensor are called level sensors. In this category are pressure\nsensors, ultrasonic sensors, and electrical capacity sensors.\n\nPressure sensors cannot be used in weightless conditions, because they measure\nthe pressure head p/(pgo) of the liquid placed above the location of the sensor. A\npressure transducer is inserted at the bottom of a gauge line going from the bottom\nto the top of a tank. A pressure sensor detects the difference of pressure existing\nbetween the gas at the top and the liquid at the bottom of the tank. This difference\nis related to the depth of the liquid when the pressure and the temperature of the\nsubstance (liquid or gas) are known.\n\nUltrasonic sensors generate an ultrasonic pulse which is transmitted through the\nliquid propellant contained in a tank. A mismatch of acoustic impedance at the liquid-\ngas interface generates an echo, which is transmitted back through the liquid to an\nultrasonic receiver at the transducer location. The time elapsed between the emission\nof the pulse and the reception of the echo is related to the depth of liquid above the\ntransducer by the sonic velocity in the liquid. A sensor of this type can be used in low-\ngravity conditions, but the liquid must be maintained in a known configuration above\nthe sensor by a propellant management device based on the principle of capillarity.\n\nAn ultrasonic sensor of another type is a torsional wave guide. In this sensor, the\nspeed of a torsional wave propagating along a wave guide, such as a rod, depends on\nwhether the wave guide is immersed in a liquid or ina gas. The impedance mismatch at\nthe liquid-gas interface generates an echo, which is detected to provide information\non the length of the wave guide which is immersed in the liquid. However, some\ntests executed in conditions of zero gravity have shown that the adherence of liquid\nto portions of the wave guide supposed to be dry degraded seriously the accuracy of\nthe sensor.\n\nA capacity sensor contained in a propellant tank is shown in the following figure,\ndue to the courtesy of NASA [11].\n",

The sensing probe consists essentially of\ntwo coaxial tubes contained in a tank. These tubes, when a voltage is applied to\nthem, act as the plates of an electric condenser, whose capacity changes when the\nproportion between liquid and gas changes. This is because the liquid and the gas\ncontained in the tank have different values of dielectric constant. In other words,\nthe dielectric medium between the two tubes of the probe is the propellant, in liquid\nand gaseous state, contained in the tank. The total electrical capacity of the probe\ndepends on the level of the liquid which fills it. Thus, the measured electrical capacity\nof the probe provides information on the mass of liquid in the tank. With a suitable\nelectronic apparatus, the mass of the residual propellant in the tank can be measured\ncontinuously. The outer tube of the capacity probe may be perforated or not, as shown\nin the preceding figure. A non-perforated probe was chosen for the Centaur launch\nvehicle, because it provided a better measurement [11].\nA propellant management system using electrical capacity probes was also chosen\nfor the J-2 engine in the S-IVB stage, as shown in the following figure, due to the\ncourtesy of NASA [12].\n",

During flight, the electrical capacity probes are not used to control the\npropellant mixture ratio. The mixture ratio is controlled by switch selector outputs,\nwhich are used to operate the propellant utilisation (PU) valve. The PU valve is a\nrotary valve which controls the quantity of liquid oxygen flowing to the engine. The\nPU valve is commanded to its null position to obtain an engine mixture ratio (EMR)\nof 5.0:1 prior to engine start. The PU valve remains at the 5.0:1 position during the\nfirst burn. Prior to engine restart (first opportunity), the PU valve is commanded by\nthe switch selector to an EMR of 4.5:1 and remain at this position until approximately\n",
    "471": "464 5 Control Systems and Valves\n2 min of S-IVB burn. Then the PU valve is commanded to its null position (5.0:1) by\nthe switch selector. However, if the S-IVB restart is delayed to the second opportunity,\nthe EMR is shifted from 4.5:1 to 5.0:1 by the switch selector at about the time in\nwhich the engine reaches 90% thrust [12].\n\nAn electrical capacity probe depends on the liquid being settled, and therefore can\nonly be used for gauging during periods of thrusting [10]. In principle, an electrical\ncapacity probe might be used in low-gravity conditions if the liquid configuration is\ncontrolled by propellant management devices. However, in such conditions, capillary\nforces in the annular gap between the walls of the probe would cause the liquid\nmeniscus location to differ from the liquid level in the tank, and thus cause an\ninaccurate reading, which may be small and could be compensated for. Depending\non the design, the probe can also be sensitive to liquid motions such as occurred with\nthe first landing of the Lunar Module on the Moon, for which non-linear sloshing\nlowered the effective level of the liquid within the gauge to the point that a premature\nlow liquid level warning was given [10].\n\nIn the absence of a specific measurement system, the quantity of propellant\nremaining in a tank can be estimated by determining the consumption of the propel-\nlants which have already been used in comparison with the quantity initially loaded in\nthe tanks. This method is commonly called bookkeeping. Some sensors and devices\nare used in the bookkeeping method, either separately or in conjunction. They are:\ne flow-meters or Venturi-meters in the lines between the tanks and the main\n\ncombustion chamber or the gas generator to measure the flow rates of the\n\npropellants;\n\ne sensors which determine the flow rates of the propellants by measuring their\npressures in the pumps in conjunction with the performance curves of the pumps;\nand\n\n\u00a9 calibrations of engine thrust versus propellant flow rate and tank pressure.\nVarious types of flow-meters, turbine-meters, accelerometers, and pressure\n\nsensors are required for the bookkeeping method. This method can only be used\nduring periods of engine thrusting, and its accuracy is limited by the accumula-\ntion over time of the errors committed in estimating the propellant consumption, in\nparticular near the point of propellant depletion. In addition, the bookkeeping method\ncannot detect leaks.\n\nOther methods indicated by Dodge [10] to evaluate propellant consumption are:\ne measuring the acceleration of the vehicle and the thrust of the engine, in order to\n\ndetermine the mass of the vehicle at any given time in comparison with the mass\n\nof the empty vehicle; and\n\n\u00a9 measuring the decay of pressure in the ullage spaces, in case of tanks which are\ninitially pressurised, as the liquids are drained from their tanks and the ullage\nspaces increase.\n",

The principal components used for this\npurpose are valves, pressure regulators, and flow-meters. They are described here\nand in the following sections.\n\nA simple analysis of flow control devices can be done by considering firstly\nthe motion of an ideal fluid, and then the corrections which are necessary to take\naccount of the behaviour of real fluids. For example, a liquid can be considered\ninviscid, incompressible, and moving in laminar flow (see below) through a tube. The\nBernoulli principle, so called after the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli, applies to\nthis case. According to this principle, the total energy (potential energy plus pressure\nenergy plus kinetic energy) possessed by an ideal fluid in steady motion between any\ntwo cross sections | and 2 of a tube is constant.\n\nBy considering the total energy per unit weight, the Bernoulli principle can be\nexpressed as follows\n\n2 2\n\ngt ee yg a pp PY\n\nps0 280 P80 280\nwhere z (m) is the elevation of the chosen point with respect to a reference plane,\np (N/m?) is the absolute pressure in the fluid in the chosen point, p (kg/m?) is the\ndensity of the fluid in all points at the given temperature, g9 = 9.80665 m/s? is the\nacceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth, and v (m/s) is the velocity of\n\nthe fluid in the chosen point along a stream line.\n\nWhen the flow takes place at a constant elevation, then z} = z2, and therefore the\n\npreceding equation may be written as follows\n",

Two pressure taps are placed one at the inlet of the convergent cone and the\nother at the throat. A Venturi-meter is based on the Bernoulli principle. When the\ncross-sectional area of the tube decreases from the inlet plane to the throat, then\nthe pressure head p/(pgo) of the fluid is forced to decrease, and its velocity head\nv?/(2go) is forced to increase, in order for its total head to be constant.

As has been shown in Chap. 4,\nSect. 4.7, viscosity is a physical property which measures the degree of internal\nresistance opposed by a fluid to motion. The fluids for which the rate of deformation\nis proportional to the shear stress applied to them are called Newtonian fluids, after\nIsaac Newton. In case of a one-dimensional motion of a Newtonian fluid along a\ndirection x (planar Couette flow), this linear relationship can be expressed as follows\n\ndv\nTry = KD\nwhere Ty (N/m?) is the shear stress, dvidy (s~!) is the rate of shear strain, that is,\nthe velocity gradient in the direction y perpendicular to the direction x of motion,\nv = v(y) (m/s) is the velocity of motion in the direction x, and (Ns/m?) is the\ncoefficient of dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe motion of a viscous fluid in a cylindrical tube may be either laminar or\nturbulent or transitional.

    "480": "5.7 Principal Components of Flow Control Systems 473\nare stationary, whereas the internal layers move by sliding one over another. The\nvelocity of the layers increases from the walls to the central line of the tube with a\nparabolic profile.\n\nBy contrast, a viscous fluid in turbulent flow regime (right) moves irregularly with\neddies and swirls which mix the layers of fluid together. The mean velocity profile\nfor turbulent flow is approximately elliptic (blunt nose) and is characterised by a\nmuch higher shear stress, due to the slope of the velocity profile at the walls [17].\nEven in conditions of turbulent flow, a thin layer (called boundary layer) exist near\neach wall of the tube where the fluid moves in laminar flow regime.\n\nA transitional flow fluctuates between laminar flow and turbulent flow. When this\nhappens, a laminar flow is on the verge of becoming turbulent.\n\nA criterion to indicate whether the motion of a fluid occurs in laminar or turbulent\nflow is provided by the value of the Reynolds number. As has been shown in Chap. 2,\nSect. 2.5, the Reynolds number Re is defined as follows\n\nRe= pvd\nbh\n\nwhere p (kg/m?) is the density of the fluid at the given temperature, v (m/s) is the\nmean velocity of the fluid in the tube, d (m) is the hydraulic diameter of the tube,\nand yz (N s m~\u201d) is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity of the fluid at the given\ntemperature. The Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous\nforces which act on a unit volume of fluid moving in a tube. For low values of the\nReynolds number, the viscous forces are sufficiently high to keep the fluid particles in\nparallel layers, and consequently the flow is laminar. For high values of the Reynolds\nnumber, the inertial forces prevail over the viscous forces, and consequently the flow\nis turbulent. For practical purposes, when the value of the Reynolds number is less\nthan 2000, then the flow is laminar. The transition value for a fluid moving in a tube of\ncircular cross section is Re = 2300. When the value of the Reynolds number ranges\nfrom about 2300 and 4000, then the flow is unstable, due to an incipient turbulence.\nWhen the value of Re is greater than 4000, then the flow is turbulent.\n\nThe friction forces acting on the particles of a fluid moving in a tube are due to the\nrubbing of the particles one against another and also against the walls of the tube. As\na result of these forces, part of the kinetic energy possessed by the fluid is converted\ninto heat. This heat may either remain into the fluid or be transferred to the external\nenvironment through the walls.\n\nAs has also been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.5, the drop of pressure head AH, (m)\ndue to friction in a tube of length L (m) and hydraulic diameter d (m) is expressed\nas a function of the Darcy friction factor fp (dimensionless) of the tube by means of\nthe Darcy-Weisbach equation, as follows\n\nL( v?\nAH), = fo \u201c()\n",

Static seals (such as O-ring seals and gaskets) for stationary surfaces are\nalso considered here. The dynamic seals used for turbo-pumps of rocket engines\nhave been described in Chap. 4, Sect. 4.13.\n\nThe leakage from a valve may be either internal leakage, which occurs in the direc-\ntion of the flow, or external leakage, which occurs from a valve to the external environ-\nment, in a direction which differs from the normal direction of the flow. According to\nHowell and Weathers [25], the factors affecting the leakage requirements for valves\nare:\n\u00a2 loss of pressure or loss of propellant, to be prevented or kept below an acceptable\n\nvalue in order to avoid system failure due to premature depletion of fluid;\n\ne damage to the system, such as corrosion or fire, which might occur as a result of\nleakage of propellants;\n\ne damage to personnel, which may occur in case of leakage of fluids which are toxic\nfor inhalation or exposure; and\n\ne interference with experiments, which might occur in case of gases under pressure\nor propellants enveloping a spacecraft whose mission is to sample the atmosphere\nof a planet.\n\nThe following seals are considered here:\n\ne seals for valves operating at high pressures and temperatures; and\ne seals for valves operating at cryogenic temperatures.\n\nBurmeister et al. [26] have made a survey on the matter. A brief account of this\nsurvey is given below. Valves for rocket engines operate at pressures ranging from\nzero to 6.895 x 108 N/m\u2019, and at temperatures ranging from cryogenic values to\nover 1366 K.

A plug valve can be operated in an intermediate\nposition, in order to throttle the flow. Simple quarter-turn valves, such as the one\nshown in the preceding figure, are limited in high-pressure application by the rapid\nincrease in operating torque with increasing difference of pressure.

The lubricant may be washed away by the\nfluid when unseating the plug, or may also be extruded by the difference of pressure.\nThe three functions fulfilled by the lubricant (lubrication, plug unseating, and viscous\nsealing) are combined in plug valves of the Nordstrom type, such as the valve shown\nin the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26].\n",

Commercial valves of this type are available for pressures\nup to 1.034 x 108 N/m? at atmospheric temperatures, and also for pressures of\n0.3447 x 108 N/m? at a temperature of 922 K [26].\n\nSince the inner parts of a valve must be contained into the body of the valve, which\nalso contains the fluid under pressure, then it is necessary to provide some means\nof closure or cover. In addition, an operating mechanism for flow control must be\ncontained into the valve body. Therefore, at least two seals are necessary to a valve.\nThese seals are illustrated in the preceding figure, with reference to a globe valve.\nHowever, they are also necessary with valves of other types.\n\nCover sealing can be obtained in several ways, each of which has its maximum\nlevel of pressure and its cost.\n\nA flat gasket for cover sealing, shown on the left-hand side of the following\nfigure, is not suited to either high-pressure or high-temperature applications, because\nit requires large surfaces. Other types of gaskets which are better suited to these\napplications are the spiral-wound gaskets and the lens ring gasket.

In addition to using materials of low thermal conductivity,\nother methods are also used for the same purpose. These methods are:\n\ne breaking completely the path of heat conduction, by separating the parts which\noperate at different temperatures by an insulating space (for example, in a broken\nstem valve, the valve actuator is thermally insulated from the valve body by means\nof radial bars on the upper stem which drive against axial pins on the lower stem)\nand enclosing the entire valve in an evacuated chamber;\n\n\u00a9 using vacuum-jacketed valves;\n\ne increasing the path of heat conduction, by using extended stems and bonnets\nincluding long gaseous columns, in order to keep the stem seal packings exposed\nonly to insulating vapour, and not to the cold liquid;\n\n\u00a2 providing bonnets with integral black-coated fins, to direct heat away through\nradiation from the packing to the external environment;\n\ne using plastiform insulating foams, made of polystyrene, polyurethane, rubber,\nsilica, and glass, around the valve body; and\n\n\u00a2 using low-density materials, such as powders and fibres, with gas at atmospheric\npressure in the interstitial spaces.\n\nThe following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26], shows a vacuum-jacketed\nvalve used for cryogenic fluids, where the inner wall surrounds the primary pressure\nvessel, and the outer wall is of light construction to reduce to cool-down mass.\n\nY\nCe.\nEo < FY\nae eee\nBrightly finished interior surfaces may be used to reduce radiative heat transfer.\n",

Therefore, these valves are often of the open-\nclosed, two-position, normally closed type. However, some valves are also required to\ncontrol the flow rate of propellants by means of a restriction of variable area. Valves\nof the latter type are used for thrust-throttle and propellant-mixture-ratio control,\nbecause they can continuously vary their operating position, in contrast to shut-off\nvalves, which are either fully open or fully closed.\n\nRequirements for propellant valves are compatibility with propellants, structural\nstrength, absence of leakage in closed position, proper actuation time when opening\nor closing, and minimum pressure loss.\n\nApart from the general classification considered in Sect. 5.8, we describe here in\nparticular the most used types of propellant valves, which are butterfly valves, ball\nvalves, poppet valves, Venturi valves, gate valves, and needle valves.\n\nAn isometric cross section of a butterfly valve is shown in the following figure,\ndue to the courtesy of NASA [29].\n\nLink Threaded lip seal retainer\niP Flow\na\nee Soa ws Housing\nyy, eo 6 to\nSOR -/@\n-. / Rae > | \u00ae LS\nVIL Ri ) & SA Se\nBearing \\\\ 5 Ly\n| S ;\n| ~ Sb YO\nDisk i N SO) \u201cm\n1 x * -\nSY > 5\nDrive shatt CS ,;\nBearing prtg\nShaft\n\nA butterfly valve is used to start, regulate, or stop the motion of a fluid in a duct.\nWith reference to the preceding figure, the movable part of a butterfly valve is a\nflat element, called the disc, which may be rotated to control the flow through the\nvalve body. The disc can rotate on a single-piece shaft or on a two-piece shaft, which\n",

The\ninternal diameter of existing butterfly valves ranges from 50 to 400 mm. These valves\nare used for propellants at absolute pressures ranging from 1.4 x 10\u00b0 to 1 x 107 N/m?\n[3]\n\nFor greater rigidity, the shaft may be integral with the disc. The centre of rotation\nof the disc is usually offset, as shown in the preceding figure, in order to allow the\ndisc to rotate off the primary seal. For low leakage, a plastic lip seal (described in\nChap. 4, Sect. 4.13) is usually employed in the valve housing.\n\nThe discs of butterfly valves have spherical or conical shapes, as shown in the\nfollowing figure, re-drawn from [29]. A disc of spherical shape (left) has better\nperformance, but is more expensive to fabricate.

The actuating power is the pressure exerted by either a non-\ncryogenic liquid propellant or an inert gas, and is controlled by a pilot valve. The\nshaft and the pins are made of stainless steel, whereas most of the other parts are\nmade of aluminium alloys.

The values of the resistance coefficient k as a function of the opening\nangle are given by the manufacturer of the valve or can be found, for example, in\n[30, 31].\n",

When hard seals are used, great care must be\ntaken to eliminate contamination from the fluid and from the duct upstream of the\nvalves.\n\nA poppet valve can be pressure-balanced by using two poppets which are on the\nsame stem and seat on separate seats. By so doing, the pressure acting on the top\nof one poppet provides the counterbalancing force acting on the bottom of the other\npoppet. The same result can also be obtained by providing the poppet stem with a\npressure-balancing piston area, or by making the poppet stem diameter equal to the\nseating diameter. However, it is practically impossible to obtain complete pressure\nbalance under both shut-off and flow conditions.\n\nA poppet valve is lighter than valves of other types for many applications, due\nto the small stroke of its actuator. For example, ball and butterfly valves require a\nrotation through a right angle for full stroke, and therefore need a larger associated\nmechanism. A poppet valve is used when the valve is desired to open rapidly from\nzero to full flow with a short travel of its movable element. Of all types of poppet\nvalve, the in-line valve is the one which has the best flow properties. The body of\na poppet valve may be either cast on one piece or split. In the latter case, the body\nhalves are joined by bolts [25].\n\nA cross section of a cavitating Venturi valve is shown in the following figure,\nre-drawn from [25].\n",
    "508": "5.9 Design of Propellant Valves 501\n\nA cavitating Venturi valve is used to control the flow rate of a propellant in a\nrocket engine as a function of the pressure upstream of the valve and of the throat\narea. When the minimum pressure of a liquid propellant is made to decrease below\nits vapour pressure at the throat of a Venturi tube, then cavitation occurs and the\npropellant evaporates. In case of cavitation, the propellant flow rate is independent\nof the downstream pressure. Cavitation occurs by decreasing the pressure of a liquid\npropellant at the throat of a Venturi tube to such an extent that nearly all of the\nupstream pressure head of the fluid is converted into velocity head. When this occurs,\nthe only static pressure remaining in the fluid at the throat is equal to the vapour\npressure of the fluid itself. In such conditions, when the upstream pressure of the\nfluid is kept constant, a further decrease in downstream pressure does not result in\nincreased flow rate, because cavitation at the throat maintains the pressure equal to\nthe vapour pressure of the fluid.\n\nIn other words, the flow rate through the valve remains constant for a given throat\narea and for a given upstream pressure, independently of the downstream pressure,\nprovided that the downstream pressure does not increase above the level in which\ncavitation occurs. In practice, the downstream pressure must be less than 85% of the\nupstream pressure in order for cavitation to occur [25].\n\nCavitating Venturi valves are used in rocket engines when it is desired to prevent\nvariations of propellant flow rate caused by variable back pressure on the control\nvalve. In the design of a cavitating Venturi valve used to control flow rates, it is\nnecessary to know the total pressure pr (N/m?) and the vapour pressure p, (N/m?)\nof the propellant whose flow rate is to be controlled.

Their use as propellant valves is discussed below. Gate valves\nhave a flat plate which moves perpendicularly to the fluid stream in a duct in order\nto open or close the passage of the fluid through them. They may be operated by\nany of the usual actuators used for this purpose. Quick-return mechanisms have been\nused when it was desired to open or close such valves at different flow rates. When\nthe plate is completely removed from the fluid stream, a gate valve opposes little or\nno resistance to the flow. Consequently, the principal advantage of a gate valve is\nunrestricted fluid stream, and therefore low pressure drop when the valve is in the\nwide open position. When a gate valve is in the closed position, the contact surface\nbetween the plate and the seal extends along the whole circumference of the tube\ncross section, and therefore this valve provides good sealing, which results in little\nor no leakage across the plate.\n",

They are used for temperatures ranging from cryogenic values to 811 K\nand above, and for pressures ranging from vacuum to 2 x 108 N/m? and above [25].\n5.10 Design of Pilot Valves\nPilot valves are used to control fluids, which in turn control other components of\nhydraulic circuits (for example, valves for propellants) or a sequence of events occur-\nring in a rocket engine (for example, the admission of fuel for ignition purposes).\nThe control action performed by a pilot valve is of the on-off, open-loop type. The\nmost common types of pilot valves are solenoid valves, pressure-actuated valves,\nand position-actuated valves in two-way, three-way, and four-way configurations.\n\nA solenoid valve is an electromagnetic device having a solenoid, which is a\nhelically wound coil of wire, a movable cylindrical core of ferromagnetic material\nmounted coaxially within the coil, a poppet, and a return spring. This core is called\nthe plunger. When the coil conducts no electric current, the compressed spring closes\na small orifice by means of the poppet. When a voltage is applied to the ends of the\ncoil, the electric current flowing through the coil generates a magnetic field, which\nexerts a force on the plunger. This force pulls the plunger toward the centre of the\ncoil, thereby opening the orifice. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA\n[32], shows a cross section of a solenoid valve having a spherical poppet.\n\nSolenoid Armature Armature He\nreturn spring {\nCreer Za N \\\nBall . \\ \\\\ .\nreturn spring N sutiet Housing\n",

Solenoid on-off valves are either normally open or\nnormally closed, where the normal position of a valve is the position of its movable\nelement with respect to the upstream pressure when no electric power is applied to\nthe solenoid. In the presence of an electric power, the solenoid places the valve to\nthe desired position by attracting a magnetic core attached to the valve stem. When\nthe electric power is removed, a spring pushes back the magnetic core to its normal\nposition.\nDirectly acting solenoid valves have response times ranging from 5 to 50 ms [25].\nA large opening can be obtained through a short stroke of the movable element.\nThe electric current required to operate these valves depends on their size, on the\ndifference of pressure, and on the response required. Their leakage control is very\ngood, particularly when a soft seat is used. When a hard seat is used, it is advisable\nto lap the seat parts. Solenoid valves do not require external dynamic seals, and have\na very long operating life, of the order of magnitude of hundreds of thousands of\ncycles without degradation of performance [25].\nAccording to Huzel and Huang [3], the following equations apply to the case of\na flat-faced, plunger-type magnetic core\nB\u2019A\nF= \u2014\nCc\nR= fPNi\nG\nwhere F (N) is the attracting force which acts on the plunger in its normal position,\nB (Wb/m\u201d) is the magnetic flux density in the air gap, A (m2) is the cross-sectional\narea of the plunger, C is a factor comprising constants and allowances for stray flux\n(a value of 2.505 x 10~\u00b0 is applicable to round, flat-faced, plunger-type magnets), f\nis a leakage factor of the magnetic flux, whose value is less than unity and depends\non the magnetic circuit, P is a factor comprising constants and the permeability of\nthe fluid in the gap G (m) between the core and the armature (a value P = 1.255 x\n",

There are two principal types of servo-valves. In a servo-valve of the nozzle-\nflapper type, the pressure exerted by the fluid on the actuator is controlled directly by\na flapper, which restricts the flow through two nozzles of variable size, in response to\nan electrical input signal applied to a torque motor. In a servo-valve of the spool type,\nthe pressure is controlled indirectly, by means of a sliding spool, whose position in\nthe body of the valve depends on the angular position of the flapper. A spool is a solid\ncylindrical element having two or more recesses which fits closely in the bore of the\nvalve body, such that the valve opens or closes by translating the spool within the bore.\nIn other words, a servo-valve of the spool type is an electro-hydraulic valve having a\nspool, whose position in the valve body changes proportionally to an electrical input\nsignal received by the valve. The translational motion of the spool in the valve is\nobtained by hydraulic pressure, and changes the size of two orifices in order for the\nvalve to control flow. The control exerted by the valve depends on the difference of\nhydraulic pressure across the orifices, unless some form of compensation is used. A\nfunctional scheme of a servo-valve of the spool type is given in the following figure,\nre-drawn from [42].\n",

The flapper is located between two opposed\nnozzles, and therefore its motion in one or in the other direction restricts the flow\nthrough one or the other of these nozzles. When no electrical signal is applied to the\ntorque motor, then the flapper is located at an equal distance between the two nozzles\n(neutral position). The presence of an electrical signal causes the flapper to move\ntoward one or the other nozzle, thereby producing an unbalance of hydraulic pressure\nacross the spool. The set of components comprising the torque motor, the nozzles,\nand the flapper is known as the first stage of a servo-valve. The first stage pilots the\nsecond stage, which comprises the spool and the feedback spring. The spring makes\nthe displacement of the spool proportional to the difference of pressure caused by\nthe off-centre position of the flapper in the first stage. The position of the flapper,\nin turn, depends on the force generated by the torque motor in response to the input\nsignal.\n",
    "529": "522 5 Control Systems and Valves\n\nTherefore, the direction and the magnitude of the displacement of the spool are\nproportional to the direction and to the magnitude of the input signal, and are used to\ncontrol the direction and the magnitude of flow to the actuator through the pressure\nat the cylinder ports of the valve. For example, with reference to the preceding figure,\nan electrical signal resulting in a displacement of the flapper to the right restricts the\nflow from the nozzle on the right hand side. This restriction increases the pressure\nupstream of the right nozzle circuit, and decreases the pressure upstream of the left\ncircuit. This unbalance of pressure causes the spool to shift to the left, until the\ndifference of pressure is balanced by the pressure exerted by the spring on the spool.\nThe shift of the spool to the left opens a flow path from the pressure port placed on the\nleft to the cylinder port A, and the returning fluid through the cylinder port B moves\nthrough the return line to the reservoir. A servo-valve is not only an electrical-to-\nhydraulic transducer, but also a power amplifier, because the electrical input power,\nwhose order of magnitude is about 0.1 W, is amplified in the first stage to at least\n10 W of hydraulic power, and then used to control, by means of the spool, an amount\nof about 10 kW of hydraulic power. Therefore, the power amplification factor in a\ntwo-stage servo-valve is 10\u00b0 [42].\n\nAnother two-stage servo-valve of the spool type is illustrated in the following\nfigure, re-drawn from [25]. In the servo-valve shown below, the spool is spring-\nloaded, in order for its position in the valve to be proportional to the input received\nfrom the first stage. The spool is centred by helical coil springs on each side. Inte-\ngral filters are used to remove small particles, which would otherwise coalesce and\nobstruct orifices and nozzles. These filters are also used to protect the spool from\ncontaminants. This servo-valve has also a drain bleed system to protect the torque\nmotor from leakage fluid.\n",

These servo-valves convert\nthe electrical command signal from the engine controller (described in Sect. 5.2)\nto hydraulic flow directed to the valve actuator. They convert the polarity and the\namplitude of the electrical command signal into respectively the rotation direction\nand the rotation rate of the shaft. The two servo-valves are redundant, in order for the\nfailure of one of them not to affect the performance of the actuators. An assembly\nof one of these servo-valves is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of\nBoeing-Rocketdyne [7]. When the torque motor of the servo-valve tilts in response to\nthe polarity and to the amplitude of the input signal, the flow restriction is increased\nat one nozzle, and decreased at the other. These variable restrictors are paired with\nconstant restrictors at the end of the filter, forming two matched pressure dividers.\nTherefore, the pressures applied to the ends of the spool in the second stage can be\nvaried, being equal in the null position and not equal otherwise.\n",

The spool offset in effect simultaneously moves one port toward the input\n(higher) pressure, and the other port toward the return (lower) pressure, driving the\npistons. Therefore, the polarity of the signal determines the direction of rotation, and\nthe amplitude of the signal determines the rotation rate in the valve [7].\n\nThe equations which can be used for the design of servo-valves of the flapper-\nnozzle type are those shown in Sect. 5.11 for the flow of liquid or gaseous substances\nthrough nozzles or orifices.

The pressure is controlled by varying the flow in the valve\n\nas a function of the sensed difference between the actual value and the desired value\nof pressure. Any unbalanced force resulting from this difference of pressure moves\n\na metering element, which increases or decreases flow to reduce the pressure error\n\nto zero [25].\n\nHowever, in the aerospace field, the name of pressure regulator indicates any\ndevice which maintains a desired value of upstream, downstream, or differential\npressure by means of a pressure-reducing control element. For example, pressure\nregulators are used to maintain a constant pneumatic pressure in a tank for the storage\nof liquid propellants. In a pump-fed rocket engine, this constant pressure is used to\nprotect the structure of the tank and to meet the requirements of pump suction head.\nA further protection is provided to the tank by a relief valve.\n\nIn control systems of large rocket engines, pressure regulators maintain the pres-\nsure of gas at a constant value to operate engine control valves, main propellant\nvalves, gas-generator valves, and other control components [43].\n\nIn pneumatic control systems, variations of regulated pressure affect valve timing\nand sequencing in engine start and shutdown operations. In reaction-control systems,\nthe source of energy for propellant feed is supplied by gas stored at high pressure\n[43].\n\nPressure regulators can be classified into the following categories:\n\ne pressure-reducing regulators, which are used to reduce the pressure upstream of\nthem to a desired downstream pressure, independently of variations of upstream\npressure;\n\n\u00a2 back pressure regulators, which measure and regulate the pressure upstream of\nthem independently of variations of downstream pressure; and\n\ne differential pressure regulators, which maintain a constant difference of pressure\nacross a restrictor of constant area, for example, across an orifice, to maintain a\nconstant desired value of flow rate.\n\nThe pressure regulators described in the present section are only those of the\nfirst type. The regulators of the other types (relief valves and differential pressure\nregulators) will be described in the following sections.\n\nPressure-reducing regulators may be modulating or non-modulating. A regulator\nof the modulating type is a device which maintains a constant regulated pressure in\na tank. A regulator of the non-modulating type is an on-off device which maintains\nthe pressure in a tank between chosen limits by means of a signal from a pressure\nswitch, which senses variations of pressure in the tank, and consequently opens or\n",

The reference load due to the spring acts\non the sensing element in one direction, and the force due to the regulated pressure\nacts in the opposite direction. The combination comprising the sensing element, the\ninlet valve, and the stem, which connects the sensing element with the inlet valve, is\ncalled the metering element. The force exerted by the reference spring on the sensing\nelement is called the load. The sensing element is also subject to the actual regulated\npressure and compresses the reference spring, which is used to establish the desired\npressure setting. The net force acting on the inlet valve controls the flow through the\nregulator.\n\nThe movable element of the inlet valve may, or may not, be pressure-balanced.\nWhen the movable element is not pressure-balanced, then the inlet pressure acts on\nthe main seat and changes the force equilibrium within the inlet valve. Consequently,\na loss of inlet pressure across the main seat results in an increase in outlet pressure.\nWhen the movable element is pressure-balanced, then there is no variation of outlet\npressure resulting from changes of inlet pressure. A regulator having a pressure-\nbalanced movable element requires a dynamic seal to pressure-balance the main seat\nof the inlet valve.\n\nThe set point of a direct-acting regulator can be adjusted by means of a screw\n(not shown in the figure) which lifts or lowers a plate located above the reference\n",

To a low value of the constant\nof the reference spring there corresponds a high value of the stroke of the movable\nelement of the inlet valve which it is possible to achieve.\n\nWhen a highly accurate regulation with small changes of outlet pressure is desired,\nthen a large area of the sensing element is needed to achieve a high driving force.\nTherefore, a high force due to the reference spring is needed. Since a low value of the\nspring constant is desired, then it is necessary to use springs having a high number\nof coils. This, in turn, increases the size and the mass of the regulator.\n\nThe principal disadvantage of a spring-loaded regulator is that any change in the\nspring length during the regulation cycle changes the load and the set point of the\nregulator. This undesirable effect can be counteracted by using a spring having low\nvalue of spring constant, or by decreasing the stroke of the movable element [25].\n\nA dome-loaded regulator is a regulator in which the source of reference load\nis a force obtained by pressurising the dome above the sensing element with gas.\nA scheme of a dome-loaded regulator is shown in the following figure, due to the\ncourtesy of NASA [43].\n\nDiaphragm -7 a Actuator r- Orifice\n/ !\nFlow from S SS S\nloader valve \u201cWHS KG L SSIS INN Towers\nVfl Rl y\nWY WG one\u201d\nBias spring .

It is the\nreference pressure which a pilot gas exerts on the dome above the sensing element.\nThe pilot gas, which may be the same as the gas whose pressure is to be regulated,\nis supplied to the dome through a small loader valve. The loader valve reduces the\nsupply pressure to the desired reference pressure. The excess of pilot gas is directed\nto a vent side through an orifice. The poppet of the inlet valve is opened or closed by\nthe pressure of the pilot gas and by the stroke of the diaphragm, which depends on\nthe chosen pressure.\n\nA pilot-operated regulator is a small flow control device operated by a small\nactuation force which controls indirectly a large flow requiring a large actuation\nforce.

The pressure switch senses the pressure in a tank, and the on-off\nvalve controls the flow of a pressurising gas to the tank. A pressure transducer with\nan amplifying circuit may be used instead of the pressure switch. When the pressure\nin the tank decreases below the minimum desired value, the electrical contacts of\nthe pressure switch close, and an electrical signal opens the solenoid valve. This\ncauses the pressurising gas to flow to the tank to increase the pressure in the tank.\nAs the pressure in the tank approaches the desired maximum value, the contacts\nof the pressure switch open, the solenoid valve is not fed by current, and the flow\nof the pressurising gas stops. Therefore, the pressure in the tank oscillates between\na minimum value and a maximum value. Since this regulator requires an external\nsource of energy, then a failure of this source of energy or of any of its components\ncan cause a failure of a system of pressurisation using the regulator [43].\n\nAnother example of non-modulating regulator is the device developed by the\nFrebank Company. This regulator is a single stage, pilot operated valve meant to\ncontrol the pressure in the tank of a missile.

In the regulator shown in the preceding figure,\nthe two set points are determined by the pre-deflection point and the post-deflection\npoint, which limit the travel of the Belleville springs. The pre-deflection point is\ndetermined by the adjustment ring, and the post-deflection point is determined by\nthe stop. The regulated pressure exerts a force on the sensing diaphragm through\nthe sensing port. The force acting on the diaphragm is transmitted by the diaphragm\nassembly to the Belleville springs. In the absence of pressure, no force acts on the\ndiaphragm. In this condition, the actuator assembly (comprising the diaphragm and\nthe Belleville springs) holds the head of the pin against the pre-deflection travel\nstop, and causes the pilot valve to be fully open. The adjustment ring provides the\npre-deflection adjustment. Gas at high pressure, introduced into the inlet port, flows\nthrough an orifice, through the open pilot valve, and into the sense chamber through\nthe flow passage. When the pilot valve is open, the pressure difference across the\norifice causes the pressure in the chamber behind the poppet of the main valve to\ndecrease, thereby creating a pressure difference across the poppet. This pressure\ndifference creates a force unbalance, and the poppet opens until it bottoms on the\nshank of the seat of the pilot valve. Now, the gas flows directly through the main valve\ninto the ullage space. When the pressure in the tank reaches the value corresponding\n",
    "544": "5.13 Design of Pressure-Reducing Regulators 537\nto the pre-deflection setting of the Belleville springs, the actuator assembly snaps to\nthe post-deflection stop. Now, the pilot valve, which is no longer held open by the\nactuator assembly, is closed by the spring between the poppets. When the pilot valve\nis closed, the pressure increases in the chamber between the poppets, and reaches\na value where the poppet of the main valve closes. The pressure in the chamber\ncontinues to increase, until it becomes equal to the inlet pressure, and then both\npoppets are held on their seats by the pressure difference between the inlet and the\noutlet, and also by the spring force of the poppet. When the actuator assembly is\nat the post-deflection stop and both poppets are closed, the regulator is in lock-up.\nIn this condition, any demand on the system decreases the pressure in the ullage\nspace. As the pressure drops to a value of the post-deflection setting, the actuator\nassembly snaps to the pre-deflection point. The pin moves the poppet of the pilot\nvalve to the full open position, and the chamber between the poppets evacuates to\ncreate the pressure difference to cause the poppet of the main valve to open. This\ncycle is repeated to hold the regulated pressure in the dead-band [25].\n\nFor the pressure regulators described above, the characteristic flow area A, (m7) of\nthe regulator, that is, the area of the valve in fully open position, can be determined as\na function of the required mass flow rate m (kg/s) and of the regulated outlet pressure\npy (N/m?) at the minimum allowable inlet pressure p; (N/m?) of the pressurising gas,\nby using the equations of Sect. 5.11, which govern the flow of gases through orifices.\nThese equations are\n\n2 wiqy3\ny-l[\\p Pi\nwhich holds under non-chocked flow conditions, and\nn= cra. ymn(; \"7 :)\nwhich holds under choked (that is, maximum) flow conditions. In the preceding\nequations, Cy is the coefficient of discharge, and p; (kg/m?) is the density of the gas\nupstream of the regulator. The design values of Cy range from 0.6 to 0.7 [3].\n\nAs an example of application, the following data are known for the gas (helium)\npressure regulator used in a rocket engine: design mass flow rate ri = 0.02177 kg/s,\nminimum allowable inlet pressure pj = 1.689 x 10\u00b0 N/m7, inlet temperature T =\n572 K at the minimum inlet pressure, required regulated outlet pressure p, = 1.158 x\n10\u00b0 N/m?, and flow discharge coefficient Cq = 0.65 of the regulator.\n\nIt is required to calculate the characteristic area A, of the pressure regulator.\n\nFrom [40] we take the following data for helium in the inlet conditions: specific\nheat ratio y = 1.666, and density p; = 1.416 kg/m?.\n\nAs has been shown in Sect. 5.11, the critical pressure ratio of helium is\n",

The\nflow-meter has static pressure taps placed at two points along the fluid stream, as has\nbeen shown in Sect. 5.7, for the Venturi tube. In Sect. 5.7, it has also been shown\nhow the volume flow rate depends on the pressure drop. When the pressure drop\nacross a flow-meter is kept constant, then the volume flow rate will also be constant.\nThe pressure drop is kept constant by using a pressure-reducing regulator. The static\npressures are impressed to the fluid on opposite sides of the sensing element of the\nregulator. These pressures can be adjusted by means of a spring placed on one side\nof the sensing element. The force provided by the spring can be regulated so as\nto balance the lower value of static pressure against the upper value. The working\nprinciple of a direct-acting differential pressure regulator, designed by the W.A. Kates\nCompany, is illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [44].\n",

    "548": "5.15 Design of Relief Valves 541\nused. For example, there are relief valves for liquid oxygen, and relief valves for\ngaseous helium. The fluid in excess is discharged overboard.\n\nAn excess of pressure can occur in a tank due to thermal changes or to leaking\nvalves. Relief valves differ from other valves, because their operation creates a high\npressure drop during flow [43].\n\nA relief valve consists of a valve body, a source of reference load (such as a\nspring), and a control element (such as a poppet) which matches with a seat. The\nfollowing figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43], shows a modulating (left) and a\nnon-modulating (right) directly-operated relief valve.\n\n\u00ab\u2014 Reference spring Belleville yr Open-position stop\ni reference \\\nyi \u2018 sening \\ \\ Ae Eressure:solance\nPoppet. \u00a2p % \\ \\ *\nFull flow stroke RoR oun Yr UY, Li\nTZ inet Yi BES\n{ a Poppet Y ZG\n\\# pa ee diameter t Z\nIn\n\nIn a direct-operating relief valve, the reference load due to the spring is applied\nat all times to the control element. The reference load acts on the control element\nagainst the pressure in the tank or in the circuit under control. The intensity of the\nload determines the set point of the relief pressure. When the pressure of the fluid in\nthe tank rises to the level necessary to balance the reference load, then the control\nelement moves from the seat so as to discharge the fluid in excess to a reservoir of\nlower pressure placed downstream of the valve. Likewise, when the pressure of the\nfluid in the tank decreases below the set point, then the reference load acting against\nthe pressure closes the valve.\n\nA relief valve has good operating characteristics when the pressure py for rated\nflow and the pressure p, for reseat closely approach the cracking pressure p,. The\ncracking pressure is the relief setting of the valve, that is, the pressure level at which\nthe leakage flow reaches some specified value. The cracking pressure is always less\nthan the allowable working pressure of the tank, and is usually less than 110% of the\nnormal operating pressure. The rated flow is usually established for pressures 10%\ngreater than the pressure setting of the relief valve. The reseat pressure is less than\nthe cracking pressure, by an amount depending on the configuration of the closure\n(control element and seat). A reseat pressure of 95% of the cracking pressure is a\ncommon value [25].\n\nA relief valve may be not only directly-operated, as shown in the preceding figure,\nbut also inversely-operated or pilot-operated. The following figure, due to the cour-\ntesy of NASA [43], shows an inversely-operated (left) and a pilot-operated (right)\nrelief valve.\n",

The diaphragm senses the increasing\npressure in the tank and, at some value of pressure, strokes the hanger which comes\nin contact with the poppet and reduces the closing force applied to the poppet. When\nthe forces applied to the poppet are equal, then the valve is at the cracking pressure.\nThe bias spring applies a load to the poppet to place it in the initial position at low-\npressure sealing [43]. It is desirable that the force which holds the poppet on the seat\nat a specified pressure p, (where p, is less than the cracking pressure p,) should be as\ngreat as possible. For this purpose, the effective area Aq of the diaphragm is larger\nthan the unbalanced seat area A,, as follows\n\nAg= Pa,\nPc \u2014 Pt\n\nThe effective diameter of the diaphragm becomes increasingly larger than the\ndiameter of the seat when the maximum closing pressure approaches the cracking\npressure.\n\nA pilot-operated relief valve is used when it is necessary to control large flows.\nWhen this valve is in the non-relieving conditions, the control pressure of the actuator\nis at the level of the inlet pressure, and the resulting force holds the main poppet in\nthe position of closure. When the inlet pressure increases so as to reach the cracking\nvalue, the pilot valve partially strokes, the control pressure of the actuator is ported\nto the outlet cavity, the pressure in the actuator control-pressure is reduced so much\nthat the resulting force is zero, and the main poppet is ready to open. As the inlet\npressure continues to increase, the pilot valve stroke increases, the pressure in the\ncontrol-pressure cavity decreases, and the resulting force opens the main poppet [43].\n\nIn airborne applications, lightweight materials, such as aluminium, are used for\nthe valve body. The source of reference load is a force acting against an increase in\npressure on the control element until the set point of pressure relief is reached. The\nmost common element used for this purpose is a compressed spring.\n",

The control element may be a ball, or a poppet (which\nin turn may be conical or V-shaped), or a piston.\n\nAnother type of pilot-operated relief valve, used to protect propellant tanks from\noverpressure, has been described by Huzel and Huang [3]. A scheme of this valve\nis illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [3]. Both the main valve and\nthe pilot valve are normally held closed by the spring forces F's, and F,3 and by the\ncontrol pressure p,. The controller of the pilot valve senses the pressure p, in the tank.\nWhen the pressure in the tank reaches or exceeds the preset level, the pilot valve is\nactuated to crack. This vents the actuator control pressure p, of the main relief valve\nand in turn permits the main valve to open. The position of the poppet of the main\nvalve depends on the control pressure p,, which in turn is controlled by the position\nof the poppet of the pilot valve and by the pressure p, in the tank.\n\nWith reference to the following figure, it is required to determine the dimensions,\nin terms of diameters, for the main valve and for the pilot valve.

A check valve allows a fluid to move freely in one direction, and stops the\nmotion in case of a pressure reversal. A pressure reversal may occur in a fluid either\nnormally or as a result of a failure. In the latter case, a flow reversal must be promptly\nstopped, in order to avoid an overflow or an overpressure in a tank, or an unwanted\ncombination of reactive fluids, or other damages to components of a rocket engine.\n\nA check valve operates automatically, because its movable element is actuated by\nthe forces exerted by the moving fluid. In case of aerospace vehicles, the movable\nelement of a check valve is spring-loaded, in order for the valve to be operated\nindependently of either the gravitational force or the attitude of the vehicle. A check\nvalve requires neither an actuation signal nor a source of power for its operation.\nHowell and Weathers [25] have identified some criteria to be considered in the design\nand in the choice of a particular type of check valve. These criteria are briefly indicated\nbelow.\n\nThe first of them concerns the pressure drop across a check valve. In valves used\nfor aerospace applications, it is desirable to keep the increase in pressure drop with\nincreasing volume flow rate as low as possible. The increase in pressure drop in a\nvalve depends on the type (sphere or cone frustum or poppet having another shape)\nof its closing element.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the type of seal used in a check valve. This is because\nthe sealing properties of a check valve depend on the sealing material, on the initial\n",
    "556": "5.16 Design of Check Valves 549\nload of the spring, and on the difference of pressure across the closing element of\nthe valve. In case of a pressure reversal, a check valve leaks until the back pressure\nacting on it becomes as high as to provide a sufficient seating force. In order for the\nvalve not to leak when the reversal pressure is null or very low, the initial load of\nthe spring must be high, which fact implies a high value of pressure drop when the\ncontrolled fluid moves in its normal direction. The use of elastic materials for the\nseat makes it possible to reduce leakage at low values of the seating load.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the cracking and the reseating pressures of a check\nvalve. As has been shown in Sect. 5.15, the cracking pressure of a valve is the\nminimum pressure which assures a given value of flow rate. The reseating pressure\nof a valve is the reverse differential pressure needed to keep leakage at or below a\ngiven value. A proper choice of the spring loading and of the seating properties can\nreduce the reseating pressure. The cracking and the reseating pressures of a check\nvalve depend on its pressure drop and on its leakage properties.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the type of fluid moving through a check valve. The\nmaterials (including metals, seals, and coatings) of which a valve is made must be\ncompatible with the fluid controlled by the valve. In particular, the choice of the\nmaterials depends on whether the fluid is a liquid or a gas. In the latter case, special\ncare must be taken with gases of low molar mass, such as hydrogen and helium.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the operating pressure of a check valve. The body of\na valve must be designed for the maximum pressure to which the valve is subject.\nIn particular, when a valve is rapidly closed, a water hammer can arise in the valve.\nThis phenomenon increases the level of pressure several times the normal operating\npressure. When a valve is subject to a large number of pressure cycles, a failure due\nto fatigue must be taken into account.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the temperature at which the fluid and the valve\noperate. Special care must be taken of the non-metallic materials which are used\nfor the seals. All materials used in a valve must be designed to withstand the worst\nthermal conditions in their operating environment. Since the mass of the valve acts\nas a heat sink, short-term excursions of temperature beyond the recommended limits\nare tolerable. Particular attention should be given to temperature gradients, which\ncan give rise to binding effects due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion\nof the materials.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the sensitivity of either the fluid system or the fluid\nitself to contamination. Contamination can cause malfunction or internal leakage in\na valve. Special care must be taken of the valve body and of the seals.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the operations of maintenance required by a valve.\nThe maintenance requirements should be reduced as far as possible, and the need to\nuse special tools should be avoided. Seals requiring periodic replacement should be\nreadily available and easily accessible. Care must be taken to avoid contamination\nduring disassembly and service.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the mass and the size of a valve, which are aspects\nof primary importance in valves used for aerospace applications. For example, in a\ncheck valve of the ball type, the mass of the ball is proportional the cube of its radius;\nby contrast, in a check valve of the flapper type, the mass of the closing element is\n",
    "557": "550 5 Control Systems and Valves\nnearly proportional to the square of its linear size. Therefore, check valves of the\nball type are rarely used when the radius of the ball exceeds | cm. In this case,\nflapper-type or swing-type check valves are used.\n\nAnother aspect concerns the cost of a check valve. The cost depends on such\nfactors as operating pressure, temperature, flow rate, leakage requirements, type\nof fluid, mass, reliability, and life-cycle requirements. In case of check valves\nused for aerospace applications, performance and reliability are factors of primary\nimportance.\n\nAnother criterion concerns the operating life of a check valve. The operating\nlife depends on such factors as type of fluid, contamination, operating temperature,\nstresses, number of cycles, type of seals, materials of construction, and procedures\nof maintenance. In order to increase the operating life of a valve, loads and stresses\nacting on the valve components should be reduced as far as possible. However, valves\nto be used for aerospace applications should not be over-designed for their life-cycle\nrequirements.\n\nAccording to Tomlinson and Keller [43], check valves can be classified in two\ncategories: poppet valves and flapper valves. Three different valves (ball, cone, and\nfloating ring) of the poppet type are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy\nof NASA [43].\n\n; SSNs |\nYe YUE AAA? fe)\n( N\n( <= Flow \\N <= Flow\n@ \u00e9 SP\nBe Ya 4 BER UZ\nZZ ZZ,\nBall Cone\n\\_\nVs\nFloating ring\n\nA check valve of the poppet type has a poppet as its closing element. This poppet\ntranslates axially in the valve body and a compressed spring of the coil type forces\nthe poppet against the seat. Valves of this type are used in applications requiring low\nleakage in the direction of the checked flow and low pressure drop in the direction\nof the free flow. The cracking pressure is low (in the range going from 21000 to\n103000 N/m2, according to [43], and the full-flow pressure is as close to the cracking\n",
    "558": "5.16 Design of Check Valves 551\npressure as possible. The cracking pressure of check valves of the poppet type can\nbe increased by increasing the load of the return spring. In these conditions, a check\nvalve can be used as a relief valve or a back-pressure regulator [43]. A check valve\nof the ball type is illustrated in the preceding figure. This valve has a hard ball as\nits closing element. The ball is spring-loaded against a circular, conical, or spherical\nseat. In order to reduce leakage, a soft seal is sometimes used. This soft seat is made\nof Teflon\u00ae, or of another plastic or elastomeric material. Otherwise, a combination\nof soft with hard materials is used for the seat. The force due to the fluid stream\nlifts the ball off the seat against the load provided by the spring, and the flow passes\naround the ball. Since the flow must surround the ball, then a check valve of the ball\ntype has a tendency toward turbulence and a higher pressure drop than other types\nof check valves. In normal operating conditions, the ball may rotate slightly on the\nreturn spring, thereby causing wear on the ball and on the seat. A check valve of\nthe ball type is prone to chatter when opened by a low flow which does not fully\nstroke and hold the ball in the full-open position. By chatter we mean an uncontrolled\nseating and reseating of the closing element of a valve. Check valves of the ball type\nare simple and cheap to manufacture, since the seat is the only costly detail. They are\nused in low-flow applications where the stroke is short and the ball will self-guide\ninto the seat [43].\n\nA check valve of the cone type is an improvement of the valve of the ball type\ndescribed above. The improvement is obtained by guiding and aligning the closing\nelement in a constant direction, in order for its contact with the seat to be continuous\nand even. For this purpose, the ball is replaced by a piston sliding in a hollow cylinder\nand having a conical seating surface at one end. This surface is spring-loaded to seat\nagainst a spherical or conical surface, which may be made of either a soft material or\na hard material. A check valve of the cone type has a lower pressure drop than one\nof the ball type having the same size, and a lower tendency to chatter, because of the\nguided movement and the resultant damping of its closing element. The presence of\ncontaminating particles in the seating area and between the piston and the body of\nthe valve can cause sticking or cocking with consequent leakage between the piston\nand the seating area.\n\nA check valve of the floating-ring type is also a valve having a closing element\nguided and aligned in a constant direction. It has a mushroom-shaped poppet, whose\nstem slides in the valve body and whose head seals through an O-ring against a\ncircular flat or tapered seat. The force due to the fluid stream causes the head of the\npoppet to move off the seat in the flow direction, and the fluid passes through the\nstem of the poppet, around the head of the poppet, and through the body of the valve.\nA check valve of this type has a lower pressure drop at an equal flow rate than a ball\nor a cone check valve. Damping chambers may be incorporated in a floating-ring\nvalve in order to eliminate chatter and hammering. The presence of contaminating\nparticles between the poppet stem and the valve body can cause sticking and leakage.\nA check valve of the floating-ring type has more components and therefore is more\ncostly than a ball or a cone check valve.\n",
    "559": "552 5 Control Systems and Valves\nTwo check valves of the flapper type, namely, a split-flapper (left) and a swing-\nflapper (right) valve, are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA\n[43].\nPivot Pivot\nTorsion spring _ Yj y\nUP FY 4\nQe <= Flow / <ee Flow\nNy Z LLL\nYyp Torsion spring\nSplit flapper Swing flapper\n\nA check valve of the flapper type has a rotating flapper as its closing element.\nThe loaded spring acting on the flapper is of the torsion type, and the flapper may\nbe either a split element which pivots across the centre of the flow path or a single\nelement which pivots from the side.\n\nFlapper check valves are used in applications requiring low pressure drop with\nlarge flow rates. They are often smaller and lighter than those of the poppet\ntype. However, when subject to high pressures, flapper check valves may become\nexcessively heavy [43].\n\nA swing-flapper check valve has a hinged disc which seats against a flat or tapered\nsurface, or a circular sharp edge. A fluid stream moving through the valve in the free-\nflow direction swings the hinged disc from the seat and out of the flow path, thereby\npermitting a substantially unrestricted passage with very low pressure drop. When\nthe flow through the valve stops or reverses its direction, the disc swings rapidly to\nits seat, thereby closing the valve against the reverse flow.\n\nVery low pressure drops con be obtained with swing-flapper check valves, because\nsmall opening forces are required, and also because their disc swings out of the flow\npath. The presence of contaminating particles in the fluid has little effect on their\nperformance. On the other hand, they are particularly subject to water hammer in\ncase of sudden reversal of flow. This is because their disc rotates through a large angle\nfrom the open position to the closed position, and consequently the velocity of the\nreverse flow increases significantly before the complete closure of the disc. For this\nreason, their performance in eliminating a reverse flow is poor. Check valves of the\nswing-flapper type are used for applications requiring the minimum value of pressure\ndrop and scarce control of fluid contamination. They are not used for applications\nhaving a high tendency toward sudden flow reversal.\n\nCheck valves of the split-flapper type have two or more hinged elements instead\nof one hinged disc. This makes it possible to reduce the moment of inertia of each\nhinged element. A typical split-flapper valve has two semi-circular elements which\nare open when the fluid stream moves through the valve in the free-flow direction\n",
    "560": "5.16 Design of Check Valves 553\nand closed otherwise. A pressure drop in a split-flapper valve can be reduced to a\nminimum value, as is also the case with a swing-flapper valve. For two valves of\nthe same size, the flapper is lighter in a split-flapper valve than is in a swing-flapper\nvalve. In addition, a split-flapper valve can bear a heavier life cycle and has a better\nperformance in case of water hammer than a valve of the other type. Split-flapper\nvalves are used principally in pneumatic systems. Their principal advantage is the\nminimum pressure drop for a given diameter. They are also scarcely sensitive to\nfluid contamination and have better performance than swing-flapper valves when a\nsudden flow reversal may occur.\n5.17 Design of Burst Discs\nA burst disc, also known as a safety disc or a rupture disc or a frangible disc, is a\nthin metallic diaphragm designed to burst when the pressure in a tank or in a line\nexceeds a pre-set value. For example, a burst disc is used in a flow-carrying line to\ninitiate flow when ruptured by sufficient pressure in the line. A burst disc commonly\nused is one of the pre-bulged type, which is shown in the following figure, due to the\ncourtesy of NASA [43].\nNZ\nSS iz 2 _\u2014Prebulged burst disk\n\\ [--\n\\\nBurst pressure => DB\n\nThe burst disc shown in the preceding figure bursts due to tension induced by\npressure, without the use of local weakening such as coined or machined grooves to\ninitiate and control the bursting.\n\nAnother type of burst disc commonly used is the reverse-action knife-blade burst\ndisc, shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43].\n",

(0) Disk after rupture.\n\nThe burst disc shown above, before rupture (left) and after rupture (right), is\npressure-loaded on a circular cutter by means of a Belleville spring, which is\ncompressed into the negative-spring-rate region of the spring stroke. The Belleville\nspring supports a portion of the pressure acting on the burst disc up to a pre-set burst\npressure. When this value of pressure is exceeded, the spring washer starts to stroke,\nits supporting force decreases rapidly, and the pressure causes the disc to be sheared\nby the sharp circular cutter. A catch screen may be required to keep the cut disc from\nmoving downstream. The burst pressure of the disc can be pre-set by replacing the\ncutter with a flat plug and adjusting the Belleville spring washer until the desired\nburst pressure is indicated by the motion of the burst disc [43].\n\nBurst discs are used for many components of rocket engines, such as hypergolic-\nstart cartridges, repeat-start turbine spinner assemblies, pump-seal drain lines, and\nsome instrumentation. They are also used to seal a cavity against downstream pressure\nor temperature, or to contain a liquid until a rise of pressure to a desired level ruptures\nthe disc.\n\nThe burst pressure is the primary element to be considered in the design of a burst\ndisc. This is because a burst disc must remain intact in all conditions of storage,\n",

The value of the burst pressure usually ranges from 6.895 x 10\u00b0 to 6.895 x\n10\u2019 N/m? [43], depending on the application.\n\nLow values of burst pressure are desired for a cartridge containing an ignition\naid for the thrust chamber of a rocket engine, in order to burst the cartridge discs,\nrelease the ignition aid, and establish ignition as soon as possible. Of course, the\nburst pressure must not be so low as to cause premature rupture in the discs due to\nthe vapour pressure or to the thermal expansion of the propellants, or to handling\nloads. High values of burst pressure are desired for a burst disc used for the ignition\nof a pyrotechnic device, so long as the burning rate of the charge does not become\nexcessive and the pressure level remains below the allowable operating pressure of\nthe container [43].\n\nBurst discs are made of aluminium alloys, mild steel, stainless steel, nickel,\nMonel\u00ae, Inconel\u00ae, copper, silver, gold, and platinum. Aluminium is used because\nof its low physical properties and good forming and machining properties. However,\nsince the properties of this material vary widely with temperature, the upper temper-\nature limit is only about 394 K [43]. Mild steel requires protection from corrosion.\nThis material has low cost and good formability. Stainless steel and Inconel\u00ae are\ndifficult to tool. Inconel\u00ae can be used over a wide range of temperatures. Silver,\ngold, and platinum resist corrosion and have good physical properties.\n\nBurst discs can be attached mechanically or by welding. They must not be corroded\nby the fluid, and the materials of which they are made must not cause decomposition\nin the fluid.\n\nThe thickness of burst discs ranges from 0.05 to 3.18 mm [43], in case of coined-\ngroove discs, for the material remaining under the groove. In this type of disc, the\nmaterial is weakened locally by grooves which are stamped into the metal. The\nfollowing figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43], shows three patterns (radial,\nsingle hinge, and double hinge) used for these grooves.\n\nS\n(a) Radial, (b) Single hinge.

    "563": "556 5 Control Systems and Valves\n5.18 Design of Explosive Valves\n\nExplosive valves, also known as squib valves, are shut-off devices actuated by a very\ncompact source of energy only once in a given mission.\n\nThe source of energy used by them is an explosive charge which generates high\npressure on an actuator. It is possible to actuate repeatedly an explosive valve by\nusing multiple squibs. However, most explosive valves are designed to operate only\nonce, and are either replaced or refurbished after use. Since the explosive charge is\nexpendable, the remaining part of the valve is often designed to be also expendable.\nThis makes it possible to reduce mass and obtain very good sealing.\n\nThese valves cannot be tested non-destructively. Therefore, their reliability for\na specific mission must be evaluated statistically, by purchasing a large number of\nthem for qualification.\n\nExplosive valves are actuated by mechanical energy resulting from conversion of\nchemical energy contained in explosive charges. This chemical energy can be released\nby the charges either by deflagration, which is the rapid combustion of the explosive\nmaterial, or by detonation, which is the propagation of a shock wave through the\nexplosive material. In case of deflagration, the mechanical energy obtained is the\nwork done by the combusted gases acting on a piston. In case of detonation, the\nmechanical energy obtained is due to the momentum of the shock wave propagating\nthrough the explosive charge. This momentum is transferred to a piston, as if the end\nof the piston were subject to a sharp blow.\n\nIn either case, a small amount of explosive material is necessary to actuate a\nvalve. For example, a typical normally-closed valve, 19.05 mm in diameter, whose\nworking pressure is 2.759 x 107 N/m?, uses 140 mg of explosive material. The\nexplosive pressure of this valve is about 1.724 x 107 N/m\u00ae [25].\n\nA deflagrating charge used for explosive valves consists of small flake-like parti-\ncles of powder similar to shotgun powder. A valve of typical design has a disc\n0.254 mm in thickness and 1.27 mm in diameter. A detonating charge uses explosive\nmaterials such as PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), or DDNP (diazodinitrophenol),\nor RDX (1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine).\n\nThe explosion of a charge is obtained by a transfer of mechanical or electrical\nenergy to a sensitive primer, such as lead styphnate. For this purpose, the charge is\nignited by striking a sharp blow to the primer through a metallic barrier, like the\nfiring pin of a gun, or by piercing abruptly the container of the primer by means of\na sharp probe, or by heating electrically the primer by means of a bridge-wire.\n\nThe ignition of a detonating or deflagrating charge may also be obtained without\nthe primer, by using an exploding bridge-wire (EBW). In this case, it is necessary to\nuse a firing pulse of several thousand volts, in comparison with a conventional firing\npulse of about 28 V or even less. An exploding bridge-wire is extremely insensitive\nto accidental firing, but requires a high voltage obtained by discharging a condenser\ncontained in a firing circuit.\n",
    "564": "5.18 Design of Explosive Valves 557\nA typical explosive cartridge (designed by Holex, Inc.), commonly used for explo-\nsive valves and having a low-voltage bridge-wire, is shown in the following figure,\nre-drawn from [25].\nSHOCK\nATTENUATOR\nPLUG\nBRIDGE-WIRE PRIMER CERAMIC SEAL\nCASE BODY CONNECTOR\n\\ \\ PINS\nao) a\noo) (6)\nrr a\n\u2014\n=\nROY]\nCo)\niS\nDee\nMAIN CHARGE\nTHREAD LOCK\nINDUCTION SOLDER SEAL\n\nThe charge in the cartridge shown above is ignited by means of an electrical\nconnector incorporated in the cartridge.

The cartridge contains 188 mg of deflagrating\ncharge, and the pressure generated by the ignition can be as high as 4.137 x 10\u00b0 N/m.\nThe shock attenuator plug incorporated in the cartridge weakens the shock waves\nbefore they reach the ceramic seals. The electrical conductors are two connector pins\nmade of stainless steel, and the case is made of the same material. The pins are locked\ninto the case by fused ceramic seals. The current necessary to ignite a cartridge like\nthis ranges from | to 5 A, and the firing time ranges from 1 to 20 ms [25].\n\nSome explosive valves are illustrated below. The following figure, due to the cour-\ntesy of NASA [43], shows a normally closed valve which opens when the explosive\ncharge actuates a pin (ram) which shears the end from the inlet fitting and retains it\nin a recess of the body.\n",

    "571": "564 6 Tanks for Propellants\n\nThe word shell is used here because, at any point of a tank, the thickness of its\nwall is assumed to be constant and much smaller than the radii of curvature of its\nmiddle surface [2].\n\nA surface of revolution results from rotating a plane curve about some straight\nline (called the axis of revolution) lying in the plane which contains the curve. A\nline resulting from the intersection of a surface of revolution with a plane containing\nthe axis of revolution is called a meridian. A line resulting from the intersection of\na surface of revolution with a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution is called\na circumference. Therefore, the meridian passing through any point of a surface of\nrevolution is perpendicular to the circumference passing through the same point. The\nstructural analysis of tanks which will be presented in this chapter is largely due to\nRoark\u2019s formulas for stress and strain [3].\n\nWhen a shell is subject to distributed loads resulting from internal or external\npressure, the predominant stresses acting on the shell are membrane stresses, which\nare stresses whose amount is constant through the thickness of the shell. Generally\nspeaking, the stresses acting in a point of a shell are\n\u00a2 ameridian membrane stress 0}, whose direction is parallel to the local meridian;\ne a circumferential membrane stress 72, whose direction is parallel to the local\n\ncircumference; and\n\u00a2 asmall radial stress 03, which varies through the thickness of the shell.\n\nIn addition to these stresses, there may be bending or shear stresses due to loading,\nor to physical properties of the shell, or to the supporting structure. The stresses\nconsidered above cause meridian, circumferential, and radial strains in a shell, and\ntherefore changes in the slopes if its meridians. The circumferences of a shell may\nalso deviate from their circular form when buckling occurs.\n\nWhen a thin shell (one whose thickness is less than one tenth of its smaller radius\nof curvature) has no abrupt changes in thickness, slope, or curvature, and is subject\nto a loading uniformly distributed or smoothly varying and axisymmetric, then\nthe meridian o; and circumferential 02 membrane stresses are practically uniform\nthrough the thickness of the wall, and are also the most important stresses acting on\nthe shell. The radial stress o3 and stresses induced by bending moments are negli-\ngible. In this case, the formulae of [3, Table 13.1] can be used to compute stresses\nand strains such as those described above for shells of cylindrical, conical, spherical,\nand toroidal shapes. Examples of application will be given in the following sections.\n6.2 Tanks Subject Only to Membrane Stresses\nTwo thin shells can be joined together to form a tank. When it is desired to have no\nbending stresses at the junction in case of uniformly distributed or smoothly varying\nloads, then it is necessary to choose shells such that the radial deformations AR and\nthe rotations w of the meridians be the same for each of them at the point of junction.\n",

Since the initial masses of these vehicles consist prin-\ncipally of liquid propellants, then the time-varying loads due to the motion of such\nmasses in their tanks are very large. The control systems and the structures of launch\nvehicles are to be designed in such a way as to respectively counteract and resist such\nloads.\n\nThe dynamical systems which describe the motion of liquid masses into moving\ncontainers are very complex, because of couplings of the components of such\nsystems. In particular, the natural frequencies of the control systems, of the elastic\nbodies, and of the liquid sloshing are to be kept separated as widely as possible,\nbecause large forces and moments can be generated by a liquid propellant oscillating\nat one of its natural frequencies in a partially filled tank. Unfortunately, such is not\nalways the case, as shown in the following table, adapted from [6], which refers to\nsome representative launch vehicles.\n\nCharacteristics of Some Representative Launch Vehicles\nFunda- | Funda-\nControl | mental |. mental\nVehicle ae Diam- | Thrust, | Range, | fre-_ | slosh fre. | bending | Important missions\nSten mir \u00a9 mete | tom, Hz | at litcot,\nHz\nRedstone.......| 21] 1.78 |1.432x10\u00b0| 3704| 0.5 0.8 10-12 | Exploration.\nRedstone- 25| 1.78 |1.432x10\"| 3704] 5 -8 10 | Suborbital manned\nMercury flights.\nJupiter.......--| 20 | 2.65 |3.925x10\"| 2778 4 \u201c6 9 | Reentry, recovery of\nmonkeys Able and\nBaker.\nJuno ......--| 25 | 2.65 }3.925x10\")....| 4 -6 8 | Moon try, Sun orbit.\nSatumL.......| 60] 6.5 |3.047%10\"|........| 3 -45 2| Manned space fight.\nSaturn V__...-. 130 | 10 1.512*10\" |..------ +16 |>0.3-0.4 1 | Manned space flight.\n* Large slosh masses in unfavorable locations.\n\u00bb Exceptionally large slosh masses because of the large tank diameter.\n\nBy sloshing we mean the periodic motion of the free surface of a liquid in a partially\nfilled container [7]. This motion results from longitudinal and lateral displacements\nor angular rotations of the vehicle carrying the container.\n\nIn particular, lateral sloshing is the standing wave formed on the free surface of\na liquid when a tank partially filled is caused to oscillate horizontally [8], that is,\n",
    "601": "594 6 Tanks for Propellants\nin a plane parallel to the free surface of the quiescent liquid. Lateral sloshing is\nantisymmetric, and occurs primarily in response to translational or pitching motions\nof atank. By contrast, vertical sloshing is symmetric, and occurs primarily in response\nto motions of a tank in the direction perpendicular to the free surface of the quiescent\nliquid. Rotational sloshing is a motion exhibiting an apparent swirling of a liquid\nabout a normal axis, and arising as an instability of the antisymmetric lateral sloshing\nnear resonance [6].\n\nThe tanks of space vehicles may be subject to oscillations for several causes, which\nact either separately or in combination. Some examples of these causes, identified\nby Abramson et al. [9], are\ne wind gusts during powered flight;\n\u00a9 programmed changes of attitude of the vehicle;\n\u00a9 control pulses for attitude stabilisation;\n\u00a9 separation impulses; and\ne elastic deformations of the vehicle.\n\nThe magnitude of the forces and moments due to sloshing depend upon\ne shape of the tank;\n\ne properties of the propellants;\n\ne damping;\n\n\u00a2 height of the propellant in the tank;\ne acceleration; and\n\ne perturbing motion of the tank.\n\nThe sloshing phenomenon and its consequence on the stability of a space vehicle\ncan be controlled by a proper design of the tank and by the addition of baffles, as will\nbe shown in Sect. 6.6. The shape of the tank has an influence on the natural sloshing\nfrequencies and modes, and on the response to the forced oscillations and to the\nforces and moments due to the presence of the propellant in the tank.

According to [7], slosh-\nsuppression devices include rigid-ring baffles, cruciform baffles, deflectors, flexible\nflat-ring baffles, floating cans, and positive-expulsion bags or diaphragms. A brief\ndescription of them is given below.\n\nThe most frequently used manner of providing slosh damping in a tank is to install\nbaffles in the tank. Such baffles are placed in points which are slightly below the level\nof the free surface of the liquid propellant at the times in which damping is required.\nThe baffles can be installed either for the sole purpose of providing slosh damping\nin a tank, or also for structural reasons, to be used as wall-stiffener rings. In the latter\ncase, their size is increased to provide the required damping.\n\nRigid-ring baffles are widely used as slosh-suppression devices. As has been\nshown in Sect. 6.5, the damping ratio \u00a2 provided by rigid-ring baffles in circular\ncylindrical tanks is expressed by the Miles formula [16] as follows\n\nw w\\]3/N\\3 d\n\n5 =2.83[2(2-\u2014)]'(2) exo(~4.65)\n\nR R R R\nwhich holds when the depth / of the liquid propellant is considerably greater than the\ncross-sectional radius R of the tank (h/R > 2). In the preceding formula, w is the width\nof the rigid-ring baffles, 7 is the amplitude of oscillation measured at the tank wall\nfrom the free surface of the quiescent liquid, and d is the depth of the baffle below\nthe free surface of the quiescent liquid. This formula is based on the assumption that\nthe baffle is completely submerged during a slosh cycle.\n\nA series of flat-ring baffles is the most frequently used slosh-suppression device in\ncircular cylindrical tanks. As has been shown in Sect. 6.5, damping ratios for a series\nof flat-ring baffles can be calculated by using the principle of linear superposition,\nwhen the spacing s between the baffles is greater than the width w of each baffle [10].\n\nDamping provided by baffles in tanks of other shapes than circular cylinders has\nalso been studied by several authors. An account of such studies is given in [6, 8]\nfor spherical, oblate and prolate spheroidal, and toroidal tanks. An experimental\ninvestigation was conducted by Sumner [18] to determine the slosh-suppression\neffectiveness of rigid and flexible flat-plate annular-ring baffles in spherical tanks\nsubject to oscillations in the horizontal plane. The baffles caused a variation in the\nfundamental frequency of oscillation, and were found most effective in reducing\nthe slosh forces and increasing the damping when the free surface of the quiescent\nliquid was slightly above the baffle, so that the latter remained submerged during\nthe oscillatory cycle of the liquid. The optimum baffle width to tank radius ratio was\nfound to be w/R = 0.125 for the spherical tanks considered. A side view of the baffles\nin the spherical tanks is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA\n[18].\n",

Such advantages concern\nhigher damping effectiveness and lower mass. An experimental study conducted by\nStephens and Scholl [20] for large-scale cylindrical tanks fitted with both flexible and\nrigid annular ring baffles has shown that slosh damping comparable to that provided\nby rigid baffles can be obtained by using smaller and less massive flexible baffles.\nStephens and Scholl have shown that the characteristics of the sloshing liquid, the\nflexibility of the baffles, and the damping can specified by three non-dimensional\nparameters.

The positive-expulsion devices\ntested were made of buty! rubber and ranged from 0.254 to 1.016 mm in thickness.\nThe excitation was impressed to the tank in the horizontal plane. The maximum slosh\nforces occurring at the first natural frequency increased with an increase in excitation\namplitude and decreased as the thickness of the diaphragm material increased. The\ndamping factor 6 was found to be essentially independent of the excitation amplitude\nand increased with an increase in the thickness of the diaphragm material. The second\nnatural mode force peak and the fluid swirl at the natural mode frequencies, which\nwere observed for the unrestricted liquid sloshing, were completely suppressed [23].\nThis type of slosh-suppression device has prevalently been used for spherical or\noblate spheroidal tanks [8].\n6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions\n\nof Tanks\n\nThe properties of the metallic materials to be considered in the evaluation and selec-\ntion phases of a given programme have been identified by Wagner and Keller [22]\nas follows:\n",
    "622": "6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 615\n\n\u00a9 strength/weight efficiency under load/temperature conditions or under other\ncritical failure conditions;\n\ne capability of being fabricated into the desired shapes and sizes without loss of\ntheir properties;\n\n\u00a9 compatibility with all anticipated environments;\n\ne fracture toughness and resistance to subcritical flaw growth;\n\ne availability of shapes and sizes within required schedules; and\n\n\u00a9 costs of materials and material processing and fabrication.\n\nThese properties are discussed below. The principal strength properties to be\nconsidered in the design of tanks for rocket vehicles are ultimate tensile strength\n(F,), which governs ultimate burst pressure under ductile failure conditions; tensile\nyield strength (Fy), to comply with the requirement of no yielding at limit load\nconditions or during proof testing; compressive yield strength (Fy), for compression-\ncritical structures; and the elastic properties (E, G, and v) of the materials. Further\nproperties are ultimate shear strength (F,,,), ultimate bearing strength (F;,,,,), and\nbearing yield strength (F;,y), which apply to design details, such as mechanical\nattachments, and are not usually important factors in the selection of materials. High-\nfrequency, low-stress fatigue data are sometimes required to evaluate the effects\nof structural vibrations. Low-frequency, high-stress fatigue data are often used to\nevaluate the effects of multiple pressurisation cycles.\n\nWagner and Keller [22] have also identified some variable parameters which can\naffect the mechanical properties of the materials used for tanks. These parameters are\ntemperature, thermal exposure, duration of loading, presence of biaxial and triaxial\nloads, rate of loading, and unusual environmental conditions such as corrosion and\nradiation.\n\nThe design properties of the materials are to be evaluated for the base metal, for the\nwelds, and sometimes also for the weld zones exposed to heat. It is also necessary to\nconsider the loading direction with respect to the grain orientation of the base metal,\nand the properties of the materials along and across the direction of the weld. The\neffects induced on the properties of the materials by processing, forming, and heat\ntreatments are also to be considered.\n\nThe metallic materials used for structures of aerospace vehicles form the subject\nof the military standards MIL-HDBK-SJ [25]. The welds form the subject of [26].\n\nA decrease in temperature tends to increase the strength of the material, but\noften decreases their ductility and toughness. In case of tanks containing cryogenic\npropellants, an increase in strength at low temperature is desirable, because it results\nin a mass reduction; however, it is also necessary in this case to ascertain whether\nthe fracture toughness of the material of which the tank is made is adequate to the\noperational and proof-testing conditions.\n\nLikewise, an increase in temperature tends to reduce the strength of the materials.\nThis fact is to be considered for materials which are particularly sensitive to temper-\nature, as is the case with some titanium alloys. Exposure of such materials to high\ntemperatures for long periods of time can cause a permanent reduction in strength.\n",
    "623": "616 6 Tanks for Propellants\n\nTanks for fluid propellants are required to withstand a high number (sometimes\nof the order of one hundred) of pressurisation cycles. Such cycles occur in testing\nand of course in service. Thank failures due to fatigue can occur as a result of these\nrepeated cycles.\n\nPressurisation stresses in tanks can also cause creep, which is a time-dependent\ndeformation of a material subject to prolonged stresses. Creep usually occurs at high\ntemperatures, but can also occur at moderately high temperatures for some titanium\nor aluminium alloys.\n\nThe multi-axial loading of metals can have significant effects on their mechanical\nproperties. The bi-axial tensile stresses acting in pressurised tanks may in some cases\nimprove, in other cases leave unchanged, and in other cases deteriorate the perfor-\nmance of the materials. Materials which are ductile, homogeneous, and isotropic may\nshow an increase in tensile strength, the amount of this increase depending on the\nbi-axial stress ratio. The maximum effects usually occurs at a bi-axial tensile-stress\nratio of 2:1.\n\nAs shown by experience, the magnitude of this effect is often of the order of that\npredicted by the von Mises criterion [27]. According to this criterion, the effective\nstress for yielding og in a material element subject to multi-axial loading is\n\n[* = 02)\u201d + (62 \u2014 03)\" + (03 \u2014 aa\nSef f= | oo?\n2\nwhere 01, 02, and 3 are the principal stresses, that is, the stresses acting along three\nmutually orthogonal planes of zero shear stresses (tT 2 = T23 = 73, = 0).\n\nAnisotropic materials do not conform to the von Mises criterion. Such is the case,\nfor example, with titanium processed in such a way as to obtain preferred orientations\nof the individual crystals or grains. For such materials, other yield criteria can be\nused, for example, the Hill 1948 criterion [28]. Further information on the Hill 1948\nand other criteria for anisotropic materials can be found in [29]. In addition, Wagner\nand Keller [22] point out that some homogeneous and isotropic alloys do not appear\nto behave in full accordance with the von Mises criterion.\n",
    "624": "6.7. Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 617\n\nThe strength of some materials may decrease when they are subject to biaxial\ntension. This effect may occur with low-elongation materials in a biaxial tensile-\nstress field. This state of stress is typical of spherical tanks, and limits the ductility of\nthe material to the plane which includes its thickness. In other planes, such materials\nin this state of stress tend to behave in a brittle manner [22].\n\nThe capability possessed by a material of being fabricated into the desired shapes\nand sizes without loss of its properties is one of the principal qualities considered\nin the design of tanks for aerospace vehicles. This is because not all high-strength\nmaterials can also be manufactured economically to form tanks having the desired\ncharacteristics. Some essential fabrication requirements, indicated by Wagner and\nKeller [22], are indicated below:\n\ne availability in suitable forms, sizes, and levels of quality within the necessary\nschedules;\n\ne capability of being formed, and machined to the required configurations, on the\navailable equipment, and at the appropriate thicknesses and strength level;\n\n\u00a9 capability of being welded to suit the common methods of assembly; and\n\n\u00a2 capability of meeting thermal processing requirements.\n\nSome guidelines to be followed by a designer to choose a method of fabrication\nfor a tank have been suggested by Whitfield and Keller [30]. A brief account is given\nbelow.\n\nThe method of fabrication chosen for a tank of a rocket engine should be reliable,\nrapid, and cost-effective for the particular case and needs of the programme to which\nit applies. A fabrication process should be selected so as to afford the best compro-\nmise between fabrication schedule and cost, without reducing reliability below a\ndesired level. An engineering study should include trade-off evaluations of fabrica-\ntion and welding processes, reliability of various processes based on past experience,\nschedule effects of material processing, and cost connected with fabrication, tools,\nand facilities.\n\nA comparison of methods of fabrication used for pressure-vessel components is\nshown in the following table, taken from [22].\n",

Desirable properties for a weldable metal are its capability of being\nfused without the formation of unwanted phases or constituents in or near the fusion\nzone, its ductility in the range from the melting temperature to room temperature (in\norder to resist cracking), strength, and fracture-resistance.\n\nGenerally speaking, according to NASA [34], the welding processes used for\nspace flight hardware are:\n",

This process was\ninvented and patented by The Welding Institute (a British research and technology\norganisation), and has been applied to aerospace, shipbuilding, aircraft, and auto-\nmotive industries. In particular, it has been used primarily for square butt welds in\naluminium alloys of the 2XXX series.\n\nCarter [35] has given some examples of application of Friction Stir Welding to\nthe aerospace industry.

    "627": "620 6 Tanks for Propellants\ne NASA\u2014Space Launch System core stage.\n\nOne of the principal benefits of this technology is that it allows welds to be made on\naluminium alloys which cannot be readily welded by fusion arc. An example of such\nalloys is the AI-Li 2195 alloy, which has been used for the Super Light Weight Tank\nof the Space Shuttle. A further benefit of Friction Stir Welding is that it has fewer\nelements than other welding techniques to control. In Friction Stir Welding there\nare only three process variables to control, namely, rotation speed, travel speed, and\npressure, all of which are easily controlled. The increase in joint strength combined\nwith the reduction in process variability resulted in an increased margin of safety\nand in a high degree of reliability for the external tank of the Space Shuttle.\n\nIn Friction Stir Welding, a dowel rotates at an angular velocity between 19 and\n31 rad/s [36], depending on the thickness of the material. The pin tip of the dowel is\nforced into the material under a pressure going from 3.4 x 107 to 6.9 x 107 N/m?\n[36]. The pin continues to rotate and moves forward at a speed going from 1.48\nto 2.12 mm/s [36]. As the pin rotates, friction heats the surrounding material and\nrapidly produces a softened plasticised area under the pin. Plasticity starts to occur\naround 700 K for most materials [37]. The temperature due to friction is carefully\ncontrolled not to exceed the point of turning the material to a liquid, which occurs\nat about 922 K in most cases [37]. As the pin travels forward, the material behind\nthe pin is forged under pressure from the dowel and consolidates to form a bond at\na molecular level.\n\nUnlike fusion welding, no actual melting occurs in this process, and the weld is\nleft in the same fine-grained condition as the original metal. For the external tank of\nthe Space Shuttle, a through-spindle retractable pin was developed, which can retract\nor expand its pin tip within the material. This allows for changes of thickness such as\non the longitudinal barrel of the tank [36]. The following figure, due to the courtesy\nof NASA [37], shows retractable pin tools used for the Friction Stir Welding process.\n\n| 3\n\nRetractable pin tools were developed by NASA engineers because the original\nFriction Stir Welding left a opening, known as a keyhole, which was a point of\nweakness in the weld. The retractable pin tool retracts automatically when the weld\n",
    "628": "6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 621\nis complete and prevents a keyhole. This improvement makes the weld stronger and\neliminates the need to fill the keyhole during manufacturing.\n\nApart from the choice of a particular welding technique, further processing, such\nas pre-heat or post-heat or both of them, is generally required for high-carbon, low-\nalloy steel welds when thickness is higher than 2.5 mm. However, pre-heat and\npost-heat may be required for welds of thickness equal to or less than 2.5 mm, in\norder to avoid weld cracking, depending on the material, on the welding process,\nand on the restraint characteristics of the particular weld. When pre-heat or post-\nheat is performed by using a torch, then oxidation can reduce the quality of the\nweld. To avoid this, automatic electric heating is desirable in many cases, because\nelectric heaters controlled by rheostats provide appropriate temperatures and uniform\nheating. Backup tools made of copper, stainless steel, or refractory-covered metals\nare used to achieve either high, or low, or negligible heat dissipation, as the case\nrequires, to control the final dimensions and properties of the weld [30]. A reduced\nstrength of a metal in or near the welding zone can be compensated for by increasing\nits thickness at the joints. Since ductility decreases in the welding zone, then welds\nare generally located away from high-stress zones. Such zones are those in which\na parallel or a meridian of a surface of revolution changes abruptly its radius of\ncurvature.\n\nResidual stresses can still be present in welded zones, unless appropriate steps\nare taken. For this purpose, such processes as pressure welding and forge welding\ncan reduce residual stresses to minimum values. Residual stresses should be relieved\nfrom materials used for tanks to avoid cracking, warping, and reduction of resistance\nto fatigue and fracture. To this end, such thermal processes as ageing for titanium\nand heat treatment for steel are applied. For example, the 18%-nickel maraging\nsteel (so called because its strengthening mechanism consists in transforming the\nalloy to martensite with subsequent age hardening) requires ageing after welding\nto acquire maximum mechanical properties in welds [22]. Annealing is sometimes\nrequired before or during forming of tank components. However, many of the mate-\nrials commonly used for tanks do not require heat treatments after welding, either to\nrestore mechanical properties or to relieve residual stresses.\n\nThe materials which are chosen for tanks of liquid-propellant rocket engines must\nbe compatible with the propellants contained.

    "630": "6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 623\n\ne hydrogen contamination at room temperature or at high temperatures;\n\ne oxygen and nitrogen contamination at high temperatures; and\n\ne halogen contamination, resulting from halide-containing materials, before heat\ntreatment or welding.\n\nTitanium contaminated by hydrogen or oxygen or nitrogen becomes brittle. This\nundesirable effect, when due to heat treatments in air, can sometimes be removed\nby machining. However, when a titanium alloy is welded in air, then the entire weld\nbecomes brittle.\n\nSteel can also become brittle when contaminated by hydrogen. This happens typi-\ncally in electrolytic processes. Steel becomes increasingly susceptible to contamina-\ntion due to hydrogen as its strength increases.\n\nOther type of alloys used for rocket tanks (such as aluminium alloys and alloys\nbased on nickel and cobalt) may, or may not, become brittle in various degrees when\ncontaminated by hydrogen, depending on temperature [22].\n\nFluids contained in rocket tanks can cause chemical reactions which results in\neither corrosion or reduced strength of the materials of which the tanks are made.\nThis holds with both testing fluids and propellants. Fluids commonly used for testing\npurposes are not dangerous by their nature, but may become dangerous as a result\nof contamination. Examples are tanks made of titanium alloys pressurised with\nmethanol, or made of steel pressurised with water [22].\n\nSome propellants are corrosive or chemically reactive. The containment of these\npropellants in tanks made of materials sensitive to chemical reactions is possible\nonly when a film or a layer of stable oxide protects the covered material from further\nreactions. In order to test the susceptibility of a given material to possible chemical\nattach due to a given propellant, it is necessary to conduct tests in the same conditions\nof pressure, temperature, and duration of exposure as those which will be experienced\nby the material in service.\n\nThe decomposition of some propellants may be accelerated by the catalysing\naction exerted by some metals. Examples of propellants subject to catalytic\ndecomposition are hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine.\n\nA tank whose external surface is exposed to atmospheric agents during part of\nthe life of a space vehicle is subject to moisture, salts, and chemical substances\nof industrial origin. This part includes the times of manufacturing, storage, testing,\ntransportation, and operation. Some metals used for tanks are resistant to atmospheric\ncorrosion, because of the formation of a thin layer of protective oxide. Such is the\ncase with titanium alloys, stainless steels and super-alloys having high percentages\nof nickel and chromium, and some aluminium alloys. Other alloys and steels must\nbe provided with a protective finish.\n\nThe reactions which occur in conditions of service between the tank materials\nand the fluids contained can be classified as follows\n\u00a9 stress-corrosion cracking;\n\ne galvanic corrosion;\n\u00a2 loss of ductility due to hydrogen; and\ne ignition.\n",
    "631": "624 6 Tanks for Propellants\n\nA brief description is given below for each type of reaction.\n\nAccording to the definition given in [38], stress-corrosion cracking is a cracking\nprocess caused by the conjoint action of stress and a corrodent. Stress-corrosion\ncracking is one of the principal causes of failure of high-stressed tanks. Corrosion\ncan be due to either the fluids contained in the tanks or the environments to which the\ntanks are exposed. The most common of such environments is atmospheric air, which\ncontains moisture, salts, and other chemical substances due to industrial processes.\nThe effects of stress-corrosion on a given material depend on the stress sustained by\nthe material, the degree of corrosion of the environment, and the time of exposure of\nthe material to the environment.\n\nMeans commonly used to avoid stress-corrosion cracking in tanks are\ne choice of materials resisting to corrosive environments or protection of susceptible\n\nmaterials from corrosive environments;\n\ne reduction of tensile stresses in materials exposed to corrosive environments; and\ne reduction of the times of exposure.\n\nThe matter of corrosion and protection of metals from corrosion forms the subject\nof the military standards MIL-HDBK-729 [39]. In particular, Table XIV on p. 127\nof [39] indicates the chemical composition of some titanium alloys used for tanks,\nand the related corrosive substances, for which stress-corrosion cracking has been\nobserved.\n\nIn particular, aluminium alloys of the 2XXX and 7XXX series are susceptible to\nstress-corrosion cracking in atmospheric environments. Titanium alloys are normally\nresistant to atmospheric environments, but are susceptible to salt and other sources\nof chlorine which remain in contact with the metals at temperatures above about\n561 K. Some titanium alloys have also been found to be susceptible to sea water at\nroom temperatures [22].\n\nA comparison of the resistance of various alloys to stress-corrosion cracking in\natmosphere and in other environments is given in Table VII on pp. 35 and 36 of [22].\n\nGalvanic corrosion, so called after the Italian scientist Luigi Galvani, is an elec-\ntrochemical phenomenon which occurs either on a macro-scale or on a micro-scale.\n\nOn a macro-scale, it is the increased corrosion (deterioration) of the more active\nmetal (anode) of a couple of dissimilar metals in an electrolytic solution or medium\nand the decreased corrosion of the less active metal (cathode) as compared to the\ncorrosion of the individual metals, when not connected, in the same electrolytic\nenvironment. By electrolytic solution, we mean a solution capable of conducting an\nelectric current. An example is common sea water.\n\nThe dissimilarity which provides the driving force to galvanic corrosion is the\ndifference in the electrode potential of each of the two metals when they are in elec-\ntrical contact through the electrolyte. Electrode potential is a measure of the tendency\nof a metal to become more active than another metal when they are immersed in a\ngiven electrolyte.\n\nA galvanic series is a list of metals and alloys based on their order and tendency to\ncorrode independently in a particular electrolytic solution or in other environment.\n",

When galvanic corrosion occurs on a micro-scale, the anodic\nand cathodic areas can only be discerned by metallographic techniques or deduced\nby inference or observations of the corroded metal [39].\n\nGalvanic corrosion can occur within a tank containing an electrically conductive\nfluid, or outside a tank exposed to atmospheric moisture. Generally speaking, in\nliquid-propellant rocket engines, galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals is of little\nor no concern, because most propellants either have little electrical conductivity,\nor do not develop significant electrode potentials in contact with normal structural\nmetals, or both [22]. However, this problem may arise when new or inadequately\ntested propellants are used either alone or in the presence of contaminants, or when\nliquids other than propellants (for example, water) are in contact with dissimilar\nmetals.\n\nMetals can be protected from corrosion by providing them with a coating or a\ntreatment. The coating may be a paint, a sealant, a resin coating, or a metallic coating.\nSeveral types of coatings, used to protect specific metals, are described at length in\n[42]. The treatment may be a surface or bulk treatment, a chemical or mechanical\ntreatment, or a combination of these.\n\nSome metals effectively resist corrosion damages because of their ability to form\nand maintain, when exposed to an aggressive environment, an adherent and imper-\nvious film. These metals are said to have become passivated. However, many of the\ncommon or structural metals used for tanks are either scarcely efficient or unable in\nproducing such protective films. Consequently, protective coatings or treatments are\napplied to many common metals to prevent or reduce corrosion [39].\n\nMetals which are in contact with pure hydrogen should be evaluated for suscepti-\nbility to loss of ductility in the presence of hydrogen. This phenomenon, also known\nas hydrogen-assisted fracture, is due to the easy absorption and subsequent diffusion\nof hydrogen into metals. On a microscopic scale, hydrogen atoms tend to segregate in\ncertain parts of the crystal lattice of a metal, thereby weakening its chemical bonds.\nConsequently, the walls of a metallic tank containing hydrogen become brittle, which\ncan lead to failure.\n\nThe compatibility of metals with hydrogen has been investigated by several\nauthors. Some of them are Cataldo [43], Caskey [44], San Marchi and Somerday\n[45], and Chandler [46]. A brief account is given below.\n\nBrittleness of metals due to hydrogen occurs principally in ferrous alloys, such\nas high-strength and martensitic steels. In most cases, the greater the strength of a\nmetal, the more susceptible it is to brittleness caused by hydrogen. Low-strength\nmetals, such as copper, aluminium, and nickel alloys, have low susceptibility to\n",

However, in case of these metals having undergone a strain-\nhardening process, there would be a greater risk of induced brittleness.\n\nIn some cases, steels and alloys of low strength can be used to decrease the risk\nof loss of ductility.

These defects can reduce the capability\nof carrying loads and the operational life of the tanks. When such defects are large\nin comparison with those causing failure, then failure occurs as soon as the tanks\nare put under pressure for test purposes. When such defects are small, the tanks\nmay withstand several cycles of pressure loading for a considerable number of hours\nbefore the size of the defects grows to such an extent as to cause failure.\n\nIt is necessary, for reasons of economy, to reduce the possibility of failure of tanks\nused for a space vehicles during testing. It is mandatory, for reason of both safety\nof the crew and economy, to reduce the possibility of failure of such tanks during\noperation.\n\nThe present section presents criteria and practices to be used in the design of\nmetallic tanks for propellants, in order to reduce the possibility of failures caused by\ndefects during test, pre-flight, and flight.\n\nFor this purpose, it is necessary to consider:\n\ne the initial sizes of the flaws;\n\ne the critical sizes of the flaws (meaning by that, the sizes required to cause fracture\nat a given level of stress); and\n\n\u00a2 the subcritical characteristics of the flaws which can cause their growth.\n\nTo prevent failures during test, the initial sizes of the flaws must be less than\nthe critical sizes at the level of stress given to the material in test phase. To prevent\nfailures during service, it must be proven that the largest possible size of an initial\nflaw in a tank cannot grow to the critical size during the required operational life of\nthe tank.\n\nThe critical size of a flaw depends on the level of stress, on the toughness of the\nmaterial to fracture, on the thickness of the wall, and on the location and direction\nof the flaw. The determination of the initial size of a flaw is limited by the available\nmethods of non-destructive inspection. However, further information may come from\nthe results of a successful proof test. In other words, a proof test in which a tank has\nnot failed provides information on the maximum possible value of the ratio of the\ninitial to critical stress level. This value, in turn, makes it possible to estimate the\nmaximum possible size of the initial flaws.\n",

When a tank has an initial flaw whose\nsize exceeds the critical size at the level of stress applied in testing, then the tank\nfails just in phase of testing.

Non-destructive inspection is\nthe only means of determining the actual initial flaw sizes. A successful proof test\nprovides a measure of the maximum possible initial-to-critical stress intensity ratio,\nand this in turn makes it possible to estimate the maximum possible initial flaw sizes.\n\nNon-destructive inspection techniques commonly used for rocket tanks are radio-\ngraphic testing, ultrasonic testing, liquid penetrant testing, and magnetic particle\ntesting. Other techniques are eddy current testing and infrared testing [47].\n\nWhen multiple inspection techniques (for example, radiographic testing, ultra-\nsonic testing, and liquid penetrant testing) are used, then most surface and internal\nflaws are detected. However, it is not safe to assume that all existing flaws can be\ndetected at any time, because some of them (for example, tight cracks) are particu-\nlarly difficult to detect. The largest initial flaw sizes which cannot escape detection\ncannot be established with confidence. The inspection techniques commonly used\ndo not measure precisely the lengths and the depths of the initial flaws to be used\nin a fracture mechanics analysis. However, it is necessary to rely on non-destructive\ninspection to prevent proof-test failures of most high-strength tanks [47].\n\nProof-pressure testing is probably the most reliable non-destructive inspection\ntechnique available to ensure the absence of initial flaws of sufficient sizes to cause\nfailure of a tank in operating conditions.

When the applied stress approaches\nand exceeds the yield strength of the material, the critical flaw-size curve deviates\nfrom the theoretical curve based on a constant value of K;,, and therefore the critical\nflaw sizes are smaller than those predicted by the linear-elastic theory of fracture\nmechanics.\n\nWhen the stress applied to a tank at proof pressure exceeds the yield strength\nof the material and the tank also passes the proof test, then the maximum possible\nvalue of the ratio K;;/K;. resulting from the test is smaller than 1/a.

    "644": "6.8 Fracture Control of Metals Used for Tanks 637\n\nSome criteria to be observed in the design of metallic tanks for rocket engines\nhave been identified by Tiffany [47]. They may be summarised as follows. All tanks\nmust be designed to avoid failure in service caused by flaws and to ensure a very\nlow probability of catastrophic failure caused by flaws during proof tests. For this\npurpose, it is necessary to consider not only the internal pressure to which a tank\nis subject, but also the pressures, temperatures, environments, and stresses to which\nthe tank is exposed.\n\nThe materials used for tanks must have appropriate characteristics of fracture-\ngrowth and flaw-growth. These characteristics must come from reliable sources of\ndata, for example, from the military standards MIL-HDBK-5 J [25], and must also\nbe confirmed by tests.\n\nThe critical flaw sizes must be determined for the stress levels of interest by\neither analysis or tests, as appropriate. If possible, the maximum size of initial flaws\nallowable in tanks should be so great as to be detected by non-destructive inspection,\nbut not so great as to grow to critical size during life in service.\n\nThe allowable initial size of flaws must be less than the critical size at the level of\nstress of proof pressure. The initial stress intensity ratio allowable in a tank must be\nchosen to ensure that the critical intensity ratio is not attained during the design life\nof the tank.\n\nEach tank must be proof tested. The level of proof pressure must be chosen to\ndemonstrate that the tank is free of flaws larger than the allowable initial size, or that\nthe actual initial stress-intensity ratio is less than the allowable initial stress-intensity\nratio. Account must be taken of the differences between the proof test temperature\nand the service temperature, and of the time required to apply or remove pressure\nduring the proof test.\n\nIn order to prevent failures in proof tests, low levels of stress and materials having\nhigh values of fracture toughness must be used during such tests. By so doing, the\ncritical sizes of flaws are large and greater than the thickness of the tank walls.\nConsequently, the worst case which can occur during proof testing is leakage. In\norder to obtain maximum assurance of safe performance in service, it is desirable to\nuse large proof-test factors, low levels of operational stresses, and materials having\nlow rates of flaw growth under cyclic loads and high values of K 7, in the expected\nenvironment of service.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of large proof-test factors, low levels of operational\nstresses, and materials having high values of fracture toughness leads often to high\nmasses of tanks. Therefore, trade-offs can and should be made to arrive to an optimum\ncompromise for a given tank.\n\n6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks\nThe structural elements considered in the present section are tank shells, weld joints,\naccess openings, support fittings, and accessory attachment provisions.\n",
    "645": "638 6 Tanks for Propellants\n\nNot only the tank shells but also the other elements are required to withstand\ninternal and external pressures, the latter acting during propellant servicing or during\ndecontamination. Vacuum is frequently used to remove gas from the liquid side of\nexpulsion devices (described in Sect. 6.6), and also to remove residual propellants\nfrom tanks. The tank shells and the other elements are required to withstand an\nexternal pressure of one atmosphere (101325 N/m7).\n\nOne of the principal requirements of tanks for rocket engines is low mass. Other\nrequirements are cost, schedule times, easiness of manufacturing, reliability and\navailability of the materials used for them, technical skills of the personnel, tools,\nand testing facilities.\n\nIn the phase of structural design, the detailed design of a tank includes sidewall,\nfore and aft bulkheads, access openings, and accessory mounting provisions. The\ndesign of these elements depends on the material chosen for the tank. The detailed\ndesign of a tank also includes the primary structural junctures.\n\nThe design of a tank is based on the relation between the loads imposed and the\ncapability of the tank to withstand such loads. Wagner and Keller [22] have identified\nthe following factors to be taken into account in the analysis of the loads imposed\non a tank:\n\ne limit load or stress, which is the maximum stress or pressure which the tank struc-\nture is expected to bear, in the specified operating conditions and with allowance\nfor possible variations;\n\ne design safety factor, which is a multiplier, whose value (greater than unity) is\nchosen by the designer to take account of small variations of the properties of the\nmaterial, of the quality of manufacturing, and of the magnitude and distribution\nof the load in the structure;\n\ne design load or stress, which is the limit load multiplied by the design safety factor;\n\ne allowable load or stress, which is the load not to be exceeded to avoid failure, the\nlatter being due to either buckling, or yield, or ultimate loading; and\n\ne margin of safety (m,), which is the fraction by which the allowable load exceeds\nthe design load, as follows\n\nallowable load or stress 1\nms = (limit load or stress) x (design safety factor)\n\nThe magnitude of the design safety factor depends on the degree of confidence in\nthe properties of the materials, on the processes of production, and on the validity of\nthe predicted conditions of use. In practice, a uniform design safety factor is chosen\nby the designer for the entire structure of a rocket vehicle on the basis of experience\nand judgement. Values in use for the design safety factor range from 1.0 to 1.1 for\nyield stress and from 1.25 to 1.5 for ultimate stress, the higher values being used for\nmanned flight vehicles.\n\nThe structure of a rocket tank is required to withstand the stresses due to vibration,\nthermal shock, propellant slosh, and internal pressure. This structure is also required\n",

The meridian stresses are determined by combining the ullage pressure,\nthe axial loads, and the bending moments.\n\nThe stresses acting on the end closures of a tank result from the ullage pressure and\nthe acceleration impressed on the propellant. During the boost time, the aft bulkheads\nof tanks have a maximum pressure at the apex, and the forward bulkheads have a\nminimum pressure at the apex. In order to evaluate the stress at a specific location\non the end closures, the pressure and the shape of the closure must be considered.\n\nWhen there are separate bulkheads on two contiguous tanks, the load acting on\neach of them is to be determined as indicated above for end closures of tanks.\n",
    "647": "640 6 Tanks for Propellants\n\nA single common bulkhead is subject to either burst or collapse loads and to\ntemperature gradients through its thickness. The pressure loads acting at any given\npoint of a common bulkhead are determined as described above for end closures of\ntanks, but a common bulkhead is subject only to the difference between the forward\npressure and the aft pressure acting at any given point. The stability under collapsing\npressure loads is obtained by designing a bulkhead of large bending stiffness in\ncomparison with its membrane stiffness. A stiffened skin for a tank requires a more\ncomplex analysis of internal loads. In this case, a multi-layer shell of revolution is\nfrequently used.\n\nA tank is also subject to local loads at any point in which it is mated to other\ncomponents of a rocket vehicle. The magnitudes and the directions of these loads\ndepend on the weight of each component multiplied by an amplification factor due to\nacceleration and vibration. The magnitude of these loads is felt to its full extent by the\nattachment bolts and by the immediate structural elements. It is felt to a lesser extent\nby the contiguous structural elements. This lower magnitude is evaluated according\nto criteria suggested by experience and judgement, taking account of the damping\nwhich occurs away from the point of excitation.\n\nIn most cases, tanks for liquid-propellant rocket engines are thin-walled surfaces\nof revolution, meaning by that, structures whose thickness \u00a2 is assumed constant and\nmuch smaller than the radii R of curvature of its middle surface [2]. In practice, the\nvalue of R/t is assumed greater than 10. As has been shown in the first four sections\nof the present chapter, this assumption permits the use of simple formulas for stress\nand strain, such as those which are given in [3].\n\nThe choice of the materials and the evaluation of the corresponding thicknesses\nand stresses can be done by using only data on mechanical properties with safety\nfactors selected by the designer. Of course, practical considerations concerning manu-\nfacturing, handling, and stiffness are also taken into account in this preliminary\nchoice. Before this choice can take place, the level of stress in working condition,\nthe thickness of the skin, and the fracture strength of the materials must be evaluated.\nThe proposed material must possess appropriate values of toughness and resistance\nto the growth of subcritical flaws, in order to comply with the requirements of life\nservice for a given tank.\n\nAfter a material has been chosen, the proof-test stress, the operational stress,\nand the non-destructive inspection requirements are defined according to the desired\nmission performance. The skin thickness is determined by taking account of the\nmost restrictive conditions, such as safety factor, criteria of fracture control, manu-\nfacturing, and handling. The skin thickness for the sidewall of a tank depends on the\nproduct of the circumferential tension load under the predicted maximum pressure\ntimes the factor of safety [22]. In order to reduce mass, the skin thickness should\nbe as low as possible. There are several methods for constructing thin-walled tanks.\nSometimes, a tank can be put under internal pressure to keep its walls from buckling.\nThis is because the net tensional force due to internal pressure is made greater than the\ncompressional force due to the flight loads. Consequently, the tank is only subject to\ntension, and buckling is avoided. Such was the case with the Atlas and Centaur launch\nvehicles, in which additional membrane rigidity was obtained through the internal\n",

This\n\nmethod was used for the external skin structure of the Delta launch vehicle [51].\n\nSummarising, the sidewall skin is usually stiffened against buckling by using\nstringers, frames, or ribs spaced in a grid pattern (either isogrid or rectangular waffle).\nThe sidewall design is particularly important for tanks of large space vehicles. This\nis because the sidewall in such vehicles not only contains the propellant but also\ntransmits the body loads. The principal types of sidewall designs for tanks under\npressure are skin-stringer-frame, grid, and monocoque.\n\nThe choice of one or another type of design for a tank depends on the magnitude\nof the body loads applied externally and on the type of propellant to be contained\nin the tank. A highly loaded sidewall is usually designed with the skin-stringer-\nframe structure, whereas a lightly loaded sidewall is designed with the waffle or\nisogrid structure. A very lightly loaded sidewall can be designed with the monocoque\nstructure, but pressurising is often required for stability.\n\nIntegral stiffening is the type of skin-stringer design which is best suited to propel-\nlant tanks [22]. This type of design eliminates the many sources of possible leakage\nassociated with the points of mechanical attachment involving the skin, the stringers,\nand the frames constructed in the conventional manner.\n\nThe following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22], shows two types of\nskin-stringer designs.

The stringer spacing depends on the local requirements\nof stability. The stringer configuration and the frame spacing for tanks of minimum\nmass depend on general requirements of stability under axial compressive loads\ncombined with internal pressures.\n\nThe material used for a sidewall of skin-stringer-frame design must be readily\nmachinable and must also have good forming and welding properties. Compensation\nshould be made by increasing the thickness at the weld joints, because the design\nstrength of a weld is generally taken lower than the strength of the original material.\nThe stringer spacing should be designed so as to keep the skin from buckling at limit\nload, account being taken of the buckling data of the curved panel and also of the\nstabilising effect of the internal pressure.\n\nThe following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22], shows a typical sidewall\ndesign used successfully for the liquid-hydrogen tank of the Saturn S-II stage.\n\nBS\nGEE SS\nSSS Numerics machine\nawh ht Ele eiry, SS milled quarter section\natt jf HTTP aS\nATT a Hit\na 5 5 i Swinger\na eae at Vertical weld\n\"3 Ge\nInsulation a L 3\nTypical cylinder section qj {\nCurcumterential\nweld tine\n",

The preceding figure illustrates two types,\n(a) and (b), of weld land for aluminium alloys 2014-T6 and 2219-T87, which are\nmaterials commonly used for propellant tanks. The thickness t,,.jq of a weld land is\ngreater, by a factor ranging from 2 to 2.25, than the thickness f,4i, of the skin. The\nwidth d of a weld land ranges from 32 to 51 mm. The stepped or tapered termination\n(type b) of a weld land has the advantage, over the abrupt termination (type a), of\navoiding bending stresses and strength reduction where the skin meets the weld land\n[22].\nThe following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22], shows some pre-weld\njoint preparations which have proven satisfactory for tank design.\n",

Post-weld processing of tanks is limited\nto ageing, to relieve internal stresses caused by welding. This is because heat treat-\nments after welding could induce distortion and oxidation, and also because complex\nequipment would be needed for that effect.\n\nJunctures are also needed in a tank between bulkhead and sidewall and between\nskirt and sidewall. These junctures are usually made at a common location with an\nappropriate fitting. A fitting commonly used is a Y-ring, so called due to its shape,\nwhich has been used for the Saturn I-C and for the Titan IL. A Y-ring fitting is shown\nin the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22].\n",

When the basic structure is of sufficient\nthickness, then the bosses are integrally milled with the basic structure. When the\nbasic structure is a thin shell, then the use of integral bosses requires a material of\nlarger initial thickness and a more extensive milling.\n\nBosses can also be fabricated by welding a circular machined ring, containing\nthe bosses, to the bulkhead. However, this method induces residual stresses in the\nmaterial as a result of the welding process.\n\nNon-integral support provisions are machined fittings, such as ports, flanges, and\nsupport pads, which are welded to the tank skin. For this purpose, it is necessary to\nprovide a material whose thickness is greater than the thickness of the tank skin, in\norder compensate for the loss of strength due to welding. Otherwise, for the same\nreason, it is necessary to lower the permissible operating pressure of the tank. In tanks\nfor liquid propellants, a single access opening is frequently used. This is obtained by\nusing a close-out cover which contains the lines for input and output. When multiple\ntanks are connected in series, the inlet lines are connected to standpipes within the\ntanks, in order to preclude reverse flow of propellant and to ensure feed-out in series.\n\nOpenings and access doors are ports and access points in the skin of a tank.

The method marked with (b) uses\na bulkhead boss of large cross-sectional area, in order to force most of the load to\nremain in the bolting ring instead of going through the door. The method marked\nwith (c) uses a door ring placed above the apex of the bulkhead, and has been chosen\nfor the forward door of the Centaur rocket stage.\n",

Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket\n\nEngine\n\nPropellant-supply ducts convey the fuel and the oxidiser from their tanks to the\nrespective turbo-pumps. These ducts, due to their location at the centre of an engine\ngimbal, are subject to bending and torsional loads. They are also subject to internal\npressure, due to the fluids carried by them. The principal requirement for propellant-\nsupply ducts is to keep the pressure losses between the tank outlets and the pump\ninlets to the minimum possible value. As a result of the many forces acting upon\nthese ducts, restrainers against buckling are frequently required. Such restrainers, if\nlocated inside the ducts, contribute to undesired pressure losses. On the other hand, the\nexternal location of the restrainers increases the duct size and may create problems of\ninterference of the ducts with other components of the engine.

The bellows is\nthin-walled (0.254 mm) and over 2540 mm long. It has 40 deep corrugations stacked\nin a 31.75 mm height. Flanges encompass the bellows and permit the application of\nonly torsional deflections. The joint is substantially a torsion spring of low elastic\nconstant, which can absorb torsional rotations up to 2/60 rad or 3\u00b0 [1].\n\nThe manufacturer of a rocket vehicle must know the sizes of the connecting\nflanges, the types of gasket used, and the forces transmitted by the engine ducts to\nthe vehicle when the engine is gimballed. This information is provided by the engine\ndesigner. In pump-feed rocket engines, the working relative pressure of propellant-\nsupply ducts ranges from 0.3447 x 10\u00b0 N/m? to 0.6895 x 10\u00b0 N/m? and over. In\npressure-fed rocket engines, the working absolute pressure of the propellant ducts is\nless than 3.447 x 10\u00b0 N/m?

These ducts also\ncontain bellows components. However, some engines have also had rigid (instead\nof flexible) components, as shown in following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA\n[1].\n\n(FUEL PUMP)\na eS ela.\nCe BAR\nSZ yi\n=| an\nli bot\u2019\nA. ah pe eS\nL PSA\\ U RIGID ALUMINUM | u -\\ vs\n| a WZ\n.

The design of such lines depends\non the mating connexions on the vehicle side, on the type of gas used, and on its\ntemperature and pressure.\n\nCryogenic-propellant bleed lines are used in cryogenic-propellant engines feed by\nturbo-pumps. This is because adverse conditions for such engines may occur during\nstart, when the metallic walls containing cryogenic fluids are at insufficiently low\ntemperatures, and also when the cryogenic fluids downstream of the tank outlet are\nsuperheated. In addition, the pressure which opens the main valves and starts the\nturbo-pumps reduces further the static pressure at the inlet of the turbo-pumps, and\nthis accelerates the production of gas. This, in turn, may lead to cavitation in the\npumps and to malfunction of the gas generator.\n\nIn order to avoid such undesirable events, a continuous bleed from a point farthest\ndownstream of the pump inlet is applied before engine start. By so doing, fresh\nliquid at the bulk temperature of the tank replaces continuously the warming fluid\nand cools the metallic walls of the containers.

In case of cryogenic-propellant engines used for upper\nstages of rockets, a re-circulation system is used, which re-directs the propellants to\ntheir tanks instead of dumping them overboard. Flexible lines between the engine\nand the rocket vehicle are required for this purpose. In order to reduce bleeds and\nre-circulating flows, it is possible to provide the rocket vehicle with means (such as\ncooling, thermal insulation, etc.) apt to keep the bulk temperatures of the propellants\nsufficiently below their boiling temperatures at the operating pressures in the tanks.\n\nPurge lines are required for rocket engines. This is due to the necessity of\nperforming purges during the start and shutdown sequence, and also before and after\nservicing, to keep the engines dry. These purges are executed by using non-reactive\ngases, such as nitrogen at ambient temperature, in order to prevent the formation of\ncombustible mixtures, and to expel residual propellants.\n\nAs an example, for the F-1 engine, a gaseous nitrogen purge is applied for thermal\nconditioning and for elimination of explosive mixtures under the engine envelope.\nSince low temperatures may exist in the space between the engine and its envelope\nfor thermal insulation, then heated nitrogen is applied to this space. This purge is\nmanually operated, whenever there is a prolonged hold of the countdown with liquid\noxygen onboard and with an ambient temperature below approximately 286 K. This\npurge is turned off five minutes prior to ignition command and is continued during\nthe time of umbilical connexion.\n\nA continuous nitrogen purge is also required to expel propellant leakage from the\nseal housing of the liquid-oxygen turbo-pump and from the liquid-oxygen injector\nof the gas generator. The pressure of the purging gas improves the properties of the\nliquid-oxygen seal. This purge is required from the time at which the propellants are\nloaded and is continuous throughout flight.\n\nA nitrogen purge prevents contaminants from accumulating on the viewing\nsurfaces of the radiation calorimeter. This purge is started 52 s before scheduled\nlift-off time and is continued during flight.\n\nA gaseous nitrogen purge is required to prevent contaminants from entering the\nliquid-oxygen system through the liquid-oxygen injector of the main engine or the\nliquid-oxygen injector of the gas generator. This purge is started prior to engine\noperation and is continued during the time of umbilical connexion.\n\nAt approximately 13 h before scheduled lift-off time, an ethylene glycol solution\nfills the thrust tubes and the manifolds of the engine.

When the engine starts, hydraulic pressure\nis generated by the turbo-pump of the engine.\n\nPressure from either source is made available to the engine valves, such as the main\nfuel and liquid-oxygen valves and the igniter fuel valve. These valves are sequenced\nand controlled by the terminal countdown sequencer, stage switch selector and by\nmechanical and fluid pressure means. Fluid under pressure also flows through a filter,\nshown in the preceding figure, and to the two flight control servo-actuators on each\noutboard engine.

Still in other rocket engines, high-pressure hot-gas ducts are required to\nconnect the tap-off ports of the thrust chamber with the turbine. Such is the case with\nengines (the J-2S, for one) based on the thrust chamber tap-off cycle, which has been\ndescribed in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.7. High-pressure hot-gas ducts have rigid portions and\nalso flexible portions, which are made of stainless steels and nickel-based alloys apt\nto resist temperatures up to about 1200 K.

These gases may be ducted either to a region near the exit plane of the nozzle\nor to a manifold of the thrust chamber. By the way, a manifold is a duct having one or\nmore branches off the main flow stream. Common types are T-shaped and Y-shaped\nmanifolds. The main function of a manifold is to distribute flow from one or more\ninlet passages to one or more outlet passages.

This joint connects the thrust chamber to the thrust\nstructure (described above) of the rocket vehicle.\n\nA turbo-pump structure is used to fasten the turbo-pumps to either the thrust\nchamber or other structural elements, such as the thrust structure. The turbo-pump\nmounts are the connexions between the turbo-pump assembly and the engine. These\nmounts support the loads due to the weight of the turbo-pump assembly and also react\nto the loads due to engine inertia, propellant inertia, engine gimballing, differences\nof pressure in fluids, forces on the flanges, and gyroscopic forces. In addition, the\nturbo-pump mounts adapt to the differential thermal expansion or contraction of the\nturbo-pump assembly and of the thrust chamber assembly [9].\n\nThe most common types of turbo-pump mounts use struts having at least one ball-\njoint end connexion to accommodate dimensional tolerances and differential thermal\nexpansion or contraction. Ball-ended struts can be arranged triangularly, to yield the\nlightest structure by loading its members in pure compression or tension. Another\narrangement consists of close-coupled, rigid pads at one end of the turbo-pump,\nand one or two ball-ended struts at the other end to accommodate the dimensional\nvariations [9].\n\n7.3 Materials Used for Tubing in Rocket Engines\n\nThe 18-8 (18% chromium and 8% nickel) corrosion-resistant steels are the most\nfrequently used materials for lines and bellows in rocket engines. Nickel-base alloys,\nsuch as those of the Inconel\u00ae and Hastelloy\u00ae families, are also used for ducts and\nbellows, because of their higher strengths, greater fatigue lives, and better corrosion\nresistances. Aluminium alloys are used in some non-critical or low-stress appli-\ncations. Due to forming requirements, only high-ductility alloys in the annealing\ncondition are used for corrugated sections [1].\n\nBellows-joint restraining brackets for cryogenic propellants are made of metals\nhaving face-centred cubic structure, which have high toughness at low temperatures.\nRestraining brackets for storable propellants are made of high-strength steels having\nbody-centred cubic or face-centred cubic structure.\n\nFlexible hoses, including wire braid, are made of 321 CRES, which is a stabilised\naustenitic stainless steel with addition of titanium.\n\nOther alloys, such as Hastelloy\u00ae C and Inconel\u00ae 718, are used for applications in\nspecial environments.\n\nMaterials used for tubing in rocket engines are chosen according to criteria of\nchemical compatibility with fluids, physical and mechanical properties, formability,\nweldability, and costs. These criteria have been considered at length in Chap. 6,\nSect. 6.7 for propellant tanks. A brief account is given here for what concerns\nspecifically fluid-carrying ducts and their flexible components.\n",
    "679": "672 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures\n\nAs to chemical compatibility of fluids with tubing materials, gaseous hydrogen at\nhigh pressure causes a loss of ductility in many metallic alloys. This effects depends\non the temperature, pressure, and purity of the gas, and also on the exposure time\nand level of stress.\n\nFerritic, martensitic, and bainitic steels, nickel-base alloys, and titanium alloys\nbecome brittle when exposed to pure hydrogen at room temperature, this effect being\nhigher at increasing pressure. High-strength alloys are often more susceptible than\nlow-strength alloys to loss of ductility.\n\nAustenitic stainless steels such as 310 and 316, some aluminium alloys such\nas 6061-T6, 2219-T6, and 7075-T73, pure copper and beryllium copper, and the\nprecipitation-hardened stainless steel A-286 are slightly affected. Inconel\u00ae 718,\nInconel\u00ae X-750, Waspaloy\u00ae, and Ren\u00e9\u00ae 41 are highly susceptible to loss of ductility\nwhen exposed to gaseous hydrogen at high pressure [1].\n\nThe loss of ductility due to hydrogen is associated with a loss of fracture toughness.\nThe presence of hydrogen, water vapour, and other gases increases the effects of crack\ninitiation and crack growth rate.\n\nIn addition to hydrogen, substances which can have undesirable effects on metallic\ntubing are:\n\ne propellants susceptible to catalytic decomposition, such as anhydrous hydrazine,\nmono-methy]l-hydrazine, and Aerozine 50, which generate hot gas in the presence\nof molybdenum, iron, copper, or silver;\n\n\u00a9 nitric acid resulting from absorption of water in nitrogen tetroxide, which attacks\naluminium alloys;\n\ne chlorides from cleaning fluids, which can induce stress-corrosion cracking in\nstainless steel 321 CRES; and\n\ne uninhibited (brown) nitrogen tetroxide, which can induce corrosion cracking in\ntitanium alloys.\n\nIt is also necessary to take account of the environment to which metals used for\ntubing are exposed. For example, titanium exposed to oxygen can ignite and oxidise\nexplosively as a result of an impact.\n\nThe principal physical and mechanical properties of metals used for tubing are\nstrength, elongation, and density.\n\nMinimum bend radius and fatigue resistance are desirable properties in materials\nto be used for corrugated walls of bellows. Cryogenic temperatures reduce the tough-\nness of most materials having body-centred cubic structure. Data of some metals and\nnon-metals exposed to low temperatures (from 20.37 to 533.15 K) are given in [10].\n\nSome materials used for flexible lines are aluminium alloy 6061-T6, stainless\nsteel 321 CRES, Hastelloy\u00ae C, Inconel\u00ae 625, titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V annealed,\nand Inconel\u00ae 718 age-hardened. The principal physical and mechanical properties\nof these materials are given in Table 3, page 45, of [1].\n\nThe materials to be used for flexible parts of interconnecting ducts must be chosen\nwith more demanding requirements than the materials for the remaining parts. Among\nthese requirements, the most important are those of formability, and resistance to\ncorrosion and fatigue. In particular, the materials chosen for bellows corrugations or\n",
    "680": "7.3. Materials Used for Tubing in Rocket Engines 673\ninner cores of flexible hoses must be ductile. Corrosion resistance is also required\nfor these materials in order to avoid holes and cracks which can give rise to leakage.\nFatigue resistance is required in order for a bellows to bear the desired number of\nflexural cycles. Materials which have shown good properties of strength-to-weight\nratio, weldability, and elongation are Inconel\u00ae 718, Nitronic\u00ae 40 (a high-manganese\nstainless steel with high strength and excellent resistance to corrosion at high temper-\natures), and 321 and 347 CRES. In particular, the Nitronic\u00ae 40 alloy is scarcely\naffected by loss of ductility due to hydrogen.\n\nBolts and nuts for aerospace applications are usually made of corrosion-resistant\nmetals, such as Inconel\u00ae 718, Inconel\u00ae X-750, Monel\u00ae K-500, and Ren\u00e9\u00ae 41.\n\nThe materials indicated above for fluid-carrying ducts have generally good prop-\nerties of ductility, and therefore deform plastically under stress around the tips of\ncracks. However, particular conditions of either load or temperature can cause a loss\nof ductility, in which case a material may fail. Therefore, the choice of a possible\nmaterial should take account of its fracture toughness and resistance to subcritical\nflaw growth, as has been shown in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.8.\n\nThe formability of a given material depends on its ductility, that is, on its aptitude to\nform rolls, bends, fittings, and corrugations for bellows. Under this aspect, corrosion-\nresistant steels and nickel-base alloys have proven to be the best materials for all\nformed elements of fluid-carrying ducts.\n\nThe weldability of a material is important, because welding is the most used\nmethod of joining permanently various elements of a line. In case of flexible hoses,\nbrazing is the most common method of connecting permanently the braid of a hose\nto each of the connecting points. Methods of welding elements of lines include\ntungsten-inert-gas (TIG) and electron beam, as has been shown in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.7.\n\nLubricants are sometimes used on the surfaces of bellows or other elements of\nlines. For this purpose, a corrosion-inhibiting type of molybdenum disulfide (MoS)\ncoating can be used for corrosion-resistant steels. Nickel-base alloys resist better\nthan steels to chemical attack. Plating or lubricants are also used on bolts and nuts to\nprevent thread galling. A thread lubricant used for the Saturn engine systems was a\nphosphoric-acid-bonded dry-film lubricant. Platings are used at temperatures higher\nthan 422 K [1].\n\n7.4 Coupling Components for Tubing\n\nThe components described here are devices which contain and control the flow\nof fluids in ducts. These devices can be classified into the following categories:\ndisconnects, couplings, fittings, fixed joints, and seals. A brief description is given\nbelow for each category.\n\nA disconnect is a type of separable connector consisting of two separable halves,\nan interface seal, and usually a latch-release locking mechanism.

These three types are sometimes used\nin combinations, the most common of them being fillet and sleeve (f).\n\nWhen possible, weld joints are located in areas free from vibrations. In particular,\nlocations in which vibrations are perpendicular to the tube axis are avoided. Tungsten\nInert Gas (TIG) Welding is the most widely used of the joining methods for fixed\njoints. Gas Metal Arc (GMA) Welding is also used to join heavy sections, when it\nis desirable to reduce the number of weld passes needed to complete a joint. These\nmethods have been described in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.7. Electron Beam (EB) Welding (a\nvacuum-based process in which a beam of high-velocity electrons is applied to the\ntwo metals to be joined) is applied in particular cases, for example, to join metals\nwhere a narrow weld bead or minimum heat input to the parts is necessary, or to join\nparts made of titanium alloys, which must be protected from oxygen.\n\nAccording to Howell and Weathers [2], brazing is a metal-joining operation\nperformed at temperatures ranging between those of welding and soft soldering,\nwhere soft soldering temperatures are considered to be below 723 K. Brazing differs\nfrom welding, because in the former: (1) bonding results from wetting rather than\nmelting the base alloy; (2) the brazing filler metal (brazing alloy) is made to flow\ninto the joint by capillary action to create the bond; and (3) the brazing filler metal is\nan alloy having a composition different from that of the metals to be joined. Brazing\nfiller metals used are often alloys of silver, aluminium, gold, copper, cobalt, or nickel.\n\nAccording to Kazakov [12], diffusion bonding is a process by which a joint can\nbe made between similar and dissimilar metals, alloys, and non-metals, through\n",

These transition joints were developed to provide a fixed joint between\ntitanium propellant tanks and stainless steel lines. Materials commonly diffusion\nbonded are Ti-5AI-2.5Sn or Ti-6A1-4 V alloys with 304L, 321, and 347 stainless\nsteel. All titanium alloy-to-stainless-steel combinations have been used successfully\n[11].\n\nSoldering is a metal-joining operation similar to brazing, but takes place with\nfillers (also known as solders) which melt at a temperature below 723 K.\n\nSoldered joints have been successful in low-pressure applications. They are light,\nrequire simple heating tools, can be assembled in a minimum envelope, do not need\ninert-gas shielding, and are readily made on in-place hardware [11].\n\nAn interference fit joint, also known as tight fit connector, is a fastening between\ntwo parts which uses the pressure exerted by one of the parts against the other to\nobtain the desired result. For this purpose, the inner diameter of enveloping part (also\nknown as the hole or the hub) is smaller than the outer diameter of enveloped part\n(also known as the shaft). Therefore, in order to fasten the two parts, it is necessary\nto apply force during assembly. After the parts are joined, the enveloped part exerts a\npressure against the enveloping part along the mating surface, with consequent elastic\ndeformation of the whole assembly. Interference fit joints without the use of some\nother joining method are not used in ducts for propellants, but are used sometimes in\nducts for pneumatic or hydraulic fluids [11]. The definitions of the joining methods\nindicated above (welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, etc.) are rather intuitive than\nrigorous, for the sake of clarity. Formal definitions of such methods can be found,\nfor example, in [13].\n\nConnecting flanges or glands for tubing used in aerospace vehicles should be\nrigid enough to maintain the integrity of static seals. Flanges should have the surface\nfinish, the radial clearances, and the rigidity required by the specific seal used. Flanges\nhaving insufficient rigidity or inadequately bolted are susceptible to rotation under\noperational loads.

For a given\nReynolds number, the pressure loss coefficient for an elbow decreases, reaches a\nminimum value, and then increases as the ratio R/D of the bend radius to the inside\ndiameter of the elbow increases.\n\nWhen the routing of a line requires elbows of small bend radii, the consequent\npressure losses can be reduced by either choosing the optimum value of the R/D ratio\nfor each elbow, or adding flow guide vanes to the elbows, as shown in the following\nfigure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].\n",

For the same purpose, the edges of a duct at each end should be rounded instead\nof sharp. In case of expanding conical ducts, the included angle of the cone frustum\nshould be less than or equal to 2/18 rad (10\u00b0).

For example, when the pumps of a rocket engine\nhave discharge ports placed oppositely, care must be taken in order to have equal\npressure losses at the two ports.

The structural\nresponse applies accelerations to the suction part of a propellant feed system. The\ntwo feed lines (for respectively the fuel and the oxidiser) respond separately to these\naccelerations, and cause pressure pulses at the inlet of the two pumps. As a result\nof these pressure pulses, the pumps and the discharge lines transmit a varying rate\nof propellant flow to the combustion chamber. The combustion chamber, in turn,\ngenerates a pulsating pressure and a pulsating thrust. Instability occurs when the\npulsating thrust is fed back to the structure, so as to reinforce the initial perturbation.\n\nThe following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1], illustrates the vibration\nsuppressing method used for the two pumps of the Titan II.\n",

    "694": "7.7 Bellows Joints 687\n7.7 Bellows Joints\n\nAccording to the definition given by Howell and Weathers [2], a bellows joint is an\nelastic, corrugated, tubular connector used for conducting a fluid between points of\nrelative angular, transverse, lateral, or combined motion.\n\nBellows joints are used where axial, lateral, angular, or combined deflections exist\nbetween interconnected components of lines. A bellows joint in a line consists of the\nfollowing parts:\n\ne a bellows, which is the flexible corrugated tube carrying the pressure exerted by\nthe fluid conducted in the line;\n\n\u00a2 restraints on the bellows, which prevent movements caused by internal pressure;\n\n\u00a2 means of attaching the bellows to the line; and\n\ne a flow liner for the bellows.\n\nA bellows joint in a duct can absorb deflections with much smaller reaction loads\nthan the loads in a hard line. A free bellows can absorb four types of motion applied\nto its ends: (a) axial motion due to tension or compression forces; (b) offset motion\nwith end planes parallel; (c) angular motion about its centre; and (d) torsional motion\nabout its axis.\n\nVarious restrains or linkages can be used in order for a bellows to absorb only\ncertain types of motion. For example, a gimbal ring linkage allows a bellows to\nabsorb only angular motion. An internal (left) and an external (right) mounting of\ngimbal rings for a bellows joint are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy\nof NASA [1].

When the\nstresses resulting from such vibrations exceed the fatigue limits of the material of\nwhich a bellows is made, then failure occurs.\n\nBellows are used for ducts of rocket engines in various sizes and operating condi-\ntions. A bellows operates usually in the plastic range of the material of which it\nis made. This is because the necessity of reducing weight implies small values of\nthickness for the bellows walls, provided that the magnitudes of the reactions at the\nbellows ends are acceptable. A formed bellows with straight corrugated sidewall is\nthe type most frequently used for rocket engines.\n\nThe types of pressures to be carried by a bellows in operating conditions are:\n\u00a9 normal operating pressure;\n\u00a9 surge pressure;\n\ne proof pressure; and\ne burst pressure.\n\nBy surge pressure we mean the variation of pressure which occurs in a line\nconducting fluid as a result of a change in the flow velocity. This variation of pressure\nmay occur in a line, for example, when a pump starts or stops, or a valve is opened or\nclosed rapidly, or the diameter of the line changes abruptly. When a valve is closed\nrapidly, the velocity head of the fluid moving forward in a line decreases whereas its\npressure head increases suddenly, due to the compression which occurs upstream of\nthe valve. By proof pressure we mean:\n\nproof pressure = (normal operating pressure + surge pressure) x safety factor\n\nAs has been shown in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.9, the safety factor is a multiplier, whose\nvalue (greater than unity) is chosen by the designer to take account of small variations\nof the properties of the material, of the quality of manufacturing, and of the magnitude\nand distribution of the load. Finally, by burst pressure we mean:\n\nburst pressure = proof pressure x safety factor\n\nThese pressures generate hoop (circumferential) stresses and bulging (meridian)\nstresses, which must be carried by the corrugated sidewall. A bellows must resist\ncolumn buckling under application of proof pressure. Under application of burst\npressure, a bellows is permitted to deform and take permanent set, but not to leak.\nThe limiting bulging stresses and allowable motion stresses (bending stresses) of\nmaterials frequently used for bellows are given in the following table, adapted from\n[1].\n",

Bellows have usually thin walls, in order to reduce weight.\nConsequently, the materials of which bellows are made operate under stresses near\nor in the plastic range, with resulting low fatigue lives.\n\nBellows are also subject to vibrations, caused by the fluids or by mechanical parts.\nThey must be designed so that no reduction in fatigue life is caused by vibration. In\norder to predict vibratory stresses, it is possible to use known vibration inputs relating\nto other engines in the same conditions, and compare such inputs with the frequencies\nof resonance of the given ducts, which can be calculated. Otherwise, it is possible to\nconstruct a prototype and test it on various engines, while the vibration environment\nis measured. When a bellows operates at excitation frequencies matching any of\nits natural frequencies of vibration, then its fatigue life can be exceeded in a short\ninterval of time.\n\nThe most frequent failure mode for a bellows is a fatigue crack, which gives rise to\nleakage through the corrugated wall. The cracks develop circumferentially in areas\nof maximum bending stress, which are the crowns and the roots of the corrugations.\n",

However, care must be taken,\nbecause internal flow liners, too, may be subject to flow-induced vibrations.\n\nBellows are also subject to vibrations induced by mechanical parts of engines.\nWhen the frequencies of the exciting vibrations are known, for example, through\nmeasurements, then bellows can be designed so that their natural frequencies should\nnot match the excitation frequencies.\n",
    "698": "7.7 Bellows Joints 691\n\nBellows may be subject to buckling due to excessive internal or external pressure.\nBuckling due to high internal pressure results in column instability, whereas buckling\ndue to high external pressure results in crushed corrugations. Buckling can occur only\nwhen the pressures in actual operating conditions are beyond the pressures predicted\nin the original requirements.\n\nA bellows may be subject to corrosion, depending on the material of which it is\nmade. A material commonly used for bellows is stainless steel 321 CRES, which\nis resistant but still susceptible to corrosion, because of its high percentage of iron.\nThis and other materials have been discussed in paragraph 3.\n\nThe principal difficulties in the manufacturing of bellows are material thinning,\nheat-treatment control, welding, and convolution stack-off.\n\nBellows are thinned at the corrugation crowns, about 5% or 10% below the\nnominal thickness of the wall. As a result of this thinning, higher deflection takes\nplace in the thinned section, because its stiffness is reduced, and consequently higher\nstresses and lower resistance to fatigue can occur.\n\nHeat treatment of bellows is controlled in order to avoid degraded performance\ncaused by improper treatment. In particular, this control requires the maintenance\nof the proper gaseous environment during heat treatment, to avoid oxidation and\nconsequent strength reduction.\n\nWelding problems are due to insufficient quality control. Such problems can be\navoided by inspecting radiographically all welds.\n\nConvolution stack-off is the eccentricity of convolutions or corrugations of the\nbellows with respect to each other. Since this eccentricity depends on the tools used\nin the process of fabrication, then all of the eccentricity is accumulated in the same\ndirection, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].\n\nSTACKOFF\n(ECCENTRICITY)\nOVERALL f \\\nLENGTH\nOUTSIDE DIAMETER\nCONVOLUTION STACKOFF\n",

This accumulation can be controlled by rotating the bellows after the\nforming of each convolution.\n\nIt is necessary to use handling-protection devices in the duct assembly and during\nprocessing, shipping, and installation of bellows. This is particularly important in\ncase of bellows having thin walls (less than or equal to 0.762 mm).\n\nIn order to protect the bellows joints incorporated in a duct from over-deflection,\nit is necessary to use strong-back fixtures which attach to the duct on either side\nof each bellows joint and form a protective bridge around it.

Other types of restraint are the hinged\njoint, the ball joint, and the braided wire sheath.\n\nThe gimbal-ring joint can be designed to withstand high pressures and temper-\natures. It can also withstand torsional loads and absorb angular deflections in all\nplanes. Excessive angular motion of the bellows can be prevented by means of stops,\nand the pivot pins which carry the loads can be designed for either single-shear\nor double-shear support. The same considerations apply to the hinged joint, which\nallows angular motion in only one plane.\n\nAnother type of external, tension-tie restraint is a braided wire sheath, as is the\ncase with a flexible hose. A joint of this type can absorb both angular and shear\ndeflections. It also acts as a vibration damper for the bellows. Friction between the\nbraid and the bellows can be reduced by using an adapter, which provides clearance\nat the end of the corrugations, and by applying a solid dry-film lubricant on the outer\nsurface of the bellows and on the inner surface of the braid.\n",

This bellows has each\nof its ends welded into a section of fluid ducting, in order to provide a continuous,\nleak-proof pathway. The bellows have several thin plies in a sandwich configuration,\ninstead of a single thick sheet of metal. This arrangement makes the bellows more\nflexible and maintains integrity against pressure.\n\nThe ducts which contain flexible joints internally tied have an internal diameter\nlarge enough to allow an internal support mounted on gimbals. This internal support\narrangement saves weight in comparison with an external support. Were it not for\nthe gimbal joint, which holds both ends of the flexible joint together, the internal\noperating pressure of the duct would expand the flexible bellows longitudinally like\nan accordion. The joint of the internal gimballed support is of the ball-and-socket\ntype. Ducts with small internal diameters use an internal gimbal ring to restrain the\nbellows. The ends of the flexible joint are attached to the gimbal ring (which is\ncentred over the bellows) at two points, so as to form a universal-type joint.\n\nThe flexible joints contain an integral flow liner. This liner prevents the propellant\nflowing through the duct from impinging on the corrugations of the bellows, which\ncould cause turbulence in the flow and vibrations in the materials. The liner is made\nup of two or three overlapping pieces. The outside ends of the end pieces are welded\ninto the flexible joint, so as to form a continuous, smooth internal diameter when the\nflexible joint is welded into a duct. The overlapping portions of the liner are shaped\nas a truncated ball and socket, to allow movement of the flexible joint. The liner\nallows propellant to fill the space between it and the bellows. Screened ports at the\nupstream ends of the flow liner provide a path for propellant to exit the space behind\nthe liner after engine shutdown [4].\n\nThe flexible joints used in the RS-25 engine are the internal tripod and the\nexternal-gimbal ring joints.

These failures have been attributed to vibrations\nof the cantilevered end of the sleeve. This problem has been solved by an increase in\nthe thickness of the wall, with a consequent increase in the rigidity of the liner [1].\n\nCollapse of liners has also occurred as a result of pressure on the outer diameter\nof the liner exceeding that of the inner diameter.

This is because little flexibility is required in lines of small engines,\nwhich are not mounted on gimbals and use storable propellants.\n\nThe J-2 and F-1 engines (both of which have been used in the Saturn V launch\nvehicle) have many fluid-carrying lines between the engine and the vehicle.

Some exceptions to this rule are cited below.\n\nThe type most frequently used is the metallic, annularly convoluted inner core. The\nmetallic, helically convoluted inner core type is not used in aerospace applications.\nRolled and welded tubes or seamless tubes are used, but those of the seamless type\nare much more expensive. The welds of those of the rolled and welded type require\nX-ray and leakage verifications before use.\n\nThe engines of the Titan III have used successfully inner cores of both normal and\ncarbon-impregnated Teflon\u00ae (poly-tetrafluoroethylene) in sizes ranging from 9.525\n",

Rubber has been used only for applications\ninvolving non-cryogenic or non-high temperatures. In addition, the quality of rubber\nis subject to deterioration with time.\n\nBending moments to flexible hoses are to be considered, because the components\nadjacent to a hose are loaded. Low values of bending moments are desirable, because\nlow bending moments applied to flexible hoses which cross the gimbal plane result\nin low loads applied to the actuators which gimbal the engines. Bending moments\ncan be reduced by using lubricants applied to braid wires and to the other surfaces\nof the inner core. An inner core may be compressed axially before installing the\nbraid. This results in a higher number of convolutions per unit length and in a lower\nbending stiffness, but also in greater weight and cost of the materials. A compressed\ninner core also improves the ability of a flexible hose to withstand pressure impulses.\n\nBuckling stability is not a concern in the design of flexible hoses. This is because\nthe support provided by the braid for the inner core prevents buckling.\n\nThe braid of a flexible hose is a woven tubular cover, which restrains the inner\ncore against elongation and gives it lateral support and protection. The braid absorbs\nthe entire separating load of a flexible hose. In rocket engines, the braid is woven of\nwire made of stainless steel.\n\nTubular braid may be woven directly on the inner core of flexible hoses. Sections\nof braid are cut at a length slightly greater than the length of the convoluted inner\ncore. A tensile load is applied to the ends of the braid section, and the section is\nattached to end fittings by brazing or welding [1].\n\nThe pattern of a braid weave must be such as to prevent the wires from binding or\nbottoming out, within the design limits of angular deflection for a particular section\nof flexible hose.\n\nTypical configurations of braids used for flexible hoses are shown in the following\nfigure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].\n",

Downstream of filters, the size of the remaining solid particles is reduced\nto such an extent as not to affect the performance of components sensitive to contam-\ninants. Examples of such components are valves and actuators. According to Buck-\ningham and Winzel [16], contaminating particles existing in fluid-carrying ducts of\nrocket engines are due to three principal causes, which are:\ne residual manufacturing debris in the tanks and in other parts of a fluid system;\n\u00a9 contaminating particles in the on-loaded fluids; and\n\u00a9 particles generated by the wear of components in normal operation.\nGenerally speaking, as has been shown by Howell and Weathers [2], there are two\ntechniques of filtration, which are briefly described below.\nOne of them, called surface filtration, is accomplished by impingement and reten-\ntion of solid particles on a matrix of pores placed in a single planar or curved surface.\nFiltration occurs only at that surface, and the particles which are not stopped there\n",
    "718": "7.9 Filters 711\npass through the filtering medium with no further change in direction. This technique\nof filtration is effective in collecting particles larger than the sizes of the pores, but\nnot effective in collecting fibres and particles smaller than the sizes of the pores.\nIts capability of retaining solid particles is limited by the area of the surface which\ncan be provided within a given envelope. Examples of surface filtration media are\nsingle-layer mesh screens, stacked washers, wound metallic ribbons, and sheets of\nperforated metals.\n\nThe other technique, called depth filtration, is accomplished by impingement and\nretention of solid particles in a matrix of pores placed in depth. Sand is a typical\nexample of a depth filtering medium, in which the filtering action consists of absorp-\ntion and entrapment of solid particles at random. Solid particles are retained not only\nat the surface, but also throughout the thickness of the filtering medium. The particles\nwhich pass through a matrix of pores are forced to change direction in a tortuous\npath. Depth filters are effective in collecting solid particles larger than the maximum\nsize of the pores and fibres. They can also collect a portion of solid particles smaller\nthan the largest size of the pores, depending on the type and on the thickness of\nthe filtering medium. Their capability per unit area of retaining solid particles is\nlarge, because the particles are retained not only on the surface but also throughout\nthe depth of the filtering medium. Examples of depth filtration media are multiple\nlayers of mesh, wounded wire cylinders, stacked discs of paper, sintered granulated\nmaterials, multiple layers of cloth, compressed or matted organic or inorganic fibres,\nstacked discs of etched metallic sheet, materials of elastic foam with open pores, and\nstacked membranes [2].\n\nIn the particular case of filters used in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines, most\nsurface filters are made of woven wire cloth, and most depth filters are made of\nstacked etched metallic discs.\n\nIna filter made of woven wire cloth, the filtering medium is woven from strands of\nmetal. A type of wave is plain square wave, in which the strands pass over and under\neach other in alternating sequence. Another type is twilled square wave, in which the\nstrands pass \u201cover two, under two\u201d in a staggered pattern. In both cases, the resultant\nopenings are square-shaped [16]. Woven wire cloth, also known as woven wire mesh,\nis woven on looms, by using a process similar to that used to weave clothing. The\nmesh uses one or another of various crimping pattern for the interlocking segments.\nSquare mesh, described above, is the most common type of mesh. The plain weave\nis the most common weave for woven wire cloth with a square opening in the plain\nweave. Materials used are austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. This type of filter is\nsuitable for non-critical hydraulic, pneumatic, and propellant feed applications [2].\nThe following figure, adapted from [16], shows a wire cloth pleated conical filter.\n",

The\nin-line filter case is the least accessible type of filter. It requires the removal of the\ncase from the piping system before a filter element can be removed. The T-type, also\nknown as pot type, is designed so that the filter element can be removed by removing\nthe filter pot. The Y-type is designed so that the filter element can be removed through\none leg of the Y, by removing a blank flange or a cover plate.\n\nThe seal used for a filter is particularly important in case of mechanical vibra-\ntions. In critical propellant feed applications, internal seals should be avoided when-\never possible, due to compatibility of materials and generation of particles during\nassembly.\n\nSuch devices as supporting cages, bolts, nuts, and O-rings are used to seal the\nfilter element at its interface with the case. The seals or the locking devices used in\nfilters are designed so as to avoid damages due to parts of filters which may migrate\ndownstream.\n\nSome filters have a pressure indicator which senses abnormal high differences in\npressure across a filter element. This device may sometimes indicate a high difference\nin pressure where a liquid and a gas flow intermittently. This may happen in ducts\ncarrying cryogenic fluids.\n\nSome filters used in lubrication and hydraulic ducts have a built-in by-pass valve,\nwhich opens and by-passes the filter when the difference in pressure across it exceeds\na given value. This device is incorporated in the filter, because it is better in some\ncases to keep a fluid-carrying duct working with a contaminated fluid than to have\na complete failure due to lack of fluid when the filter becomes plugged. This device\nis rarely used in rocket engines which operate for a very brief period of time, and\ntherefore the level of contamination in these filters cannot grow appreciably during\ntheir operating time.\n\nA filter can be cleaned in one or more of the following manners:\n",
    "723": "716 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures\ne back-flushing;\n\ne ultrasonic cleaning;\n\ne flushing;\n\n\u00a9 purging; and\n\ne initial cleaning.\n\nA brief description of these methods is given below.\n\nBack-flushing results from reversing the direction of flow through a filtering\nelement, with consequent flushing of solid particles from the inlet side of the filter.\nThis method removes loose particles, but not those which are tightly fixed within\nthe porous medium. Therefore, back-flushing must be followed by other methods to\nrestore a filter element to its original conditions of cleanliness.\n\nUltrasonic cleanliness consists in immersing a filter element in a tank containing\na solvent solution, and applying ultrasonic waves to this solution by means of trans-\nducers mounted on or within the tank. The ultrasonic waves produce cavitation on\nthe surface of the filter element immersed in the solution, and this in turn loosens\nsolid particles on the filter element.\n\nFlushing a filter element in the normal direction of flow, after applying back-\nflushing or ultrasonic cleaning, removes the solid particles which have previously\nbeen loosened and improves the degree of cleanliness.\n\nPurging consists in using a pre-filtered dry gas, such as air or nitrogen, which\npasses through a filter element to dry it and to also remove residual solvent which\nmay be left by previous cleaning processes. Purging a filter element is often less\neffective than ultrasonic cleaning and back-flushing.\n\nInitial cleaning of a new filter element is necessary, because solid particles may\nhave been introduced during manufacture and assembly of the filter into the filter\nelement and also into the filter case.\n\nUltrasonic cleaning, flushing, and back-flushing may be combined together to\nreach a desired level of cleanliness in a filter element.\n\nCloth elements made of stainless steel can reach a higher degree of initial clean-\nliness by applying acid passivation after assembly, or by annealing the assembly in\nan environment of hydrogen [2].\n\nThe choice of a particular type of filter to be used for a specific application depends\non:\n\ne largest size of solid particles which can be tolerated by the components of a\nfluid-carrying duct;\n\ne amount and type of solid particles which may be contained in a fluid during the\nservice life of a given rocket engine;\n\n\u00a9 maximum loss of pressure due to the presence of a given filter; and\n\ne space available within a fluid-carrying duct.\n",
    "724": "7.9 Filters 717\n\nThe maximum allowable size of solid particles in a given component (for example,\na valve or a servo-actuator) can be determined by evaluating the clearances or the\nsizes of narrow passages in the given component which are sensitive to contaminants.\nFor this purpose, it is necessary to determine the possible malfunctions of the given\ncomponent caused by the entrapment of solid particles carried by the fluid.\n\nThe amount and the type of solid particles during service life is difficult to deter-\nmine, because of uncertainties in the prediction of: (a) amount of solid particles\nwhich remain after cleaning a given component and its filter; (b) amount of solid\nparticles which are carried by the fluid; and (c) fluids and temperatures in operational\nconditions, which may differ from those of the tests conducted in laboratories.\n\nThe maximum loss of pressure due to a given filter and the space available within\nthe given duct can result from a system analysis and a trade-off study to determine\nwhether it is more advantageous to install a filter mounted externally to the component\nto be protected or a filter forming an integral part of the component itself.\n\nThe largest size of solid particles which can be transmitted through a filter is\nexpressed by a parameter known as filter rating. This parameter measures the degree\nof protection which a filter provides for downstream components.\n\nSeveral types of filter rating are specified by filters manufacturers.\n\nOne of them is the maximum particle size rating (MPR), which is the longest\ndimension, in microns, of any solid particle allowed downstream of a filter.\n\nAnother type of filter rating is the absolute rating, also known as glass bead rating\n(GBR), which is the size, in microns, of the largest hard spherical particle (i.e., glass\nbead) which would be removed by the filter under steady flow conditions [16]. In\nother words, the definition of absolute filter rating considers all solid particles to have\nspherical shape, and requires a filter to retain all solid particles whose diameter is\ngreater than or equal to a specified value. Therefore, the absolute rating takes account\nonly of the second largest dimension of any solid particle which can be transmitted\nthrough a filter.\n\nStill another type of filter rating is the nominal rating, which assesses the ability\nof a filter to remove a specified percentage (in either count or weight) of spherical\nsolid particles or graded dust whose size is equal to or greater than the value defined\nby its absolute rating. Therefore, the nominal rating of a given filter is always less\nthan its absolute rating.\n\nThe maximum particle size rating can be determined by test. The test is conducted\nby using a readily identifiable contaminant with particles of various sizes and shapes.\nA procedure for determining the maximum particle size rating is described in [16].\n\nThe absolute rating of a filter also can be determined by test. A test is conducted\nby filtration of an artificial contaminant (glass beads) under specified conditions, as\ndescribed in [19].\n\nThe nominal average rating of a filter can be determined by means of a mercury\nintrusion test, which is described in [20].\n",
    "725": "718 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures\n\nMaximum particle size tests are not practical for acceptance testing of production\nfilters. The glass bead test is a destructive type of test, and therefore is never used as\nan acceptance test. However, correlation of a glass bead test with a non-destructive\nbubble-point test permits verification of absolute rating for production filters [1]. The\nbubble-point test is based on the fact that, for a given liquid and for a given size of\npores with a constant wetting, the pressure necessary to force a bubble of air through a\npore is inversely proportional to the diameter of the pore. In other words, the diameter\nof the largest pore in a filter can be measured by wetting the filter element with a\nliquid and then measuring the pressure at which the first stream of bubbles is emitted\nfrom the upper surface of the filter element, when air is introduced to the open end.\nThe pressure at which the first stream of bubbles emerges is taken as a measure of\nthe diameter of the largest pore. The value of the constant of inverse proportionality\nbetween pressure and diameter is determined experimentally. Further information\non the bubble-point test can be found, fir example, in [16, 21]. The bubble-point test\nis covered by the standards ISO 4003:1977 [22] and ARP 901A [23].\n\nAs has been shown above, a filter is necessary to reduce the size of solid particles\ncarried in suspension by an operating fluid to a level which cannot cause damage\nto critical components of a duct. The determination of the filter area required for\nthis purpose is based on an accurate prediction of the amount of contaminant which\ncan be expected for any given application. The problem of accurately predicting the\nactual degree of contamination is still open. So far, there appears to be no correlation\nbetween the actual and the predicted amounts, sizes, and types of contamination [1].\nThe reason of this may be the variation in techniques used in manufacturing and\nbuilding components and assemblies.\n\nIn this state of things, for the purpose of demonstrating that a filter of sufficient\narea has been provided for a given application, a specified amount of contaminant\nis required to be retained by the filter, without exceeding some maximum difference\nof pressure between its inlet and outlet. The contaminants most frequently used are\nAC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts. These test dusts are Natural Arizona Dusts supplied\nby General Motors Phoenix Laboratory and classified to specific particle-size distri-\nbutions by the AC Spark Plug Division of General Motors Corporation [1]. Further\ninformation on AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts can be found in [24]. The two dusts\nnamed above provide a baseline material for evaluating the ability of a filter to retain\nparticles on its upstream side under flow conditions. Buckingham and Winzen [16]\ngives further information on tests which were conducted to determine the tolerance\nof various filter materials to contaminants for both gaseous and liquid flow.\n\nResidual contaminants, that is, contaminants remaining in a filter after cleaning,\nmay slough off and pass downstream of the filter. As has been shown above, such\ncontaminants may accumulate in a filter during its manufacturing process, or be\nintroduced there by the operating fluid, or be generated by the wear of mechanical\ncomponents.\n",
    "726": "7.9 Filters 719\n\nA cleaning of a filter removes a part of contaminants from the filter, the amount\nof this part depending on the accuracy of the cleaning process. Since this process\nis expensive, sometimes more expensive than the manufacturing process, then it is\ndesirable to reduce the amount of contaminants which accumulate during fabrication,\nassembly, and testing.\n\nIt is also desirable to reduce media migration, that is, the presence in the operating\nfluid of contaminants coming from either the filter element or the filter-supporting\nstructure. Filter materials subject to media migration are sintered porous metals,\npressed paper, matted fibres, glass fibres, sintered plastic, fired porcelain, bonded\ncarbon, and bonded stone [1, 2].\n\nOne of the most common tests for media migration combines thermal shock with\nvibration. In this test, a filter is exposed to its highest service temperature for a\nperiod of time and then to its lowest service temperature for an equal period. This\nprocedure is repeated several times. After this thermal shock, the filter is caused\nto vibrate at frequencies of service for a given period of time. After testing, the\nfilter is flushed with a given amount of fluid (usually 500 ml of either Freon TF or\nsome ozone-friendly substitute for it), and the fluid is collected and passed through a\n0.45 membrane pad. The membrane pad is then analysed for particles identifiable\nas material coming from either the filter element or the filter-supporting structure.\nWhen all of the particles are non-metallic and the filter is made entirely of metal,\nthen no media migration has occurred. When some of the particles are metallic,\nthen further analysis is required, and the filter material must be distinguished from\nresidual contaminants [1]. Individual particles taken from a representative sample of\nthe pad can be identified by microscopic examination.\n\nThe problem of determining the loss of pressure Ap through a filter as a function\nof its volumetric flow rate qg is difficult to solve. In case of a filter element of the\nsurface type, the pressure loss across the filter medium for either fine or coarse mesh\nis small in comparison with the pressure loss at filter entrance or exit.\n\nIn practice, the problem indicated above can be solved by tests which make it\npossible to plot curves of pressure loss against volumetric flow rate.\n\nOne of the formulae which can be used for determining the properties of a filter\nis known as the Kozeny-Carman equation [25], which is briefly discussed below.\n\nThe Kozeny-Carman equation expresses the pressure loss Ap (N/m\u00b0) of a fluid\nwhich passes through a porous material, such as a packed bed of solids. This equation,\nwhich holds only in case of laminar flow (Re < 1), can be expressed as follows\n\nAp 1804 (1 \u2014 \u00ab)? 180u (1 \u2014\u00a2\u20ac)? q\n\nL @b 8 \u201c~ @D2 6 A\nwhere L (m) is the total height of the bed, jz (kg m~! s~!) is the coefficient of\ndynamic viscosity of the fluid, @, is the sphericity (see below) of the particles in\nthe packed bed, D, (m) is the diameter of the volume equivalent spherical particle,\n\u00e9 is the porosity (the fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume) of the\nbed, jx (m/s) is the mean velocity of the fluid at right angles to the layers of the bed,\n",

The minus sign in front of the right-hand side\nof the preceding equation takes account of the loss of pressure with increasing mean\nvelocity or volumetric flow rate.\n\nBy sphericity \u00a2, of a particle in a packed bed we mean the ratio of the surface\narea of a sphere having the same volume V,, as the given particle to the surface area\nA, of the particle, as follows\n\n1*(6Vp)\u2019\nos A,\n\nAccording to this definition, the sphericity of a spherical particle is unity, and the\nsphericity of any non-spherical particle is less than unity.\n\nA derivation of the Kozeny-Carman equation and worked examples for its\napplication can be found in [26].\n\nOther equations (Darcy-Weisbach and Hagen-Poiseuille) found experimentally\nto determine the loss of pressure through a filter as a function of its volumetric flow\nrate are discussed in [16]. The equations cited above provide an excellent means for\nevaluating filter area requirements. However, they do not consider pressure losses at\nentrance and exit [1].\n\nFilters are not tested for acceptance with the same fluids as the propellants used\nby rocket engines, because of difficulties due to testing with cryogenic or toxic\nor corrosive propellants.

Other types of flange joints have\n\nbeen illustrated in Sect. 7.4. Methods of calculation for such types of joints are\n\ndescribed, for example, in [28, 29].\n\n711 Gaskets and Other Seals for Flange Joints\n\nGaskets are used as static seals. The following types of gaskets are generally used\n\nfor flange joints:\n\ne annular-ring gaskets;\n\ne pressure-actuated gaskets; and\n\ne full-face gaskets.\n\nGaskets of the annular-ring type are the most widely used for bolted flanges.\nPressure-actuated gaskets use the internal pressure of the fluid as an aid to the sealing\naction. Full-face gaskets generally require higher bolt loads than is the case with\nannular-ring gaskets. Full-face gaskets are scarcely tolerant to thermal gradients, and\nhave a tendency to concentrate the loads at the bolt holes and at the portion of the\ngasket outside the bolt circle. These gaskets are largely used for non-critical service\nconditions, but rarely used for service conditions involving either high (above 505 K)\nor cryogenic (below 122 K) temperatures, or relative pressures above 2.068 MPa [2].\n\nA gasket used for a flange joint should be thick enough to provide adequate\nconformity to the surfaces of the metallic parts of the joint, because thicker gaskets are\ngenerally better suited to conform to surface scratches and to compensate for sealing\nwaviness. However, the same gasket should be thin enough to provide stability to the\njoint and to prevent blow-out when residual stresses are low and internal pressures\nare high [2].\n\nGaskets of a common type have O-rings made of elastomeric materials, which\nare natural or synthetic rubbers. They are used over a temperature range going from\n211 to 505 K for long periods of time, and at higher temperatures for shorter periods\nof time [11]. At low temperatures, the elastomeric O-ring is installed between thin\nfoil films, or is coated with indium, which remains ductile at such temperatures, as\nshown in the following figure, re-drawn from [2].\n\nFOIL 6 oe ELASTOMERIC\nOR O-RING\nFILM \u2014\u2014\n",

The pressure on the flange ring in service causes the elastomer to\nconform completely to the flange at the leak path.\n\nElastomeric O-ring gaskets can be used over a wide range of pressures and are high\nreliable when installed properly. Incorrect installation can cause damage or improper\nsqueeze or extrusion to the elastomer, with consequent leakage. The squeeze required\nto prevent damage while at the same time preventing leakage due to insufficient\npressure ranges from 8 to 32%. O-ring extrusion and consequent nibbling of the\nelastomer occur when the clearance between the retaining members permits the\nelastomer to be forced into the clearance. When the elastomer becomes trapped, it\nis nibbled or sheared off when the pressure decays. Extrusion can be prevented by\ncombining properly clearances and hard elastomers [11].\n\nElastomeric materials for flanges can also be used in moulded-in-place seals,\nwhich are flat plates having elastomeric inserts moulded into machined grooves, as\nshown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11].\n\nBOLT HOLES\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n= aoe\n\u2014>& SEAL\nWEB\nRETAINING PLATE\n\nIn these devices, the initial sealing action is due to the compression of the elas-\ntomer, and the subsequent sealing action is due to the pressure in service, which\nforces the elastomer against the flange at the leak path.\n\nA moulded-in-place seal has the following advantages over a conventional O-ring:\ne the thickness of the metal plate controls the amount of squeeze on the elastomeric\n\nportion of the seal, thereby permitting the use of flat-faced flanges on both sides\n\nof the seal, and making it unnecessary to machine an O-ring groove in one of the\nflanges; and\n\n\u00a9 itis easier to install in large and cumbersome hardware, because it can be installed\nlaterally between two flanges.\n",

Metallic\nO-ring perform satisfactorily in these conditions and offer the advantage of small\ncross sections where space is limited.

Spiral-wound gaskets are still used today where leakage is tolerable, which\nhappens in isolate engine locations and in large diameters, where they have a cost\nadvantage over more sophisticated machined seals.\n\nPressure-actuated seals were originally developed for cryogenic temperatures.\nLater on, they were modified for hot gases.

The cross section of a pressure-actuated\nseal expands due to the internal pressure exerted by the fluid carried in the duct,\nand this expansion generates the seal.

The dimensions of the cross-section of the seal are usually much\nsmaller than the inside radius of the seal, and the legs of the seal are much more\nflexible than the web [28]. The cross section of a pressure-actuated seal may also be\nC-shaped (open O-ring) instead of U-shaped.\n\nAccording to [28], pressure-actuated seals have the following advantages over\nelastomeric or metallic O-rings:\n",
