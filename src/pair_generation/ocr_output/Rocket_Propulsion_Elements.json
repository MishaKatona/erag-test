    "14": "PREFACE\n\nThis eighth edition follows earlier editions and focuses on the subject of rocket\npropulsion, its fundamentals, its essential technologies, and its key design ratio-\nnale. It describes the various types of rocket propulsion systems, physical phe-\nnomena, and essential relationships. It aims to balance a rigorous introduction of\nfundamentals with tables, figures, and recent information that can be of interest\nto practitioners. It endeavors to provide a clearer explanation of the basic physics\nand chemistry of rocket propulsion and some of its design approaches.\n\nSeveral chapters are devoted exclusively to liquid propellant rocket engines\nand also to solid propellant rocket motors (almost half the book), the two most\nprevalent of the rocket propulsion systems. It also has one chapter each on hybrid\npropulsion (with one liquid and one solid propellant) and on electrical propul-\nsion (with several different types). The principal flight applications for these\nfour major types of rocket propulsion systems are described. Brief discussions\nof nuclear thermal propulsion systems and solar thermal propulsion system are\nincluded. Our book does not contain speculative future propulsion schemes such\nas nuclear fusion propulsion or pulsed detonations of propellant charges, because\nthese are as yet not considered to be practical.\n\nThe first few chapters of the book concern basic subjects. Following an intro-\nduction are definitions of the key propulsion parameters, principal thermodynamic\nrelations, nozzle theory, vehicle flight analyses (flying inside and outside the\nearth\u2019s atmosphere), or thermochemical analyses of combustion gas properties.\nThe last few chapters relate intimately to rocket propulsion systems, namely thrust\nvector control, selection of propulsion systems for specific missions, exhaust\nplumes, and the testing of rocket propulsion systems.\n\nThe book has been used for six decades in undergraduate and graduate courses\nof rocket propulsion in many universities, both in the United States and in other\n\nxiii\n",

In this eighth edition many examples and problems have been revised\nor added for a better discussion of the principles involved and the technical issues\nused in preliminary design. More than 20 new homework problems have been\nadded (and several others were deleted) for more relevance of the text material\nand for more practice of the key equations. Some of the problems have printed\nanswers, so students can self-check their solutions. Many of the problems are\npatterned after the analyses and engineering efforts of actual propulsion systems.\nA solutions manual is available to selected users. Most of the book may be\ncovered in a one- or two-semester course depending on the students\u2019 background.\n\nSince the first edition in 1949 it has been a most popular technical rocket\npropulsion book and has been used by at least 75,000 students and professionals\nin approximately 37 countries. According to a committee of the American Insti-\ntute of Aeronautics and Astronautics it is the longest living aerospace book ever,\nin print continuously for 60 years. It is the only aerospace book cited in two\nprestigious book awards of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronau-\ntics. Earlier editions have been translated into Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.\nThe authors have given guest lectures on rocket propulsion subjects at several\nuniversities and a three-day course based on this book.\n\nA number of new items and a few extensively changed sections appear in this\nnew eighth edition. For example, this is the first edition with a separate chapter\non turbopumps, an essential component of medium and large liquid propellant\nrocket engines. It has new or extensively revised discussions on tank pressur-\nization, a new class of solid propellants that have been put into production, the\nfirst high-thrust large hybrid propulsion system that has flown in an experimental\nmanned craft with nitrous oxide as the oxidizer and a rubbery fuel, a concept\nfor integrated computer programs for modern rocket propulsion engines, health\nmonitoring controls able to save hardware, and new flight applications for elec-\ntrical propulsion systems. Almost all libraries of rocket propulsion organizations\nseem to have at least two editions of this book. The new edition has about three\ndozen new and different figures, a dozen revised or new tables, and many other\nclarifications, deletions, changes, or minor additions.\n\nIt is usually easier, faster, and less expensive to uprate or modify an existing\nproven propulsion system for a new application than to design and build a truly\nnew one. For example, in the liquid propellant engine field with turbopump feed\nsystems, it has been more common in the last few decades to increase the thrust or\nperformance by modifying an existing engine than to undertake the development\nof a brand new engine. A revised discussion of engine families (with related\nengine designs) and a new table of 13 different models of the RL 10 upper-stage\nengine emphasized this point.\n\nAlthough the United States is officially committed to convert from the English\nEngineering (EE) system of units (foot, pound) to the SI or metric system of units\n(m, kg), this has not as yet happened. The major portion of the U.S. propulsion\nindustry for chemical rockets has been and is currently still using EE units for\ndesign and manufacturing. If a particular customer wants SI units, they will be\ngiven engineering information in SI units, but the fabrication will most likely\n",
    "16": "PREFACE XV\nstill be done in EE units. Many colleges and research organizations in the United\nStates and most propulsion organizations in the other countries use the SI system\nof units. So this book uses both systems; the examples and problems use one or\nthe other and some tables have both sets of units.\n\nComputers have changed the way we do business in many fields. In rocket\npropulsion computer programs have been developed for many engineering anal-\nyses, computer-aided designs, computer-aided manufacturing, business and engi-\nneering transactions, test data collection, data analysis, data presentation, project\nmanagement, and many others. In fact computers are used extensively in some\ncompanies to design new propulsion systems. Therefore we identify in this book\nthe places where computer programs will be helpful and we mentions this often.\nHowever, we do not discuss specific computer programs because they take up too\nmuch space, become obsolete in a short time without regular upgrading, some\ndo not have a way to provide help to a user, and some of the better programs\nare company proprietary and thus not publicly available.\n\nPropellants are hazardous materials. The authors and the publisher recom-\nmend that readers of this book do not work with them or handle them without\nexhaustive study of the hazards, the behavior, and properties of each propellant,\nand rigorous safety training including becoming familiar with protective equip-\nment. Safety training and propellant information is given routinely to employees\nof organizations in this business. Neither the authors nor the publisher assume\nany responsibility for actions on rocket propulsion taken by the readers, either\ndirectly or indirectly. The information presented in this book is insufficient and\ninadequate for conducting rocket propulsion experiments or operations.\n\nThe authors acknowledge gratefully the data, suggestions, and assistance given\nto them while preparing the manuscript for this book. Fortunately we have had\nthe help from a number of outstanding experts in the field, reviewers, and edi-\ntors. We appreciate the reviews of solid propellant motors by David McGrath\nof ATK Launch Systems, Inc., and reviews of several chapters and the supply\nof certain propellant data by Eckart W.

    "18": "CHAPTER 1\nSS\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nThe word propulsion comes from the Latin propulsus, which is the past participle\nof the verb propellere, meaning to drive away. In a broad sense propulsion is the\nact of changing the motion of a body. Propulsion mechanisms provide a force\nthat moves bodies that are initially at rest, changes a velocity, or overcomes\nretarding forces when a body is propelled through a medium. Jet propulsion is\na means of locomotion whereby a reaction force is imparted to a device by the\nmomentum of ejected matter.\n\nRocket propulsion is a class of jet propulsion that produces thrust by ejecting\nmatter stored in a flying vehicle called the propellant. Duct propulsion is a class\nof jet propulsion and includes turbojets and ramjets; these engines are also com-\nmonly called air-breathing engines. Duct propulsion devices utilize mostly the\nsurrounding medium as the \u201cworking fluid,\u201d together with some vehicle-stored\nfuel. Combinations of rockets and duct propulsion devices can be attractive for\nsome narrow applications and one is briefly described in this chapter.\n\nThe energy source most useful to rocket propulsion is chemical combustion.\nEnergy can also be supplied by solar radiation and, in the past, also by nuclear\nreaction. Accordingly, the various propulsion devices can be divided into chem-\nical propulsion, nuclear propulsion, and solar propulsion. Table 1-1 lists many\nof the important propulsion concepts according to their energy source and type\nof propellant or working fluid. Radiation energy can originate from sources other\nthan the sun and theoretically can cover the transmission of energy by microwave\nand laser beams, electromagnetic waves, and electrons, protons, and other par-\nticle beams from a transmitter to a flying receiver. Nuclear energy is associated\nwith the transformations of atomic particles within the nucleus of atoms and\nusually is created by fission or fusion. Other energy sources, both internal (in the\nvehicle) and external, can be considered. The energy form found in the output\n\n1\n",

The ejected mass can\nbe in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state. Often a combination of two or more of\nthese is ejected. At very high temperatures it can also be a plasma, which is an\nelectrically activated gas.\n1.1. DUCT JET PROPULSION\nThis class, also called air-breathing engines, comprises devices which have a duct\nto confine the flow of air. They use oxygen from the air to burn fuel stored in\nthe flight vehicle. The class includes turbojets, turbofans, ramjets, and pulsejets.\nThis class of propulsion is mentioned primarily to provide a comparison with\nrocket propulsion and a background for combination rocket\u2014duct engines, which\nare mentioned later. Table 1-2 compares several performance characteristics\nof specific chemical rockets with those of typical turbojets and ramjets. A high\nspecific impulse, which is a measure of performance to be defined later, is directly\nrelated to a long flight range and thus indicates the superior range capability of air\nbreather engines over chemical rockets at relatively low altitude. The uniqueness\nof the rocket, for example, high thrust to weight, high thrust to frontal area, and\nnearly thrust independence of altitude, enables extremely long flight ranges to be\nobtained in rarefied air and in space.\n\nThe turbojet engine is the most common of ducted engines. Figure 1-1 shows\nthe basic elements.\n",

Figure 1\u20142 shows the basic components of one type of ramjet. Ramjets\nwith subsonic combustion and hydrocarbon fuel have an upper speed limit of\napproximately Mach 5; hydrogen fuel, with hydrogen cooling, raises this to at\nleast Mach 16.

ROCKET PROPULSION\nRocket propulsion systems can be classified according to the type of energy\nsource (chemical, nuclear, or solar), the basic function (booster stage, sustainer\nor upper stages, attitude control, orbit station keeping, etc.), the type of vehicle\n(aircraft, missile, assisted takeoff, space vehicle, etc.), size, type of propellant,\ntype of construction, or number of rocket propulsion units used in a given vehicle.\nAnother way is to classify by the method of producing thrust. A thermody-\nnamic expansion of a gas is used in the majority of practical rocket propulsion\nconcepts. The internal energy of the gas is converted into the kinetic energy of\nthe exhaust flow and the thrust is produced by the gas pressure on the surfaces\nexposed to the gas, as will be explained later. This same thermodynamic the-\nory and the same generic equipment (nozzle) is used for jet propulsion, rocket\npropulsion, nuclear propulsion, laser propulsion, solar-thermal propulsion, and\nsome types of electrical propulsion. Totally different methods of producing thrust\n",

As described below, these electric systems use magnetic and/or electric\nfields to accelerate electrically charged molecules or atoms at very low densities.\nIt is also possible to obtain a very small acceleration by taking advantage of the\ndifference in gravitational attraction as a function of altitude, but this method is\nnot explained in this book.\n\nThe Chinese developed and used solid propellant in rocket missiles over 800\nyears ago, and military bombardment rockets were used frequently in the eigh-\nteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, the significant developments of rocket\npropulsion took place in the twentieth century. Early pioneers included the Rus-\nsian Konstantin E. Ziolkowsky, who is credited with the fundamental rocket\nflight equation and his 1903 proposals to build rocket vehicles. The German\nHermann Oberth developed a more detailed mathematical theory; he proposed\nmultistage vehicles for space flight and fuel-cooled thrust chambers. The Amer-\nican Robert H. Goddard is credited with the first flight using a liquid propellant\nrocket engine in 1926. An early book on the subject was written by the Viennese\nengineer Eugen Sanger. For rocket history see Refs. 1-1 to 1-8.\n\nChemical Rocket Propulsion\n\nThe energy from a high-pressure combustion reaction of propellant chemicals,\nusually a fuel and an oxidizing chemical, permits the heating of reaction product\ngases to very high temperatures (2500 to 4100\u00b0C or 4500 to 7400\u00b0F). These\ngases subsequently are expanded in a nozzle and accelerated to high velocities\n(1800 to 4300 m/sec or 5900 to 14,100 ft/sec). Since these gas temperatures are\nabout twice the melting point of steel, it is necessary to cool or insulate all the\nsurfaces that are exposed to the hot gases. According to the physical state of\nthe propellant, there are several different classes of chemical rocket propulsion\ndevices.\n\nLiquid propellant rocket engines use liquid propellants that are fed under pres-\n\nsure from tanks into a thrust chamber.* A typical pressure-fed liquid propellant\nrocket engine system is schematically shown in Fig. 1-3. The liquid bipropellant\nconsists of a liquid oxidizer (e.g., liquid oxygen) and a liquid fuel (e.g., kerosene).\nA monopropellant is a single liquid that contains both oxidizing and fuel species;\nit decomposes into hot gas when properly catalyzed. A large turbopump-fed liq-\nuid propellant rocket engine is shown in Fig. 1\u20144. Gas pressure feed systems are\nused mostly on low thrust, low total energy propulsion systems, such as those\nused for attitude control of flying vehicles, often with more than one thrust cham-\nber per engine. Pump-fed liquid rocket systems are used typically in applications\nwith larger amounts of propellants and higher thrusts, such as in space launch\nvehicles. See Refs. 1-1 to 1-6.\n*The term thrust chamber, used for the assembly of the injector, nozzle, and chamber, is preferred\nby several official agencies and therefore has been used in this book. For small spacecraft control\nrockets the term thruster (a small thrust chamber) is commonly used, and this term will be used in\nsome sections of this book.\n",

Once ignited, it usually burns smoothly at a predetermined rate on all the\nexposed internal surfaces of the grain. Initial burning takes place at the internal\nsurfaces of the cylinder perforation and the four slots. The internal cavity grows\nas propellant is burned and consumed. The resulting hot gas flows through the\nsupersonic nozzle to impart thrust. Once ignited, the motor combustion proceeds\nin an orderly manner until essentially all the propellant has been consumed. There\nare no feed systems or valves. See Refs. 1-7 to 1-10.\n\nLiquid and solid propellants, and the propulsion systems that use them, are dis-\ncussed in Chapters 6 to 11 and 12 to 15, respectively. Liquid and solid propellant\nrocket propulsion systems are compared in Chapter 19.\n\nGaseous propellant rocket engines use a stored high-pressure gas, such as air,\nnitrogen, or helium, as their working fluid or propellant. The stored gas requires\nrelatively heavy tanks. These cold gas engines have been used on many early\nspace vehicles for low thrust maneuvers and for attitude control systems and\nsome are still used today. Heating the gas by electrical energy or by combus-\ntion of certain monopropellants improves the performance and this has often\nbeen called warm gas propellant rocket propulsion. Chapter 7 discusses gaseous\npropellants.\n\nHybrid propellant rocket propulsion systems use both a liquid and a solid\npropellant. For example, if a liquid oxidizing agent is injected into a combus-\ntion chamber filled with a solid carbonaceous fuel grain, the chemical reaction\nproduces hot combustion gases (see Fig. 1-6). They are described further in\nChapter 16. Several have flown successfully.\n",

The solid propellant rocket booster lifts the missile away from its\nlaunch platform and is discarded after its operation. A small turbojet engine\nsustains the low-level flight at nearly constant speed toward the target.\n\nA ducted rocket, sometimes called an air-augmented rocket, combines the\nprinciples of rocket and ramjet engines; it gives higher performance (specific\nimpulse) than a chemical rocket engine, while operating within the earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere. Usually the term air-augmented rocket denotes mixing of air with the\nrocket exhaust (fuel rich for afterburning) in proportions that enable the propul-\nsion device to retain the characteristics typifying a rocket engine, for example,\nhigh static thrust and high thrust-to-weight ratio. In contrast, the ducted rocket\noften is like a ramjet in that it must be boosted to operating speed and uses the\nrocket components more as a fuel-rich gas generator (liquid or solid).\n\nThe principles of the rocket and ramjet can be combined. An example of\nthese two propulsion systems operating in sequence and in tandem and yet\nutilize a common combustion chamber volume as shown in Fig. 1-7. The low-\nvolume configuration, known as an integral rocket\u2014ramjet, can be attractive in\nair-launched missiles using ramjet propulsion. The transition from the rocket\nto the ramjet requires enlarging the exhaust nozzle throat (usually by ejecting\nrocket nozzle parts), opening the ramjet air inlet-combustion chamber interface,\nand following these two events with the normal ramjet starting sequence.\n\nA solid fuel ramjet uses a grain of solid fuel that gasifies or ablates and\nreacts with air. Good combustion efficiencies have been achieved with a patented\nboron-containing solid fuel fabricated into a grain similar to a solid propellant\nand burning in a manner similar to a hybrid rocket propulsion system.\n",

After the solid propellant has been consumed in boosting the vehicle to flight speed,\nthe rocket combustion chamber becomes the ramjet combustion chamber with air burning\nthe ramjet liquid fuel.\nNuclear Rocket Engines\nTwo different types of nuclear energy sources have been investigated for deliv-\nering heat to a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, which subsequently can\nbe expanded in a nozzle and thus accelerated to high ejection velocities (6000\nto 11,000 m/sec). However, none can be considered fully developed today and\nnone have flown. They are the fission reactor and the fusion reactor. Both are\nbasically extensions of liquid propellant rocket engines. The heating of the gas is\naccomplished by energy derived from transformations within the nuclei of atoms.\nIn chemical rockets the energy is obtained from within the propellants, but in\nnuclear rockets the power source is usually separate from the propellant.\n\nIn the nuclear fission reactor rocket, heat can be generated by the fission of\nuranium in the solid reactor material and subsequently transferred to the work-\ning fluid (see Refs. 1-11 to 1-13). The nuclear fission rocket is primarily a\nhigh-thrust engine (above 40,000 N) with specific impulse values up to 900 sec.\nFission rockets were designed and tested in the 1960s in the United States and\nalso in the Soviet Union, which today is Russia. Ground tests with hydrogen\nas a working fluid culminated in a thrust of 980,000 N (210,000 1b force) at a\ngraphite core nuclear reactor power level of 4100 MW with an equivalent altitude-\nspecific impulse of 848 sec and a hydrogen temperature of about 2500 K. There\nwere concerns with the endurance of the materials at the high temperature (above\n2600 K) and intense radiations, power level control, cooling a reactor after oper-\nation, moderating the high-energy neutrons, and designing lightweight radiation\nshields for a manned space vehicle. No further ground tests of nuclear fission\nrocket engines have been undertaken.\n\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest in nuclear fission rocket propul-\nsion primarily for a potential manned planetary exploration mission. Studies\nhave shown that the high specific impulse (estimated in some studies at 1100\nsec) allows shorter interplanetary trip transfer times, smaller vehicles, and more\nflexibility in the launch time when planets are not in their optimum relative\nposition. See Refs. 1-11 and 1-13.\n",
    "28": "1.2. ROCKET PROPULSION 11\n\nFusion is an alternate way to create nuclear energy, which can heat a working\nfluid. A number of different concepts have been studied. To date none are feasible\nor practical.\n\nConcerns about an accident with the inadvertent spreading of radioactive mate-\nrials in the earth environment and the high cost of development programs have\nto date prevented a renewed experimental development of a large nuclear rocket\nengine. Unless there are some new findings and a change in world attitude about\nnuclear radiation, it is unlikely that a nuclear rocket engine will be developed or\nflown in the next few decades. Therefore no further discussion of it is given in\nthis book.\n\nElectric Rocket Propulsion\n\nIn all electric propulsion the source of the electric power (nuclear, solar radiation\nreceivers, or batteries) is physically separate from the mechanism that produces\nthe thrust. This type of propulsion requires a heavy and inefficient power sources\nas discussed below. The thrust usually is low, typically 0.005 to 1 N. In order to\nallow a significant increase in the vehicle velocity, it is necessary to apply the\nlow thrust and thus a small acceleration for a long time (weeks or months) (see\nChapter 17 and Refs. 1-14 and 1-15).\n\nOf the three basic types, electrothermal rocket propulsion most resembles\nthe previously mentioned chemical rocket units; propellant is heated electrically\n(by heated resistors or electric arcs), and the hot gas is then thermodynamically\nexpanded and accelerated to supersonic velocity through an exhaust nozzle (see\nFig. 1-8). These electrothermal units typically have thrust ranges of 0.01 to 0.5 N,\nwith exhaust velocities of 1000 to 5000 m/sec, and ammonium, hydrogen, nitro-\ngen, or hydrazine decomposition product gases have been used as propellants.\n\nThe two other types\u2014the electrostatic or ion propulsion engine and the\nelectromagnetic or magnetoplasma engine\u2014accomplish propulsion by differ-\nent principles, and the thermodynamic expansion of gas in a nozzle, as such,\ndoes not apply. Both will work only in a vacuum. In an ion rocket (see Fig. 1\u20149)\na working fluid (typically, xenon) is ionized (by stripping off electrons), and then\nthe electrically charged heavy ions are accelerated to very high velocities (2000\nto 60,000 m/sec) by means of electrostatic fields. The ions are subsequently elec-\ntrically neutralized; they are combined with electrons to prevent the buildup of\na space charge on the vehicle.\n\nIn the magnetoplasma rocket an electrical plasma (an energized hot gas con-\ntaining ions, electrons, and neutral particles) is accelerated by the interaction\nbetween electric currents and magnetic fields and ejected at high velocity (1000\nto 50,000 m/sec). There are many different types and geometries. The Hall-effect\nthruster, which accelerates a plasma, has a good flight record in Russia. A simple\npulsed (not continuously operating) electrical propulsion unit with a solid pro-\npellant is shown in Fig. 1-10. It has had a good flight record as a spacecraft\nattitude control engine.\n",

Solar cells\ngenerate electric power from the sun\u2019s radiation. They are well developed and\nhave been successful for several decades. Most electric propulsion systems have\nused solar cells for their power supply. Batteries and isotope decay power sources\nhave also been used.\n\nOne concept is the solar thermal rocket; it has large-diameter optics to concen-\ntrate the sun\u2019s radiation (e.g., by lightweight precise parabolic mirrors or Fresnel\nlenses) onto a receiver or optical cavity. Figure 1-11 shows one concept and\nsome data is given in Table 2\u20141. The receiver is made of high-temperature metal\n(such as tungsten or rhenium) and has a cooling jacket or heat exchanger. It\nheats a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, up to perhaps 2500\u00b0C and the hot\ngas is controlled by hot gas valves and exhausted through one or more nozzles.\nThe large mirror has to be pointed toward the sun, and this usually requires the\nmirror to be adjustable in its orientation as the spacecraft orbits around the earth.\n",

There is\nmention in this book of a few foreign rocket units and their accomplishments\nand references to international rocket literature. Although most of the data in\nthis book are taken from U.S. rocket experience, this is not intended to minimize\nforeign achievements.\n\nAt the time of this writing the major international program has been the\nInternational Space Station (ISS), a multiyear cooperative effort with major con-\ntributions from the United States and Russia and active participation by several\nother nations. This manned orbital space station is used for conducting experi-\nments and observations on a number of research projects. See Ref. 1-19.\n\n1.3. APPLICATIONS OF ROCKET PROPULSION\n\nBecause the rocket can reach a performance unequaled by other prime movers,\nit has its own fields of application and does not usually compete with other\npropulsion devices. Examples of important applications are given below and\ndiscussed further in Chapter 4.\n\nSpace Launch Vehicles\n\nBetween the first space launch in 1957 and the end of 1998 approximately 4102\nspace launch attempts have taken place in the world and all but about 129 were\nsuccessful (see Ref. 1-20). Space launch vehicles or space boosters can be clas-\nsified broadly as expendable or recoverable/reusable. Other bases of classification\nare the type of propellant (storable or cryogenic liquid or solid propellants), num-\nber of stages (single-stage, two-stage, etc.), size/mass of payloads or vehicles,\nand manned or unmanned.\n\nEach space launch has a specific space flight objective, such as an earth orbit\nor a moon landing.

The number of stages depends on the specific space\ntrajectory, the number and types of maneuvers, the energy content of a unit mass\nof the propellant, payload size, and other factors. The initial stage, usually called\nthe booster stage, is the largest and it is operated first; this stage is then separated\nfrom the ascending vehicle before the second-stage rocket propulsion system is\nignited and operated. As will be explained in Chapter 4, adding an extra stage\npermits a significant increase in the payload (such as more scientific instruments\nor more communications gear).\n\nEach stage of a multistage launch vehicle is essentially a complete vehicle in\nitself and carries its own propellant, its own rocket propulsion system or systems,\nand its own control system. Once the propellant of a given stage is expended, the\nremaining mass of that stage (including empty tanks, cases, structure, instruments,\netc.) is no longer useful in providing additional kinetic energy to the succeeding\nstages. By dropping off this useless mass it is possible to accelerate the final\nstage with its useful payload to a higher terminal velocity than would be attained\nif multiple staging were not used. Both solid propellant and liquid propellant\nrocket propulsion systems have been used for low earth orbits.\n\nFigure 1-12 shows the Delta IV heavy-lift space launch vehicle at takeoff.\nIts propellants are liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen (LOX/LHz2) in all its main\nengines. Its booster engine, the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RS-68, is shown\nin Fig. 6-10 and data is in Table 11-2 and its second-stage engine, the Pratt\n& Whitney Rocketdyne RL 10B-2 LOX/LH) (24,750 Ib thrust) is shown in Fig.\n8-17 and data is in Table 8\u20141. The two liquid propellant strap-on booster pods\n(with the same booster engine) are removed for smaller payloads. Figure 1-13\nshows the Atlas V space launch vehicle. Its booster engine is the Energomash\nRD-180, it has Aerojet solid propellant strap-on boosters, and the upper stage\nengine is the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RL 10A-4-2 LOX/LH) engine. The\nRussian (Energomash) LOX/kerosene RD-180 engine is shown in Ref. 1-2 as its\nFigure 7.10-11 and data is in its Table 7.10-2. In both of these two launch vehicles\nthe payload is carried on top of the second stage and it has its own propulsion\nsystem of small thrusters. Table 1-3 gives data of the larger propulsion systems\nof these two U.S. launch vehicles.\n\nThe U.S. Space Shuttle is one of the older programs and it provided the\nfirst reusable spacecraft that lands on a runway. Figure 1\u201414 shows the basic\nconfiguration of the Space Shuttle, which consists of two stages, the booster and\nthe orbiter. It shows all the 67 rocket propulsion systems of the shuttle. The\norbiter is really a reusable combination space launch vehicle, spacecraft, and\nglider for landing. The two solid propellant strap-on rocket motors are the largest\nin existence; they are equipped with parachutes for sea recovery of the burned-out\nmotors. The large LO,/LH) external tank is jettisoned and expended just before\norbit insertion (see Ref. 1-22). Details of several of these Space Shuttle rocket\npropulsion systems are given in Table 1-4.

    "38": "1.3. APPLICATIONS OF ROCKET PROPULSION 21\n\nTable 1\u20144 gives propulsion system data on the Space Shuttle, which is really\na combination of launch vehicle, spacecraft, and a glider. It can be seen that\nthe thrust levels are highest for booster or first stages and are relatively high for\nupper stages (thousands of pounds). Only for the attitude control system of the\nvehicle (also called reaction control in Table 1\u20144) are the thrust levels low (from\na fraction of a pound for small spacecraft to as high as about 1000 pounds thrust\nin the Space Shuttle vehicle). Frequent propulsion starts and stops are usually\nrequired in these applications.\n\nAt the time of this writing (early 2008) for this new 8th edition National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had awarded the initial contracts\nfor a new large manned space flight vehicle identified as Ares I. It is intended\nto replace the aging Space Shuttle after about 2012. It is planned to use a large\nsingle 5-segment solid rocket motor as booster propulsion (being developed by\nATK Launch Systems) and the second stage will use a J-2X liquid propellant\nrocket engine with LOX/LH2 propellants (being developed by Pratt & Whitney\nRocketdyne).\n\nA new set of manned space flight vehicles are currently being developed by\nseveral entrepreneurial US and foreign companies, many with their own private\ncapital. They are aimed at the future commercial market of sending tourists\n(for a hefty price) into space and returning them safely back to earth. All are\nbased on reusable spacecraft, some with reusable launch vehicles, some with\nvertical and some with horizontal takeoff or landing. A couple of suborbital flights\nhave already been accomplished with professional pilots using a winged vehicle.\nLiquid propellant rocket engines seem to be preferred and many are planned to\nbe reusable. It is too early for determining which of these organizations will be\nsuccessful in commercializing manned space flight.\n\nThe missions and payloads for space launch vehicles are many, such as\nmilitary (reconnaissance satellites, command and control satellites), nonmili-\ntary government [weather observation satellites, global positioning system (GPS)\nsatellites], space exploration (space environment, planetary missions), or com-\nmercial (communication satellites).\n\nA single stage-to-orbit vehicle, attractive because it avoids the costs and com-\nplexities of staging, has been expected to have improved reliability (simpler\nstructures, fewer components). However, its payload is usually too small. A low\nearth orbit (say 100 miles altitude) can only be achieved with such a vehicle\nif the propellant performance is very high and the structure is efficient and low\nin mass. Liquid propellants such as liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen were\nusually chosen. To date a large rocket-propelled single stage-to-orbit vehicle has\nnot flown.\n\nSpacecraft\n\nDepending on their missions, spacecraft can be categorized as earth satellites,\nlunar, interplanetary, and trans-solar types, and as manned and unmanned\nspacecraft. Reference 1\u201423 lists over 20,000 satellites and categorizes them as\nsatellites for communications, weather, navigation, scientific exploration, deep\n",
    "39": "22 CLASSIFICATION\n\nspace probes, observation (including radar surveillance), reconnaissance and\nother applications. Rocket propulsion is used for both primary propulsion (i.e.,\nacceleration along the flight path, such as for orbit insertion or orbit change\nmaneuvers) and secondary propulsion functions in these vehicles. Some of the\nsecondary propulsion functions are attitude control, spin control, momentum\nwheel and gyro unloading, stage separation, and the settling of liquids in tanks.\nA spacecraft usually has a series of different rocket propulsion systems, some\noften very small. For spacecraft attitude control about three perpendicular axes,\neach in two rotational directions, the system must allow the application of pure\ntorque for six modes of angular freedom, thus requiring a minimum of 12\nthrusters. Some missions require as few as 4 to 6 thrusters, whereas the more\ncomplex manned spacecraft have 40 to 80 thrusters in all of its stages. Often\nthe small attitude control rockets must give pulses or short bursts of thrust,\nnecessitating thousands of restarts. See Section 6.7 and Ref. 1-24.\n\nTable 1\u20145 presents a variety of spacecraft along with their weights, missions,\nand propulsion. Although only U.S. launch vehicles are listed in this table, there\nare also launch vehicles developed by France, the European Space Agency, Rus-\nsia, Japan, China, India, and Israel that have successfully launched payloads into\nsatellite orbits. They use rocket propulsion systems that were developed in their\nown countries.\n\nThe majority of spacecraft have used liquid propellant engines, a few with solid\npropellant boosters. Many spacecraft have operated successfully with electrical\npropulsion for attitude control. Electrical propulsion systems will probably also\nbe used for some primary and secondary spacecraft propulsion missions on long-\nduration space flights, as described in Chapter 17.\n\nMicropropulsion is a relatively new designation. It has been defined as any\nrocket propulsion system that is applicable to small spacecraft with a mass of\nless than 100 kg, or 220 Ib. See Ref. 1-25. It encompasses a variety of different\npropulsion concepts, such as certain very low thrust liquid mono- and bipropellant\nrocket engines, small gaseous propellant rocket engines, several types of electrical\npropulsion systems, and emerging advanced versions of these. Many are based\non fabrication of very small components (valves, thrusters, switches, insulators,\nor sensors) by micromachining and electromechanical processes.\n\nMissiles and Other Applications\n\nMilitary missiles can be classified as shown in Table 1\u20146. Rocket propulsion for\nnew U.S. missiles uses now almost exclusively solid propellant rocket motors.\nThey can be strategic missiles, such as long-range ballistic missiles (800 to\n9000 km range), which are aimed at military targets within an enemy country, or\ntactical missiles, which are intended to support or defend military ground forces,\naircraft, or navy ships.\n\nTables 1-6 and 1-7 show some parameters of rocket propulsion devices\nfor different applications. The selection of the best rocket propulsion system\ntype and design for any given application is a complex process involving many\nfactors, including system performance, reliability, propulsion system size, and\ncompatibility, as described in Chapter 19.\n",

Some tactical\nmissiles, such as the air-to-surface short-range attack missile (SRAM), have a\ntwo-pulse solid propellant motor, where two separate, insulated grains are in the\nsame motor case; the time interval before starting the second pulse can be timed to\ncontrol the flight path or speed profile. Most countries now have tactical missiles\nin their military inventories, and many of these countries have a capability to\nproduce their own rocket propulsion systems that are used to propel them.\n\nSolid propellant rocket motors are being used today in most tactical missiles,\nsuch as in surface-to-air, air-to-air, air-to-surface, and surface-to-surface appli-\ncations, for the ejection of pilot aircraft seats or crew capsules, target drones,\nsignal rockets, weather sounding rockets, antitank rockets, or for the separations\nof stages in a multistage flight vehicle.\n\nApplications, which were popular 30 to 60 years ago, but are no longer active,\ninclude liquid propellant rocket engines for propelling military fighter aircraft,\nassisted takeoff rocket engines and rocket motors, and superperformance rocket\nengines for augmenting the thrust of an aircraft jet engine.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1-1.

    "45": "CHAPTER 2\nSS\nThe basic principles of rocket propulsion are essentially those of mechanics,\nthermodynamics, and chemistry. Propulsion is achieved by applying a force to\na vehicle, that is, accelerating the vehicle or, alternatively, maintaining a given\nvelocity against a resisting force. This propulsive force is obtained by ejecting\npropellant at high velocity. This chapter deals with the definitions and the basic\nrelations of this propulsive force, the exhaust velocity, and the efficiencies of\ncreating and converting the energy and other basic parameters. The symbols\nused in the equations are defined at the end of the chapter. Wherever possible\nthe American Standard letter symbols for rocket propulsion (as given in Ref.\n2-1) are used.\n2.1. DEFINITIONS\nThe total impulse I, is the thrust force F (which can vary with time) integrated\nover the burning time ft:\nt\nh= i Fat 2-1)\n0\nFor constant thrust and very short start and stop transients this reduces to\nI, = Ft (2-2)\n\nImpulse J, is proportional to the total energy released by all the propellant in a\npropulsion system.\n28\n",
    "46": "2.1. DEFINITIONS 29\nThe specific impulse 1; is the total impulse per unit weight of propellant. It is\nan important figure of merit of the performance of a rocket propulsion system,\nsimilar in concept to the miles per gallon parameter used with automobiles.\nA higher number means better performance. Values of J, are given in many\nchapters of this book, and the concept of an optimum specific impulse for a\nparticular mission is introduced later. If the total mass flow rate of propellant is\nm and the standard acceleration of gravity at sea level go is 9.8066 m/sec? or\n32.174 ft/sec\u201d, then\nI, i 0 fa 2-3\n\"go fm dt 2-3)\nThis equation will give a time-averaged specific impulse value for any rocket\npropulsion system, particularly where the thrust varies with time. During tran-\nsient conditions (during start or the thrust buildup period, the shutdown period,\nor during a change of flow or thrust levels) values of J; can be obtained by inte-\ngration or by determining average values for F and m for short time intervals.\nFor constant thrust and propellant flow this equation can be simplified; below,\nMp is the total effective propellant mass expelled through the nozzle.\nI; = 1;/(mp go) (2-4)\nIn Chapter 3 there is further discussion of the specific impulse. For constant\npropellant mass flow m, constant thrust F\u2019, and negligibly short start or stop\ntransients:\nI; = F/(mgo) = F/w\n1, /(mpgo) = I,/w (2-5)\nat or near the earth\u2019s surface, the product mp go is the total effective propellant\nweight w, and the weight flow rate is w. But in space or outer satellite orbits,\nthe mass is just multiplied by an arbitrary constant, namely go. In the Systeme\nInternational (SI) or metric system of units J, can be expressed simply in \u201csec-\nonds\u201d because of the use of the constant go. In the United States today we still\nuse the English Engineering (EE) system of units (foot, pound, second) in many\nof the chemical propulsion engineering, manufacturing, and test operations. In\nmany past and current U.S. publications, data, and contracts, the specific impulse\nhas units of thrust (1bf) divided by weight flow rate of propellants (1bf/sec),\nsimplified as seconds. The numerical value of /; is the same in the EE and\nthe SI system of units. However, the units of J; do not represent a measure of\nelapsed time but a thrust force per unit \u201cweight\u201d flow rate. In this book the\nsymbol J, is used for the specific impulse, as listed in Ref. 2\u20141. For solid pro-\npellant and several other rocked systems the symbol /,, is often used, as listed in\nRef. 2-2.\n",
    "47": "30 DEFINITIONS AND FUNDAMENTALS\n\nIn a rocket nozzle the actual exhaust velocity is not uniform over the entire\nexit cross section and does not represent the entire thrust magnitude. The velocity\nprofile is difficult to measure accurately. For convenience a uniform axial velocity\nc is assumed, which allows a one-dimensional description of the problem. This\neffective exhaust velocity c is the average equivalent velocity at which propellant\nis ejected from the vehicle. It is defined as\n\nc=1sg9 =F /m (2-6)\nIt is given either in meters per second or feet per second. Since c and J, differ\nonly by an arbitrary constant, either one can be used as a measure of rocket\nperformance. In the Russian literature c is generally used in lieu of J,.\n\nIn solid propellant rockets it is difficult to measure the propellant flow rate\naccurately. Therefore, the specific impulse is often calculated from total impulse\nand the propellant weight (using the difference between initial and final motor\nweights and Eq. 2\u20145). In turn the total impulse is obtained from the integral of the\nmeasured thrust with time, using Eq. 2\u20141. In liquid propellant units it is possible\nto measure thrust and instantaneous propellant flow rate and thus to use Eq. 2-3\nfor calculation of specific impulse. Equation 2\u20144 allows another definition for\nspecific impulse, namely, the amount of impulse imparted to a vehicle per unit\nsea-level weight of propellant expended.\n\nThe term specific propellant consumption refers to the reciprocal of the specific\nimpulse and is not commonly used in rocket propulsion. It is used in automotive\nand duct propulsion systems. Typical values are listed in Table 1-2.\n\nThe mass ratio MR of a vehicle or a particular vehicle stage is defined to\nbe the final mass my (after rocket operation has consumed all usable propel-\nlant) divided by mo (before rocket operation). The various terms are depicted in\nFig. 4-1.\n\nMR = m/mo (2-7)\n\nThis applies to a single or a multistage vehicle; for the latter, the overall mass\nratio is the product of the individual vehicle stage mass ratios. The final mass\nmy is the mass of the vehicle after the rocket has ceased to operate when all\nthe useful propellant mass m, has been consumed and ejected. The final vehicle\nmass my includes all those components that are not useful propellant and may\ninclude guidance devices, navigation gear, payload (e.g., scientific instruments\nor a military warhead), flight control systems, communication devices, power\nsupplies, tank structure, residual or unusable propellant, and all the propulsion\nhardware. In some vehicles it can also include wings, fins, a crew, life support\nsystems, reentry shields, landing gears, and the like. Typical values of MR can\nrange from 60% for some tactical missiles to less than 10% for some unmanned\nlaunch vehicle stages. This mass ratio is an important parameter in analyzing\nflight performance, as explained in Chapter 4. When MR is applied to a single\nstage, then its upper stages become the \u201cpayload.\u201d\n",
    "48": "2.1. DEFINITIONS 31\n\nThe propellant mass fraction \u00a2 indicates the fraction of propellant mass mp\nin an initial mass mo. It can be applied to a vehicle, a stage of a vehicle, or to a\nrocket propulsion system.\n\nf= my/mo (2-8)\n\u00a3 = (mp \u2014 my) /mg = my / (mp, + ms) (2-9)\nmo = mg + Mp (2-10)\n\nWhen applied to a rocket propulsion system, the mass ratio MR and propellant\nfraction \u00a2 are different from those that apply to a vehicle as described above.\nHere the initial or loaded mass mo consists of the inert propulsion mass (the\nhardware necessary to burn and store the propellant) and the effective propellant\nmass. It would exclude masses of nonpropulsive components, such as payload or\nguidance devices. For example, in a liquid propellant rocket engine the final or\ninert propulsion mass my would include the propellant feed tanks, their pressur-\nization system (with turbopump and/or gas pressure system), one or more thrust\nchambers, various piping, fittings and valves, an engine mount or engine struc-\nture, filters, and some sensors. The residual or unusable remaining propellant\nis usually considered to be part of the final inert mass my, as it will be in this\nbook. However, some rocket propulsion manufacturers and some literature assign\nresiduals to be part of the propellant mass m,. When applied to a rocket propul-\nsion system, the value of the propellant mass fraction \u00a2 indicates the quality of\nthe design; a value of, say, 0.91 means that only 9% of the mass is inert rocket\nhardware, and this small fraction contains, feeds, and burns a substantially larger\nmass of propellant. A high value of \u00a2 is desirable.\n\nThe impulse-to-weight ratio of a complete propulsion system is defined as the\ntotal impulse /, divided by the initial or propellant-loaded vehicle weight wo. A\nhigh value indicates an efficient design. Under our assumptions of constant thrust\nand negligible start and stop transients, it can be expressed as\n\nfu = \u2014 (2-11)\nwo (mp + Mp) 80\nIs\n= \u2014\u2014 (2-12)\nmy [My +1\n\nThe thrust-to-weight ratio F /wo expresses the acceleration (in multiples of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface acceleration of gravity) that the engine is capable of giving\nto its own loaded propulsion system mass. For constant thrust the maximum\nvalue of the thrust-to-weight ratio, or maximum acceleration, occurs just before\ntermination or burnout because the vehicle mass has been diminished by the mass\nof useful propellant. Values of F/w are given in Table 2\u20141. The thrust-to-weight\nratio is useful to compare different types of rocket systems.\n",

A rocket projectile has the following characteristics:\nInitial mass 200 kg\nMass after rocket operation 130 kg\nPayload, nonpropulsive structure, etc. 110 kg\nRocket operation duration 3.0 sec\nAverage specific impulse of propellant 240 sec\n\nDetermine the mass ratios for the overall vehicle and for the propulsive unit, the\npropellant mass fraction for the propulsive unit, the effective exhaust velocity, and the total\nimpulse. Also, sensitive electronic equipment in the payload would limit the maximum\nacceleration to 35go\u2019s. Is this exceeded during the flight? Assume constant thrust and\nneglect the short start and stop transients.\n\nSOLUTION. From the givens, the mass of the expended propellant is 70 kg. The mass\nratio (Eq. 2-8) for the vehicle is therefore MR = my /mo = 130/200 = 0.65, and the the\npropulsion unit is (130 \u2014 110)/(200 \u2014 110) = 0.222. Note that these are different. Now\nthe propellant mass fraction of the propulsion system is\n\u00a2 = 70/(200 \u2014 110) = 0.778\n\nNote that this mass fraction is acceptable for tactical missiles but might be only \u201cfair\u201d\nfor spacecraft. Because the effective exhaust velocity is proportional to the specific\nimpulse, c = 240 x 9.81 = 2354.4 m/sec. The propellant mass flow rate is mi = 70/3 =\n23.3 kg/sec and the thrust becomes (Eq. 2-5)\n\nF = 23.3 x 2354.4 = 54,936 N\nNow the total impulse can be calculated as J, = 54936 x 3 = 164,808 N-sec. The\nimpulse-to-weight ratio (Eq. 2-11) for the propulsion system at the earth\u2019s surface is\nI,/wo = 164,808/[(200 \u2014 110)9.81] = 187 sec (this reflects only a fair design because\nI, = 240 sec).\n\nFor a horizontal trajectory, the maximum acceleration is found at the end of the\nthrusting schedule just before shutdown (because while the thrust is unchanged the mass\nis now at its minimum value of 130 kg).\n\nFinal acceleration = F'/m = 54,936/130 = 422.58 m/sec\u201d\n\nThis represents 43.08 go\u2019s, at the earth\u2019s surface and exceeds the limit of the\n\nequipment.\n\n2.2.

In the latter case, the\nforward momentum of the bullet and the powder charge is equal to the recoil\nor rearward momentum of the gun barrel. Momentum is a vector quantity and\nis defined as the product of mass times velocity. All ship propellers and oars\ngenerate their forward push at the expense of the momentum of the water or air\nmasses, which are accelerated toward the rear. Rocket propulsion differs from\nthese devices primarily in the relative magnitude of the accelerated masses and\nvelocities. In rocket propulsion relatively small masses are involved that are\ncarried within the vehicle and ejected at high velocities.\n\nThe thrust, due to a change in momentum, is given below. A derivation can be\nfound in earlier editions of this book. The thrust and the mass flow are constant\nand the gas exit velocity is uniform and axial.\n\ndm . w\nF= \u2014 v2 = Mv\u20192 = \u2014v2 (2-13)\ndt 80\nThis force represents the total propulsion force when the nozzle exit pressure\nequals the ambient pressure.\n\nThe pressure of the surrounding fluid (i.e., the local atmosphere) gives rise to\nthe second contribution that influences the thrust.

The forces\nacting radially outward are appreciable but do not contribute to the axial thrust\nbecause a rocket is typically an axially symmetric chamber. The conditions prior\nto entering the nozzle are essentially stagnation conditions.\n\nBecause of a fixed nozzle geometry and changes in ambient pressure due to\nvariations in altitude, there can be an imbalance of the external environment\nor atmospheric pressure p3 and the local pressure p2 of the hot gas jet at the\nexit plane of the nozzle. Thus, for a steadily operating rocket propulsion system\nmoving through a homogeneous atmosphere, the total thrust is equal to (this\nequation is arrived at using the control volume approach in gas dynamics; see\nRefs. 2\u20143 and 2-4):\n\nF = mv? + (p2 \u2014 p3)A2 (2-14)\n\nThe first term is the momentum thrust represented by the product of the pro-\npellant mass flow rate and its exhaust velocity relative to the vehicle. The second\nterm represents the pressure thrust consisting of the product of the cross-sectional\narea at the nozzle exit Az (where the exhaust jet leaves the vehicle) and the differ-\nence between the exhaust gas pressure at the exit and the ambient fluid pressure.\nIf the exhaust pressure is less than the surrounding fluid pressure, the pressure\nthrust is negative. Because this condition gives a low thrust and is undesirable,\nthe rocket nozzle is usually so designed that the exhaust pressure is equal or\nslightly higher than the ambient fluid pressure.\n\nWhen the ambient atmosphere pressure is equal to the exhaust pressure, the\npressure term is zero and the thrust is the same as in Eq. 2-13. In the vacuum\nof space p3 = 0 and the thrust becomes\n\nF =mv2+ p2A2 (2-15)\n\nAt the altitude where the exhaust pressure is exactly equal to the surrounding\nfluid pressure (p2 = p3) the pressure thrust is zero. For any nozzle this occurs\nonly at one attitude, and this is referred to as the rocket nozzle with optimum\nnozzle expansion ratio Az/A,. This is further elaborated in Chapter 3.\n\nEquation 2\u201414 shows that the thrust of a rocket unit is independent of the\nflight velocity. Because changes in ambient pressure affect the pressure thrust,\nthere is a variation of the rocket thrust with altitude. Because atmospheric pressure\ndecreases with increasing altitude, the thrust and the specific impulse will increase\nas the vehicle is propelled to higher altitudes. This change in pressure thrust due\nto altitude changes can amount to between 10 and 30% of the overall thrust, as is\nshown for a typical rocket engine in Fig. 2-2. Table 8\u20141 shows the sea level and\nhigh-altitude thrust for several rocket engines. Appendix 2 gives the properties\nof the standard atmosphere (ambient pressure p3).\n",

The second term of the right-hand side of Eq. 2-16 is usually small\nin relation to v2; thus the effective exhaust velocity is usually close in value to\nthe actual exhaust velocity.

ENERGY AND EFFICIENCIES\nAlthough efficiencies are not commonly used directly in designing rocket units,\nthey permit an understanding of the energy balance of a rocket system. Their\ndefinitions are arbitrary, depending on the losses considered, and any consistent\nset of efficiencies, such as the one presented in this section, is satisfactory in\nevaluating energy losses. As stated previously, two types of energy conversion\nprocesses occur in any propulsion system, namely, the generation of energy,\nwhich is really the conversion of stored energy into available energy and, subse-\nquently, the conversion to the form in which a reaction thrust can be obtained.\nThe kinetic energy of ejected matter is the form of energy useful for propulsion.\nThe power of the jet Pict is the time rate of expenditure of this energy, and for a\nconstant gas ejection velocity v this is a function of J, and F:\n\nPret = grav? = Frigol? = 4F gols = F v2 (2-19)\n\nThe term specific power is sometimes used as a measure of the utilization\nof the mass of the propulsion system including its power source; it is the jet\npower divided by the loaded propulsion system mass, Pj/mo. For electrical\npropulsion systems that carry a heavy, relatively inefficient energy source, the\nspecific power can be much lower than that of chemical rockets. The energy input\nfrom the energy source to the rocket propulsion system has different forms in\ndifferent rocket types. For chemical rockets the energy is created by combustion.\nThe maximum energy available per unit mass of chemical propellants is the heat\nof the combustion reaction Qr; the power input to a chemical engine is\n\nPehem = MQRJ (2-20)\nwhere J is a conversion constant that depends on the units used. A large portion of\nthe energy of the exhaust gases is unavailable for conversion into kinetic energy\nand leaves the nozzle as residual enthalpy. This is analogous to the energy lost\nin the hot exhaust gases of internal combustion engines.\n\nThe combustion efficiency for chemical rockets is the ratio of the actual and\nthe ideal heat of reaction per unit of propellant and is a measure of the source\nefficiency for creating energy. Its value is high (approximately 94 to 99%), and it\nis defined in Chapter 3. When the power input Pchem is multiplied by the combus-\ntion efficiency, it becomes the power available to the propulsive device, where it\nis converted into the kinetic power of the exhaust jet. In electric propulsion the\nanalogous efficiency is the power conversion efficiency. For solar cells it has a\nlow value; it is the efficiency for converting solar radiation energy into electric\npower (10 to 20%).\n\nThe power transmitted to the vehicle at any one time is defined in terms of\nthe thrust of the propulsion system F and the vehicle velocity u:\n\nPyehicle = Fu (2-21)\n",
    "56": "2.4. ENERGY AND EFFICIENCIES 39\nThe internal efficiency of a rocket propulsion system is an indication of the effec-\ntiveness of converting the system\u2019s energy input to the propulsion device into\nthe kinetic energy of the ejected matter; for example, for a chemical unit it is the\nratio of the kinetic power of the ejected gases expressed by Eq. 2-19 divided by\nthe power input of the chemical reaction as given in Eq. 2\u201420. Internal efficien-\ncies are used in Example 2\u20144. The energy balance diagram for a chemical rocket\n\n(Fig. 2\u20143) shows typical losses.

Then the residual\nkinetic energy and the absolute velocity of the jet are zero and the exhaust gases\nstand still in space.\n\nWhile it is desirable to use energy economically and thus have high efficien-\ncies, there is also the problem of minimizing the expenditure of ejected mass,\nwhich in many cases is more important than minimizing the energy. In nuclear\nreactor energy and some solar energy sources, for example, there is an almost\nunlimited amount of heat energy available; yet the vehicle can only carry a limited\namount of working fluid. Economy of mass expenditures of working fluid can be\nobtained if the exhaust velocity is high. Because the specific impulse is propor-\ntional to the exhaust velocity, it is a measure of this propellant mass economy.\n2.5. MULTIPLE PROPULSION SYSTEMS\nThe relationships below are for determining the overall (oa) or total thrust and the\noverall mass flow of propellants for a group of propulsion systems (two or more)\nfiring in parallel (i.e., in the same direction at the same time). These relationships\napply to liquid propellant rocket engines, solid propellant rocket motors, electrical\npropulsion systems, hybrid propulsion systems, and to any combinations of these.\nMany space launch vehicles and larger missiles have multiple propulsion systems.\nThe Space Shuttle, for example, has three larger liquid engines and two large\nsolid motors firing jointly at liftoff.\n\nThe overall thrust, Foa, is needed for determining the flight path, and the overall\nmass flow rate, oa, is needed for determining the vehicle\u2019s mass decrease with\ntime.

The MA-3 multiple liquid engine for the Atlas missile has two booster\nengines (F = 165,000 Ibf at sea level and m = 66.7lbm/sec each). The turbine exhaust\ngas of both boosters provides an extra 2300 Ibf of thrust at a propellant flow rate of\nabout 3.3 Ibm/sec. These booster engines are dropped from the vehicle after about 145\nsec operation. The central sustainer rocket engine, which also starts at liftoff, continues\nto operate for 300 sec. It has a sea-level thrust of 57{,}000 Ibf at a mass flow of 27.05\nIbm/sec. Its turbine exhaust gases are aspirated into the nozzle of the engine.

TYPICAL PERFORMANCE VALUES\nTypical values of representative performance parameters for different types of\nrocket propulsion are given in Table 2\u20141 and in Fig. 2\u20145.\n\nChemical rockets have relatively low values of specific impulse, relatively light\nmachinery (i.e., low engine weight), a very high thrust capability, and therefore\nhigh acceleration and high specific power. At the other extreme, the ion propul-\nsion devices have a very high specific impulse, but they must carry a heavy\nelectrical power source with them to deliver the power necessary for high ejec-\ntion velocities. The very low acceleration potential for the electrical propulsion\nunits and those using solar radiation energy usually requires a long period for\naccelerating and thus these systems are best used for missions where the flight\ntime is long. The low thrust values of electrical systems imply that they are not\nuseful in fields of strong gravitational gradients (for takeoff or landing) but are\nbest used in a true space flight mission.\n\nThe chemical systems (solid and liquid propellant rockets) are fully developed\nand widely used for many different vehicle applications. They are described in\nChapters 5 to 16. Electrical propulsion has been in operation in many space\nflight applications (see Chapter 17). Some of the other types are still in their\nexploratory or development phase, but may become useful.\n\nExample 2-4.

They\nare useful as a means of evaluating and comparing the performance of various\nrocket systems; they permit the prediction of the operating performance of any\nrocket unit that uses the thermodynamic expansion of a gas and the determination\nof several necessary design parameters, such as nozzle size and generic shape,\nfor any given performance requirement. This theory applies to chemical rocket\npropulsion systems (both liquid and solid and hybrid propellant types), nuclear\nrockets, solar-heated and resistance or arc-heated electrical rocket systems, and\nto any propulsion system that uses the expansion of a gas as the propulsive\nmechanism for ejecting matter at high velocity.\n\nThese thermodynamic relations, which are fundamental and important in anal-\nysis and design of rocket units, are introduced and explained in this chapter. The\nutilization of these equations should give the reader a basic understanding of\nthe thermodynamic processes involved in rocket gas behavior and expansion. A\nknowledge of elementary thermodynamics and fluid mechanics on the part of the\nreader is assumed (see Refs. 3\u20141, 3\u20142, and 3-3). This chapter also addresses\ndifferent nozzle configurations, nonoptimum performance, energy losses, noz-\nzle alignment, variable thrust, and four different ways for establishing nozzle\nperformance parameters.\n\n47\n",

IDEAL ROCKET\n\nThe concept of ideal rocket propulsion systems is useful because the relevant\nbasic thermodynamic principles can be expressed as simple mathematical rela-\ntionships, which are given in subsequent sections of this chapter. These equations\ntheoretically describe a quasi-one-dimensional nozzle flow, which corresponds to\nan idealization and simplification of the full two- or three-dimensional equations\nand the real aerothermochemical behavior. However, with the assumptions and\nsimplifications stated below, they are very adequate for obtaining useful solutions\nto many rocket propulsion systems and preliminary design tasks. For chemical\nrocket propulsion the measured actual performance is usually between | and\n6% below the calculated ideal value. In designing new rockets, it has become\naccepted practice to use ideal rocket parameters that can then be modified by\nappropriate corrections, such as those discussed in Section 3.5. An ideal rocket\nunit is one for which the following assumptions are valid:\n\n1. The working substance (or chemical reaction products) is homogeneous.\n\n2. All the species of the working fluid are gaseous. Any condensed phases\n(liquid or solid) add a negligible amount to the total mass.\n\n3. The working substance obeys the perfect gas law.\n\n4. There is no heat transfer across the rocket walls; therefore, the flow is\nadiabatic.\n\n5. There is no appreciable friction and all boundary layer effects are\nneglected.\n\n6. There are no shock waves or discontinuities in the nozzle flow.\n\n7. The propellant flow is steady and constant. The expansion of the working\nfluid is uniform and steady, without vibration. Transient effects (i.e., start-\nup and shutdown) are of very short duration and may be neglected.\n\n8. All exhaust gases leaving the rocket have an axially directed velocity.\n\n9. The gas velocity, pressure, temperature, and density are all uniform across\nany section normal to the nozzle axis.\n\n10. Chemical equilibrium is established within the rocket chamber and the gas\ncomposition does not change in the nozzle (frozen flow).\n11. Stored propellants are at room temperature. Cryogenic propellants are at\ntheir boiling points.\nThese assumptions permit the derivation of a simple, quasi-one-dimensional\ntheory as mentioned in subsequent sections. Later in this book we present more\nsophisticated theories or introduce correction factors for several of the items on\nthe list, and they allow a more accurate determination of the simplified analysis.\nThe next paragraph explains why these assumptions cause only small errors.\nFor a liquid bipropellant rocket the idealized theory postulates an injection\nsystem in which the fuel and oxidizer are mixed perfectly so that a homogeneous\nworking substance results. A good rocket injector can approach this condition\n",

For nuclear,\nsolar-heated or arc-heated rockets, it is assumed that the hot gases are uniform\nin temperature at any cross section and steady in flow. Because chamber tem-\nperatures are typically high (2500 to 3600 K for common propellants), all gases\nare well above their respective saturation conditions and actually follow the per-\nfect gas law very closely. Assumptions 4, 5, and 6 above allow the use of the\nisentropic expansion relations in the rocket nozzle, thereby describing the max-\nimum conversion of heat to kinetic energy of the jet. This also implies that the\nnozzle flow is thermodynamically reversible. Wall friction losses are difficult to\ndetermine accurately, but they are usually negligible in nozzles. Except for very\nsmall chambers, the energy lost as heat to the walls of the rocket is usually less\nthan 1% (occasionally up to 2%) of the total energy and can therefore often be\nneglected. Short-term fluctuations of the steady propellant flow rate and pressure\nare usually less than 5% of the rated value; their effect on rocket performance\nis small and can be neglected. In well-designed supersonic nozzles, the conver-\nsion of thermal energy into directed kinetic energy of the exhaust gases proceeds\nsmoothly and without normal shocks or discontinuities; thus the flow expansion\nlosses are generally small.\n\nSome companies and some authors do not include all or the same 11 items\nlisted above in their definition of an ideal rocket. For example, instead of assump-\ntion 8 (all nozzle exit velocity is axially directed), some use a conical exit nozzle\nwith a 15\u00b0 half-angle as their base configuration in their ideal nozzle; this dis-\ncounts the divergence losses, which are described later in this chapter.\n\n3.2. SUMMARY OF THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONS\n\nIn this section we review briefly some of the basic relationships needed for the\ndevelopment of the nozzle flow equations. Rigorous derivations and discussions\nof these relations can be found in many thermodynamics or fluid dynamics texts,\nsuch as Refs. 3\u20141 and 3-2.\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy can be readily applied to the adiabatic,\nno shaft-work process inside the nozzle. Furthermore, without shocks or friction,\nthe flow entropy change is zero. The concept of enthalpy is useful in flow systems;\nthe enthalpy comprises the internal thermal energy plus the flow work (or work\nperformed by the gas at a velocity v in crossing a boundary). For ideal gases\nthe enthalpy can conveniently be expressed as the product of the specific heat cp\ntimes the absolute temperature T (the specific heat at constant pressure is formally\ndefined as the partial derivative of the enthalpy with respect to temperature at\nconstant pressure). Under the above assumptions, the total or stagnation enthalpy\nper unit mass /o is constant, that is,\n\nho = h + v?/2J = constant 3-1)\n",

In SI units (kg, m, sec) the value of J is one. In the\nEE system of units the value of the constant J is given in Appendix 1.

As can be seen from Eq. 3-1 the stagnation\nenthalpy consists of the sum of the static or local enthalpy and the fluid kinetic\nenergy. The stagnation temperature Ty is found from the energy equation as\nTy =T + v7/(2cpJ) (3-8)\nwhere T is the absolute fluid static temperature. In adiabatic flows, the stagnation\ntemperature remains constant. The relationship of the stagnation pressure to the\nlocal pressure in the flow can be found from the previous two equations:\npo/p = (1+ v?/cpIT? = (V/Voy (3-9)\nWhen the local velocity comes close to zero, the local temperature and pressure\nwill approach the stagnation pressure and stagnation temperature.

Since this would\nlead quickly to a local overheating and failure of the wall, nozzle inner walls\nhave to be smooth without any protrusion. Stagnation conditions can also occur\nat the leading edge of a jet vane (described in Chapter 18) or at the tip of a gas\nsampling tube inserted into the flow.\nVelocity\nFrom Eq. 3-2 the nozzle exit velocity v2 can be found:\nv2 = /2J (hy \u2014 hg) + v?

The influences of the pressure ratio\nacross the nozzle p;/p2 and of the specific heat ratio k are less pronounced. As\ncan be seen from Fig. 3\u20142, performance increases with an increase of the pressure\nratio; this ratio increases when the value of the chamber pressure p; increases\nor when the exit pressure p2 decreases, corresponding to high altitude designs.\nThe small influence of k values is fortuitous because low molecular masses are\nfound in diatomic or monatomic gases, which have the higher values of k.\n\nFor comparing specific impulse values from one rocket system to another or\nfor evaluating the influence of various design parameters, the value of the pressure\nratio must be standardized.

Very high\ngas velocities (over 1 km/sec) can be obtained in rocket nozzles. The temperature\ndrop of the combustion gases flowing through a rocket nozzle is appreciable. In\nthe example given the temperature changed 1115\u00b0C in a relatively short distance.\nThis should not be surprising, for the increase in the kinetic energy of the gases is\nderived from a decrease of the enthalpy, which in turn is roughly proportional to\nthe decrease in temperature. Because the exhaust gases are still very hot (1107 K)\nwhen leaving the nozzle, they contain considerable thermal energy not available\nfor conversion into kinetic energy of the jet.\n\nNozzle Flow and Throat Condition\n\nThe required nozzle area decreases to a minimum (at 1.130 MPa or 164 psi pres-\nsure in the previous example) and then increases again. Nozzles of this type (often\ncalled De Laval nozzles after their inventor) consist of a convergent section fol-\nlowed by a divergent section. From the continuity equation, the area is inversely\nproportional to the ratio v/V. This quantity has also been plotted in Fig. 3-3.\nThere is a maximum in the curve of v/V because at first the velocity increases\n",

This pressure ratio is found by setting M = | in Eq. 3-13:\npe/pr = [2/(k + DIED (3-20)\nThe throat pressure p; for which the isentropic mass flow rate is a maximum\nis called the critical pressure. Typical values of this critical pressure ratio range\nbetween 0.53 and 0.57 of the inlet pressure. The flow through a specified rocket\nnozzle with a given inlet condition is less than the maximum if the pressure\nratio is larger than that given by Eq. 3-20. However, note that this ratio is not\nthat across the entire nozzle and that the maximum flow or choking condition\n(explained below) is always established internally at the throat and not at the\nexit plane. The nozzle inlet pressure is very close to the chamber stagnation\npressure, except in narrow combustion chambers where there is an appreciable\ndrop in pressure from the injector region to the nozzle entrance region. This is\ndiscussed in Section 3.5. At the point of critical pressure, namely the throat, the\nMach number is one and the values of the specific volume and temperature can\nbe obtained from Eqs. 3\u20147 and 3-12:\nV, = Vile + 1/2]'/4-?

At the\ncritical point there is only a mild change of these properties. Take, for example,\na gas with k = 1.2; the critical pressure ratio is about 0.56 (which means that p;\nequals almost half of the chamber pressure p;; the temperature drops only slightly\n(T, =0.91T|), and the specific volume expands by over 60% (V; = 1.61V}).\nFrom Eqs. 3-15, 3\u201420, and 3-22, the critical or throat velocity v, is obtained:\n| 2k\nvp = 5 \u2014\u2014RT, = a; = VKRT, (3-23)\nk+1\nThe first version of this equation permits the throat velocity to be calculated\ndirectly from the nozzle inlet conditions without any of the throat conditions\nbeing known. At the nozzle throat the critical velocity is clearly also the sonic\nvelocity. The flow in the chamber is subsonic and downstream of the nozzle throat\nit is supersonic. The divergent portion of the nozzle permits further decreases in\npressure and increases in velocity under supersonic conditions. If the nozzle is cut\noff at the throat section, the exit gas velocity is sonic and the flow rate remains\na maximum. The sonic and supersonic flow condition can be attained only if the\ncritical pressure prevails at the throat, that is, if p2/p; is equal to or less than\nthe quantity defined by Eq. 3\u201420. There are, therefore, three different types of\nnozzles: subsonic, sonic, and supersonic, and these are described in Table 3-1.\n",

It achieves a high degree\nof conversion of enthalpy to kinetic energy. The ratio between the inlet and exit\npressures in all rockets is sufficiently large to induce supersonic flow. Only if\nthe absolute chamber pressure drops below approximately 1.78 atm will there be\nsubsonic flow in the divergent portion of the nozzle during sea-level operation.\nThis condition occurs for a very short time during the start and stop transients.\n\nThe velocity of sound is equal to the propagation speed of an elastic pres-\nsure wave within the medium, sound being an infinitesimal pressure wave. If,\ntherefore, sonic velocity is reached at any point within a steady flow system, it is\nimpossible for a pressure disturbance to travel past the location of sonic or super-\nsonic flow. Thus, any partial obstruction or disturbance of the flow downstream\nof the nozzle throat with sonic flow has no influence on the throat or upstream\nof it, provided that the disturbance does not raise the downstream pressure above\nits critical value. It is not possible to increase the throat velocity or the flow\nrate in the nozzle by further lowering the exit pressure or even evacuating the\nexhaust section. This important condition is often described as choking the flow.\nIt is always established at the throat and not the nozzle exit plane.

For high-altitude (100 km or higher) area ratios are typically between\n40 and 200, but there have been some as high as 400.

When py = p2, Eq. 3-26\ndescribes the velocity ratio between the nozzle exit area and the throat section.\nWhen the exit pressure coincides with the atmospheric pressure (p2 = p3, see\nFig. 2-1), these equations apply for optimum nozzle expansion. For rockets\nthat operate at high altitudes, not too much additional exhaust velocity can be\ngained by increasing the area ratio above 1000. In addition, design difficulties\nand a heavy inert nozzle mass make applications above area ratios of about 350\nmarginal.\n\nAppendix 2 is a table of several properties of the earth\u2019s atmosphere with\nagreed-upon standard values. It gives ambient pressure for different altitudes.\nThese properties can vary somewhat from day to day (primarily because of solar\nactivity) and between hemispheres. For example, the density of the atmosphere\nat altitudes between 200 and 3000 km can change by more than an order of\nmagnitude, affecting satellite drag.\n\nExample 3-3.

Using values from Appendix 2\nand solving Eq. 3-25 for p2/p3 = 0.0198(p2 = 0.396 atm),\nSea level: p1/p3 = 20/1.0 = 20 Cr = 1.33\n10 km altitude: p1/p3 = 20/0.26151 = 76.5 Cr = 1.56\n\nThrust increase = (1.56 \u2014 1.33)/1.33 = 17.3%\nNote that performance at optimum nozzle expansion (p2 = p3) this nozzle delivers a\nthrust that is somewhat less than the maximum. From Fig. 3-6 we find that for \u00ab = 6\nthe optimum Cr = 1.52, which corresponds to 7.2 km elevation, whereas the maximum\nvalue is Cr = 1.63 in a vacuum. The thrust coefficient could be somewhat higher for\nlarger area ratios.\nUnder- and Over-Expanded Nozzles\nAn under-expanded nozzle discharges the fluid at an exit pressure greater than\nthe external pressure because the exit area is too small for an optimum area ratio.\nThe expansion of the fluid is therefore incomplete within the nozzle, and further\nexpansion will take place outside of the nozzle exit. The nozzle exit pressure is\nhigher than the local atmospheric pressure.\n\nIn an over-expanded nozzle the fluid exists at lower pressure than the\natmosphere as it has an exit area too large for optimum. The phenomenon of\nover-expansion for a supersonic nozzle is shown in Fig. 3\u20149, with typical\npressure measurements of superheated steam along the nozzle axis and different\nback pressures or pressure ratios. Curve AB shows the variation of pressure\nwith the optimum back pressure corresponding to the nozzle area ratio. Curves\nAC and AD show the variation of pressure along the axis for increasingly\nhigher external pressures. The expansion within the nozzle proceeds normally\nfor the initial portion of the nozzle. At point J on curve AD, for example, the\npressure is lower than the exit pressure and a sudden rise in pressure takes place\nthat is accompanied by the separation of the flow from the walls (separation is\ndescribed later).\n\nThe nonideal behavior of nozzles is strongly influenced by the presence of\ncompression waves or shock waves inside the diverging nozzle section, which are\nstrong compression discontinuities and exist only in supersonic flow. The sudden\npressure rise in the curve JD is such a compression wave. Expansion waves, also\nstrictly supersonic phenomena, match the flow from a nozzle exit to lower ambi-\nent pressures. Compression and expansion waves are described in Chapter 20.\n\nThe different possible flow conditions in a supersonic nozzle are as follows:\n\n1. When the external pressure p3 is below the nozzle exit pressure p2, the\n\nnozzle will flow full but will have external expansion waves at its exit (i.e.,\n",

For higher external pressures, separation of the flow will begin to take place\ninside the divergent portion of the nozzle. The diameter of the supersonic jet\nwill be smaller than the nozzle exit diameter. With steady flow, separation\nis typically axially symmetric. Figures 3-10 and 3-11 show diagrams of\nseparated flows. The axial location of the separation plane depends on\nthe local pressure and the wall contour. The point of separation travels\ndownstream with decreasing external pressure.

Simplified sketches of exhaust gas behavior of three typical rocket noz-\nzles for a three-stage launch vehicle. The first vehicle stage has the biggest chamber and\nthe highest thrust but the lowest nozzle area ratio, and the top or third stage usually has\nthe lower thrust but the highest nozzle area ratio.\n(before the chamber pressure reaches its full value), some momentary flow oscil-\nlations and nonsymmetric separation of the jet can occur during over-expanded\nflow operation. The magnitude and direction of transient side forces can change\nrapidly and erratically. The resulting side forces can be large and have caused\nfailures of nozzle exit cone structures and thrust vector control gimbal actua-\ntors. References 3\u20144, 3\u20145, and 3-6 discuss techniques for estimating these side\nforces.\n\nWhen the flow separates, as it does in a highly over-expanded nozzle, the\nthrust coefficient Cr can be estimated if the point of separation in the nozzle is\nknown. Thus, Cr can be determined for an equivalent smaller nozzle with an\nexit area equal to that at the point of separation. The effect of separation is to\nincrease the thrust and the thrust coefficient over the value that they would have\nif separation had not occurred. Thus, with separated gas flow, a nozzle designed\nfor high altitude (large value of \u20ac) would have a larger thrust at sea level than\nexpected, but not as good as an optimum nozzle; in this case separation may\nactually be desirable. With separated flow a large and usually heavy portion of\nthe nozzle is not utilized and the nozzle is bulkier and longer than necessary. The\nadded engine weight and size decrease flight performance. Designers therefore\nselect an area ratio that will not cause separation.\n",
    "90": "3.3. ISENTROPIC FLOW THROUGH NOZZLES 73\n\nBecause of uneven flow separation and potentially destructive side loads, sea-\nlevel static tests of an upper stage or a space propulsion system with a high area\nratio over-expanded nozzle are usually avoided; instead, a sea-level test nozzle\nwith a much smaller area ratio is substituted. However, actual and simulated alti-\ntude testing (in an altitude test facility similar to the one described in Chapter 21)\nwould be done with a nozzle having the correct large area ratio. The ideal solu-\ntion that avoids separation at low altitudes and has high values of Cr at high\naltitudes is a nozzle that changes area ratio in flight. This is discussed at the end\nof this section.\n\nFor most applications, the rocket system has to operate over a range of alti-\n\ntudes; for a fixed chamber pressure this implies a range of nozzle pressure ratios.\nThe condition of optimum expansion (p2 = p3) occurs only at one altitude, and\na nozzle with a fixed area ratio is therefore operating much of the time at either\nover-expanded or under-expanded conditions. The best nozzle for such an appli-\ncation is not necessarily one that gives optimum nozzle gas expansion, but one\nthat gives the largest vehicle flight performance (say, total impulse, or specific\nimpulse, or range, or payload); it can often be related to a time average over the\npowered flight trajectory.\nExample 3-5. Use the data from Example 3-4 (p; = 20 atm, k = 1.30) and consider\nboth the area ratio \u20ac = 6.0 and \u20ac = 15.0. Compare the performance of these two nozzles\nas a function of altitude by plotting Cr up to 50 km. Assume no shocks inside the nozzle.\nSOLUTION. The procedures are the same as those in Example 3-4 and the resulting\nplot is shown in Fig. 3-10. The values of Cr can be obtained by following vertical lines\nfor \u20ac = 6.0 and 15.0 in Fig. 3-8 corresponding to different pressure ratios at increasing\naltitudes. Alternatively, Eq. 3-30 may be used for greater accuracy. The lower area ratio\ngives a better performance at the lower altitudes but above about 10 km the larger area\nratio gives a higher Cr. Also noted in Fig. 3\u201410 by the dotted line is what a continuously\nvariable nozzle area ratio could accomplish by matching p2 to p3 at all altitudes.\n\nThe optimum pressure ratio always occurs when p;/p3 = p1/p2 and for the e = 15.0\ncase, from Fig. 3-6 or 3-8, this value is about 180; p3 = 20/180 = 0.111 atm, which\ncorresponds to about 15.5 km altitude. Below this altitude the nozzle is over-expanded.\nAt sea level, where p;/p3 = 20, separation could occur as indicated in Fig. 3-8. For\nsimilarly shaped nozzles, it is estimated that sea-level separation begins to take place at\na cross section where the local pressure is between 10 and 40% of p3 or below 0.4 atm.\nUpon separation, this nozzle would not flow full downstream of an area ratio of about 6\nor 7 and the gas jet would occupy only the central portion of the nozzle exit. See Figs.\n3-10 and 3\u201411. Weak shock waves and jet contraction would then raise the exhaust jet\u2019s\npressure to match the value of the surrounding atmosphere. If the jet does not separate,\nit would reach an exit pressure of 0.11 atm, but this is often an unstable condition. As\nthe vehicle gains altitude, the separation plane would gradually move downstream until,\nat an altitude of about 700 m, the exhaust gases would occupy the full diverging section\nof the nozzle area.\n\nThe values of Cr can be obtained by following a vertical line for \u20ac = 15 and \u00ab =6\nin Fig. 3\u20148 for different pressure ratios, which correspond to different altitudes. Alterna-\ntively, Eq. 3-30 can be used for better accuracy. Results are similar to those plotted in\nFig. 3-10. The lower area ratio of 6 gives a higher Cr at low altitudes but is inferior to\n",

A nozzle area ratio larger than 15 would yield\na higher Cr at the higher altitudes.\n\nFigure 3-11 shows a comparison of altitude and sea-level behavior of three\nnozzles and their plumes at different area ratios for a typical three-stage satellite\nlaunch vehicle. When fired at sea-level conditions, the nozzle of the third stage\nwith the highest area ratio will experience flow separation and suffer a major\nperformance loss; the second stage will flow full but the external plume will\ncontract; since p2 < p3, there is a loss in J, and F\u2019. There is no effect on the first\nstage nozzle.\n\nExample 3-6. A rocket engine test near sea level gives the following data: thrust F =\n53,000 Ibf, propellant mass flow rate ri = 208 Ibm/sec, nozzle exit area ratio A2/A; =\n10.0, actual local atmospheric pressure at test station p3 = 13.8 psia, and chamber pressure\nPi = 620 psia. The test engineer also knows that for the same flow rate (and mixture\nratio) the theoretical specific impulse is 289 sec at the standard reference conditions of\npi = 1000 psia and p3 = 14.7 psia, and that k = 1.20. For many propellants we may\nassume that the combustion temperature and & do not vary significantly with chamber\npressure. Compare the test performance of this rocket with its equivalent at sea level,\nstandard, and vacuum performance.\n\nSOLUTION. The pressure ratio for the test condition is 620/13.8 = 44.93; if the test\nwould have been conducted at 14.7 psia, this pressure ratio would have been 620/14.7 =\n42.18; for the standard reference conditions the pressure ratio is 1000/14.7 = 68.03.\n\nSince this nozzle is operating supersonically, we find, from Eqs. 2-5, 3-24, and\n3-31, that specific impulse ratios depend only on ratios of the thrust coefficient, that is,\nUs)b = Us)al(Cr)b/(Cr)a]. From Fig. 3\u20147 or from Eq. 3-30 one obtains Cr = 1.48 for\nthe test condition with \u00ab = 10,k = 1.20, and p;/p3 = 44.9. The corresponding specific\nimpulse is, from Eq. 2\u20145, J; = 53000/208 = 255 sec.\n\nThe following table shows all the results:\n\nTest Test for Standard Vacuum\n\nResults Sea Level Condition Condition\nP\\ (psia) 620 620 1,000 620\nP3 (psia) 13.8 14.7 14.7 0\nP1/P3 44.93 42.18 68.03 oo\nF (Ibf) 53,000 52,494 55,744 60,741\nIs (sec) 255 252 268 292\nCr 1.52 1.50 1.60 1.74\n\nFigures 3-10 and 3-11 suggest that an ideal design for an ascending (e.g.,\nlaunch) rocket vehicle would have a \u201crubber-like\u201d diverging section that could be\nlengthened and enlarged so that the nozzle exit area could be made larger as the\nambient pressure is reduced.

They are discussed in the\nnext section.\nInfluence of Chamber Geometry\nWhen the chamber has a cross section that is larger than about four times the\nthroat area (A, /A; > 4), the chamber velocity v;, can be neglected, as was men-\ntioned in explaining Eqs. 3-15 and 3-16. However, vehicle space or weight\nconstraints often require smaller thrust chamber areas for liquid propellant engines\nand grain design considerations lead to small void volumes or small perforations\nor port areas for solid propellant motors. Then v; can no longer be neglected as\na contribution to the performance. The gases in the chamber expand as heat is\nbeing added. The energy necessary to accelerate these expanding gases within\nthe chamber will also cause a pressure drop and an additional energy loss. This\nacceleration process in the chamber is adiabatic (no heat transfer) but not isen-\ntropic. This loss is a maximum when the chamber diameter is equal to the nozzle\ndiameter, which means that there is no converging nozzle section. This has been\ncalled a throatless rocket motor and has been used in a few tactical missile booster\napplications, where there was a premium on minimum inert mass and length. The\nflight performance improvement due to inert mass savings supposedly outweighs\nthe nozzle performance loss of a throatless motor. Table 3-2 lists some of the\nperformance penalties for three chamber area ratios.\n\nBecause of this pressure drop within narrow chambers, the chamber pressure\nis lower at the nozzle entrance than it would be if A;/A; had been larger. This\ncauses a small loss in thrust and specific impulse. The theory of this loss is given\nin Ref. 3-7 and some results are listed in Table 3\u20142.\n\n3.4.

Nozzles and\nchambers are usually of circular cross section and have a converging section, a\nthroat at the narrowest location (minimum cross section), and a diverging section.\nNozzles can be seen in Figs. 1-4, 1-5, 1-8, 2-1, 3-11, 3-12, 3-14, 11-1,\n12-1 to 12-3, and 15-6 to 15-8. Refs. 3-4 and 3-8 describe many nozzle\nconfigurations.\n\nThe converging nozzle section between the chamber and the nozzle throat\nhas never been critical in achieving high performance. The subsonic flow in this\nsection can easily be turned at very low pressure drop and any radius, cone angle,\nwall contour curve, or nozzle inlet shape is usually satisfactory. A few small\nattitude control thrust chambers have had their nozzle at 90\u00b0 from the combustion\nchamber axis without any performance loss. The throat contour also is not very\ncritical to performance, and any radius or other curve is usually acceptable. The\npressure gradients are high in these two regions and the flow will adhere to the\nwalls. The principal difference in the different nozzle configurations is found\nin the diverging supersonic-flow section, as described below. The wall surface\nthroughout the nozzle should be smooth and shiny to minimize friction, radiation\nabsorption, and convective heat transfer due to surface roughness. Gaps, holes,\nsharp edges, or protrusions must be avoided.\n\nSix different nozzle configurations are shown in Fig. 3-12 and each will be\ndiscussed. The first three sketches show conical and bell-shaped nozzles. The\nother three have a center body inside the nozzle and have excellent altitude com-\npensation. Although these last three have been ground tested, to date none of\nthem has flown in a production space launch vehicle. The lengths of several\nnozzle types are compared in Fig. 3-13. The objectives of a good nozzle con-\nfiguration are to obtain the highest practical /,, minimize inert nozzle mass, and\nconserve length (shorter nozzles can reduce vehicle length, vehicle structure, and\nvehicle inert mass).\n\nCone- and Bell-Shaped Nozzles\nThe conical nozzle is the oldest and perhaps the simplest configuration. It is\nrelatively easy to fabricate and is still used today in many small nozzles. A\ntheoretical correction factor A can be applied to the nozzle exit momentum of\nan ideal rocket with a conical nozzle exhaust. This factor is the ratio between\nthe momentum of the gases in a nozzle with a finite nozzle angle 2a and the\nmomentum of an ideal nozzle with all gases flowing in an axial direction:\n\n4 = 4(1 + cosa) (3-34)\nThe variation of 4 with different values of a is shown in Table 3-3 for any\nnozzle that has uniform mass flow per unit exit area. For ideal rockets A = 1.0.\nFor a rocket nozzle with a divergence cone angle of 30\u00b0 (half angle a = 15\u00b0), the\nexit momentum and therefore the exhaust velocity will be 98.3% of the velocity\ncalculated by Eq. 3\u201415b.

NOZZLE CONFIGURATIONS 79\ndivergence angle gives short, lightweight designs, but the performance is low.\nThere is an optimum conical nozzle shape and length (typically between 12 and\n18\u00b0 half angle) and it is usually a compromise which depends on the specific\napplication and flight path.\n\nThe bell-shaped or contour nozzle (see Figs. 3-12 and 3-13) is probably the\nmost common nozzle shape today. It has a high angle expansion section (20 to\n50\u00b0) right downstream of the nozzle throat; this is followed by a gradual reversal\nof nozzle contour slope so that at the nozzle exit the divergence angle is small,\nusually less than a 10\u00b0 half angle. It is possible to go to large divergence angles\nimmediately behind the throat (20 to 50\u00b0) because the high relative pressure, the\nlarge pressure gradient, and the rapid expansion of the working fluid do not allow\nseparation in this region unless there are discontinuities in the nozzle contour.\nThe expansion in the supersonic bell nozzle is more efficient than in a simple\nstraight cone of similar area ratio and length, because the wall contour is designed\nto minimize losses, as explained later in this section. For the past several decades\nmost of the nozzles have been bell shaped.\n\nA change of flow direction of a supersonic gas in an expanding wall geometry\ncan only be achieved through expansion waves. An expansion wave occurs at a\nthin surface within the flow, where the flow velocity increases and changes its\nflow direction slightly, and where the pressure and temperature drop. These wave\nsurfaces are at an oblique angle to the flow. As the gas passes through the throat,\nit undergoes a series of these expansion waves with essentially no loss of energy.\nIn the bell-shaped nozzle shown in Fig. 3\u201414 these expansions occur internally\nin the flow between the throat and the inflection location /; the area is steadily\nincreasing like a flare on a trumpet. The contour angle 6; is a maximum at the\ninflection location. Between the inflection point J and the nozzle exit E the flow\narea is still increasing, but at a diminishing rate, allowing further gas expansion\nand additional expansion waves. However, the contour of the nozzle wall is\ndifferent and the change in cross-sectional area per unit length is decreasing. The\npurpose of this last segment of the contoured nozzle is to have a low divergence\nloss as the gas leaves the nozzle exit plane. The angle at the exit 6, is small,\nusually less than 10\u00b0. The difference between 6; and 6, is called the turn-back\nangle. When the gas flow is turned in the opposite direction (between points\nI and E) oblique compression waves will occur. These compression waves are\nthin surfaces where the flow undergoes a mild shock, the flow is turned, and the\nvelocity is actually reduced slightly.

An 80% bell nozzle has a length\n(distance between throat plane and exit plane) that is 20% shorter than a compa-\nrable 15\u00b0 cone of the same area ratio. Ref. 3-9 shows the original presentation\nby Rao of the method of characteristics applied to shorter bell nozzles. He also\ndetermined that a parabola was a good approximation for the bell-shaped con-\ntour curve (Ref. 3-3, Section 20.33), and parabolas have actually been used in\nsome nozzle designs. The top part of Fig. 3-14 shows that the parabola is tan-\ngent (6;) at the inflection point J and has an exit angle (6,) at point E and a\nlength L that has to be corrected for the curve 77. These conditions allow the\nparabola to be determined by simple geometric analysis or geometric drawing.\nA throat approach radius of 1.57, and a throat expansion radius of 0.47, were\nused. If somewhat different radii had been used, the results would have been only\nslightly different.

The bottom set of curves gives the\ncorrection factors, equivalent to the A factor for conical nozzles, which are to be\napplied to the thrust coefficient or the exhaust velocity, provided the nozzles are\nat optimum expansions, that is, p2 = p3.\n\nTable 3\u20144 shows data for parabolas developed from this figure, which allow\nthe reader to apply this method and check the results. The table shows two\nshortened bell nozzles and a conical nozzle, each for three area ratios. It can be\nseen that as the length has been decreased, the losses are higher for the shorter\nlength and slightly higher for small nozzle area ratios. A 1% improvement in\nthe correction factor gives about 1% more specific impulse (or thrust) and this\ndifference can be significant in many applications. The reduced length is an\nTABLE 3-4.

The table and Fig. 3-14 show that bell nozzles (75 to 85% length)\nare just as efficient as or slightly more efficient than a longer 15\u00b0 conical nozzle\n(100% length) at the same area ratio. For shorter nozzles (below 70% equivalent\nlength) the energy losses due to internal oblique shock waves become substantial\nand such short nozzles are not commonly used today.\n\nFor solid propellant rocket motor exhausts with small solid particles in the gas\n(usually aluminum oxide), and for exhausts of certain gelled liquid propellants,\nthere is an impingement of these solid particles against the nozzle wall in the\nreversing curvature section between J and E in Fig. 3-14. While the gas can be\nturned by oblique waves to have less divergence, the particles (particularly the\nlarger particles) have a tendency to move in straight lines and hit the walls at high\nvelocity. The resulting abrasion and erosion of the nozzle wall can be severe,\nespecially with the ablative and graphite materials that are commonly used. This\nabrasion by hot particles increases with turn-back angle. If the turn-back angle and\nthus also the inflection angle 6; are reduced, the erosion can become acceptable.\nTypical solid rocket motors flying today have values of inflection angles between\n20 and 26\u00b0 and turn-back angles of 10 to 15\u00b0. In comparison, current liquid rocket\nengines without entrained particles have inflection angles between 27 and 50\u00b0 and\nturn-back angles of between 15 and 30\u00b0. Therefore the performance enhancement\ncaused by using a bell-shaped nozzle (high value of correction factor) is somewhat\nlower in solid rocket motors with solid particles in the exhaust.\n\nThe ideal bell-shaped nozzle (minimum loss) is long, equivalent to a conical\n\nnozzle of perhaps 10 to 12\u00b0, as seen in Fig. 3-12. It has about the same length\nas a full-length aerospike nozzle. This is usually too long for reasonable vehicle\nmass ratios.\nTwo-Step Nozzles. A two-position nozzle (with different expansion area\nratios) can give a better performance than a conventional nozzle with a fixed\nsingle area ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 3-10; the lower area ratio nozzle\n(\u20ac = 6.0) performs best at low altitudes and the higher area ratio nozzle performs\nbest at higher altitudes. If these two nozzles could somehow be mechanically\ncombined, the resulting two-position nozzle would perform closer to an ideal\nnozzle which adjusts continuously to the optimum area ratio, as shown by the\nthin dashed curve. When integrated over the flight time, the extra performance\ncan be noticeable and it has a pay-off for high-velocity missions, such as\nearth-orbit injection and deep space missions. Several concepts of a bell-shaped\nnozzle have evolved that achieve maximum performance at more than a single\naltitude. Figure 3-15 shows three concepts for a two-step nozzle, one that\nhas an initial low area ratio A2/A; for operation at or near the earth\u2019s surface\nand a larger second area ratio that improves performance at high altitudes.

The key concerns are a reliable rugged mechanism to move the\nextension into position, the hot gas seal between the nozzle sections, and the\nextra weight involved. Its principal merit is the short length of the nozzle while\nstored. This reduces the length of the vehicle and a considerable part of the inert\nvehicle mass.

To date there has been little flight experience with this concept.\nNozzles with Aerodynamic Boundaries\n\nThese nozzles allow for nearly optimum nozzle expansion at all altitudes. The\nthree nozzles shown on the right side of Fig. 3-12 offer full altitude compensa-\ntion and are discussed next. Refs. 3\u20144 and 3-8 give more information. Altitude\ncompensation means that the nozzle allows nearly optimum performance at every\naltitude. Complete rocket engines with either a cut-off plug nozzle or an expan-\nsion/deflection nozzle have been developed and have been ground tested. Tests\nwith both pressurized feed systems and turbopump feed systems have been suc-\ncessful. However, as of 2008, none of these rocket engines with aerodynamic\nnozzle boundaries have flown in a production vehicle.\n\nThe plug nozzle or aerospike nozzle has an annular doughnut-shaped cham-\nber with an annular nozzle slot. Annular nozzle throats may cause combustion\nproblems. An alternate practical version has a number of individual small cham-\nbers (each with low area ratio short nozzles, a round throat, and a rectangular\nexit) arranged in a circle around a common plug or spike; see Fig. 8-12. The\noutside aerodynamic boundary of the gas flow in the divergent section of the\nnozzle is the interface between the hot gas and the ambient air; there is no outer\nwall as in a conical or bell-shaped nozzle. As the external or ambient pressure is\nreduced during the ascending flight, this gas boundary expands outward, causes\na change in pressure distribution on the central spike, and allows an automatic\nand continuous altitude compensation. The aerospike contour with the minimum\nflow losses turns out to be very long, similar in length to an optimum bell nozzle\nas shown in Figs. 3\u201412 and 3-13. The mass flow per unit exit area is relatively\nuniform over the cross section and the divergence losses are minimal.\n\nIf the central plug is cut off or truncated and the wall contour is slightly\naltered, then the nozzle will be very short, as shown in Figs. 3-12, 3-13, and\n3-14. It will have some internal supersonic waves and will show a small but\nreal loss in thrust compared to a nozzle with a full length central spike. There is\na small performance loss due to shock waves generated by the impingement of\ngases from the adjacent small chambers. The pressure distribution and the heat\ntransfer intensity vary on the inner contoured spike wall surface and vary with\naltitude. Figure 8\u201412 shows a typical pressure distribution over the contoured\nspike surface at high and low altitudes.\n\nThe pressure in the recirculating trapped gas of the subsonic region below the\nbottom plate also exerts a thrust force. The losses caused by the cut-off spike\ncan be largely offset by injecting a small amount of the gas flow (about 1% of\ntotal flow) through this base plate into the recirculating region, thus enhancing\nthe back pressure on the base plate. The advantages of the truncated aerospike\nare short length (which helps to reduce the length and mass of the flight vehicle),\nfull altitude compensation, no flow separation from the wall at lower altitudes,\nand ease of vehicle/engine integration for certain vehicle configurations.\n",
    "102": "3.5. REALNOZZLES 85\n\nThe linear aerospike nozzle is a variation of the round axisymmetric aerospike\nnozzle. Basically, it is an unrolled version of the circular configuration. It is\nexplained further in Section 8.2.\n\nIn the expansion deflection nozzle (Fig. 3-12) the flow from the chamber\nis directed radially outward away from the nozzle axis. The flow is turned on\na curved contour outer diverging nozzle wall. The nozzle has been shortened\nand has some internal oblique shock wave losses. The hot gas flow leaving the\nchamber expands around a central plug. The aerodynamic interface between the\nambient air and gas flow forms an inner boundary of the gas flow in the diverging\nnozzle section. As the ambient pressure is reduced, the hot gas flow fills more\nand more of the nozzle diverging section. Altitude compensation is achieved by\nthis change in flow boundary and by changes in the pressure distribution on the\nouter walls. Actual ground tests with both liquid engines and solid motors have\nnot yet led to routine flight tests.\n\nMultiple Nozzles. If a single large nozzle is replaced by a cluster of smaller\nnozzles on a solid motor (with the same total thrust), then it is possible to reduce\nthe nozzle length. Similarly, if a single large thrust chamber of a liquid engine\nis replaced by several smaller thrust chambers, the nozzle length will be shorter,\nreducing the vehicle length and thus the vehicle structure and inert mass. Reaction\nMotors, Inc. (RMI), in their first aircraft-rocket engine, and the Soviets pioneered\na set of four thrust chambers, each with 25% of the total thrust, assembled next to\neach other and fed from the same liquid propellant feed system. This quadruple\nthrust chamber arrangement has been used effectively on many large Russian\nspace launch vehicles and missiles. As seen in Fig. 3-13, the nozzle length of\nthis cluster is about 30% shorter than a single nozzle of an equivalent larger thrust\nchamber. The vehicle diameter at the cluster nozzle exit is somewhat larger, the\nvehicle drag is higher, and there is additional engine complexity and often more\nengine mass.\n\n3.5. REAL NOZZLES\n\nThe assumptions and simplifications listed in Section 3.1 are only approxima-\ntions that allow relatively simple algorithms and simple mathematical solutions\nto the analysis of real rocket nozzle phenomena. For most of these assumptions\nit is possible either (1) to use an empirical correction factor (based on experi-\nmental data) or (2) to develop or use a more accurate algorithm, which involves\nmore detailed understanding and simulation of energy losses, the physical or\nchemical phenomena, and also often a more complex theoretical analysis and\nmathematical treatment. Some of these approaches are mentioned briefly in this\nsection.\n\nCompared to an ideal nozzle, the real nozzle has energy losses and energy that\nis unavailable for conversion into kinetic energy of the exhaust gas. The principal\nlosses are listed below and several of these are discussed in more detail.\n",
    "103": "86 = NOZZLE THEORY AND THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONS\n\n1. The divergence of the flow in the nozzle exit sections causes a loss, which\nvaries as a function of the cosine of the divergence angle as shown by\nEq. 3-34 and Table 3-3 for conical nozzles. The losses can be reduced\nfor bell-shaped nozzle contours.\n\n2. Small chamber or port area cross sections relative to the throat area or low\nnozzle contraction ratios A,/A; cause pressure losses in the chamber and\nreduce the thrust and exhaust velocity slightly. See Table 3-2.\n\n3. Lower flow velocity in the boundary layer or wall friction can reduce the\neffective exhaust velocity by 0.5 to 1.5%.\n\n4. Solid particles or liquid droplets in the gas can cause losses perhaps up to\n5%, as described below.\n\n5. Unsteady combustion and oscillating flow can account for a small loss.\n\n6. Chemical reactions in nozzle flow change gas composition and gas proper-\nties and gas temperatures, giving typically a 0.5% loss. See Chapter 5.\n\n7. There is lower pressure and lower performance during transient operation,\nfor example, during start, stop, or pulsing.\n\n8. For uncooled nozzle materials, such as fiber-reinforced plastics or carbon,\nthe gradual erosion of the throat region increases the throat diameter by\nperhaps | to 6% during operation. In turn this will reduce the chamber\npressure and thrust by about | to 6%. This enlargement of the throat area\ncauses a drop in chamber compression and a slight reduction in specific\nimpulse usually less than 0.7%.\n\n9. Nonuniform gas composition can reduce performance (due to incomplete\nmixing, turbulence, or incomplete combustion).\n\n10. Using real gas properties can at times change the gas composition, the\nvalues of k and St, and this can cause a small loss in performance, say 0.2\nto 0.7%.\n\n11. Operation at nonoptimum nozzle expansion area ratio reduces thrust and\nspecific impulse. There is no loss if the vehicle only flies at the altitude\nfor optimum nozzle expansion (p2 = p3). If it flies with a fixed nozzle area\nratio at higher or lower altitudes, then there is a loss (during a portion of the\nflight) by up to 15% in thrust compared to a nozzle with altitude compen-\nsation, as can be seen in Figs. 3\u20147 and 3-8.

    "105": "88 = NOZZLE THEORY AND THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONS\n\nMultiphase Flow\n\nIn some propulsion systems the gaseous working fluid contains small liquid\ndroplets and/or solid particles that must be accelerated by the gas. They give up\nheat to the gas during the expansion in a nozzle. This, for example, occurs with\nsolid propellants (see Chapter 13) or some gelled liquid propellants (Section 7.5),\nwhich contain aluminum powder that forms small oxide particles in the exhaust.\nIt can also occur with iron oxide catalysts, or propellants containing beryllium,\nboron, or zirconium.\n\nIn general, if the particles are very small (typically with diameters of 0.005\nmm or less), they will have almost the same velocity as the gas and will be in\nthermal equilibrium with the nozzle gas flow. Thus, as the gases give up kinetic\nenergy to accelerate the particles, they gain thermal energy from the particles.\nAs the particle diameters become larger, the mass (and thus the inertia) of the\nparticle increases as the cube of its diameter; however, the drag force increases\nonly as the square of the diameter. Larger particles therefore do not move as\nfast as the gas and do not give heat to the gas as readily as do smaller particles.\nThe larger particles have a lower momentum than an equivalent mass of smaller\nparticles and they reach the nozzle exit at a higher temperature than the smaller\nparticles, thus giving up less thermal energy.\n\nIt is possible to derive a simple theoretical approach for correcting the perfor-\nmance (/;,c, or c*) as shown below and as given in Refs. 3-13 and 3-14. It is\nusually based on the following assumptions: specific heats of the gases and the\nparticles are constant throughout the nozzle flow, the particles are small enough\nto move at essentially the same velocity as the gas and are in thermal equilibrium\nwith the gas, and that particles do not exchange mass with the gas (no vapor-\nization or condensation). Expansion and acceleration occur only in the gas, and\nthe volume occupied by the particles is negligibly small compared to the gas\nvolume. If the amount of particles is small, the energy needed to accelerate the\nparticles can also be neglected. There are no chemical reactions.\n\nThe enthalpy h, the specific volume V, the specific heat notes k, and the gas\nconstant R can be expressed as functions of the particle fraction 6, which is\nthe mass of particles (liquid and/or solid) divided by the total mass. Using the\nsubscripts g and s to refer to the gas or solid state, the following relationships\nthen apply:\n\nh=(1\u2014 B)(Cp)gT + BesT (3-35)\n\nV=Ve(1 \u2014 p) (3-36)\n\np=R,T/V, (3-37)\n\nR=(1\u20148)R, (3-38)\n\nk= = Bley + Bes (3-39)\n(1 \u2014 B)cy + Bes\n",
    "106": "3.5. REAL NOZZLES 89\nThese relations are then used in the formulas for simple one-dimensional nozzle\nflow, such as Eq. 2-16, 3-15, or 3-32. The values of specific impulse or char-\nacteristic velocity will decrease as f, the percent of particles, is increased. For\nvery small particles (less than 0.01 mm in diameter) and small values of 6 (less\nthan 6%) the loss in specific impulse is often less than 2%. For larger particles\n(over 0.015 mm diameter) and larger values of f this theory is not helpful and\nthe specific impulse can be 10 to 20% less than the /, value without flow lag.\nThe actual particle sizes and distribution depend on the specific propellant, the\ncombustion, the particular particle material, and the specific rocket propulsion\nsystem, and usually have to be measured (see Chapters 13 and 20). Thus adding\na metal, such as aluminum, to a solid propellant will increase the performance\nonly if the additional heat release can increase the combustion temperature 7;\nsufficiently so that it more than offsets the decrease caused by the nonexpanding\nmass of the particles in the exhaust.\n\nWith very high area ratio nozzles and a low nozzle exit pressure (high altitude\nor space vacuum) it is possible to condense some of the propellant ingredients\nthat are normally gases. As the temperature drops sharply in the nozzle, it is\npossible to condense gaseous species such as HO, CO2, or NH3 and form liquid\ndroplets. This causes a decrease in the gas flow per unit area and the transfer\nof the latent heat of vaporization to the remaining gas. The overall effect on\nperformance is small if the droplet size is small and the percent of condensed\ngas mass is moderate. It is also possible to form a solid phase and precipitate\nfine particles of snow (HO) or frozen fog of other species.\n\nOther Phenomena and Losses\n\nThe combustion process is really not steady. Low- and high-frequency oscillations\nin chamber pressure of up to perhaps 5% of rated value are usually considered\nas smooth-burning and relatively steady flow. Gas properties (k, Jt, c,) and flow\nproperties (v,V,7,p, etc.) will also oscillate with time and will not necessarily\nbe uniform across the flow channel. These properties are therefore only \u2018\u201caver-\nage\u201d values, but it is not always clear what kind of an average they are. The\nenergy loss due to nonuniform unsteady burning is difficult to assess theoret-\nically. For smooth-burning rocket systems they are negligibly small, but they\nbecome significant for larger-amplitude oscillations.\n\nThe composition of the gas changes somewhat in the nozzle, chemical reac-\ntions occur in the flowing gas, and the assumption of a uniform or \u201cfrozen\u201d\nequilibrium gas composition is not fully valid. A more sophisticated analysis for\ndetermining performance with changing composition and changing gas properties\nis described in Chapter 5. The thermal energy that is carried out of the nozzle\n(mcpT>2) is unavailable for conversion to useful propulsive (kinetic) energy, as is\nshown in Fig. 2-3. The only way to decrease this loss is to reduce the nozzle\nexit temperature T> (larger nozzle area ratio), but even then it is a large loss.\n\nWhen the operating durations are short (as, e.g., with antitank rockets or\npulsed attitude control rockets which start and stop repeatedly), the start and\n",
    "107": "90 NOZZLE THEORY AND THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONS\n\nstop transients are a significant portion of the total operating time. During the\ntransient periods of start and stop the average thrust, chamber pressure, or specific\nimpulse will be lower in value than those same parameters at steady full operating\nconditions. This can be analyzed in a step-by-step process. For example, during\nstartup the amount of propellant reacting in the chamber has to equal the flow\nof gas through the nozzle plus the amount of gas needed to fill the chamber to\na higher pressure; alternatively, an empirical curve of chamber pressure versus\ntime can be used as the basis of such a calculation. The transition time is very\nshort in small, low-thrust propulsion systems, perhaps a few milliseconds, but it\ncan be longer (several seconds) for large propulsion systems.\n\nPerformance Correction Factors\n\nAdditional to the theoretical cone- and bell-shaped nozzle correction factors dis-\ncussed in Section 3.4., we discuss here a set of empirical correction factors. These\nfactors represent a variety of nonideal phenomena (such as friction, imperfect\nmixing and combustion, heat transfer, chemical nonequilibrium, and two- and\nthree-dimensional effects) which are unavoidably present; refer to Fig. 2\u20143 and\nRef. 3\u20144. Correction factors are defined for convenience in rocket analysis and\nmay differ from the more conventional efficiencies\u2014there are no \u201cuniversal per-\nformance correction factors.\u201d For specific propulsion systems, where accurately\nmeasured data are available, they allow for simple predictions of the actual perfor-\nmance. For example, a velocity correction factor of 0.942 means that the velocity\nor the actual specific impulse is about 94% of theoretical (the commonly accepted\nvalue might be closer to 0.92).\n\nCorrections factors are used by engineers to predetermine performance ahead\nof testing, and for preliminary designs, informal proposals, and in health moni-\ntoring systems. For all these, a set of accepted or nominal values is needed to\nestimate performance together with some useful formula-recipes. For the most\naccurate calculations, the industry relies extensively on sophisticated computer\nprograms which are largely proprietary.\n\nCorrection factors are ratios of the measured or actual (subscript \u201ca\u201d) to\nthe formulated or ideal (subscript \u201ci\u201d) values. In the testing of propulsion sys-\ntems, the combustion chamber pressure, the propellant mass flow rates, the thrust\nforce, and the throat and exit areas are typically measured. These measurements\nyield two direct ratios, namely the thrust correction factor (\u20ac = Fa/F;) and the\ndischarge correction factor (Ca = Ma/mj;), and as well the product [(p1)a(Aral\nwhich has the units of force. This product enters into the formulation of two other\ncorrection factors discussed below. The nozzle area ratio [\u20acq = (A2)a/(Ar)a] in\nreal nozzles may be found from their measured dimensions and this ratio will\ndiffer from the ideal calculated value as will be shown in Example 3-7.\n\nThe thrust correction factor (\u00a2) is found from the ratio of thrust measurements\nwith the corresponding ideal values of Eq. 3-29.

NOZZLE ALIGNMENT\n\nWhen the thrust line or direction does not intersect the center of mass of a\nflying vehicle, a turning moment will tend to rotate a vehicle in flight. Turning\nmoments are desirable and necessary for the controlled turning or attitude control\nof a vehicle as is routinely done by means of the deflection of the thrust vector,\naerodynamic fins, or by separate attitude control rocket engines. However, this\nturning is undesirable when its magnitude or direction is not known; this happens\nwhen a fixed nozzle of a major propulsion system has its thrust axis misaligned.\nA large high-thrust booster rocket system, even if misaligned by a very small\nangle (less than 0.50\u00b0), can cause major upsetting turning moments for the firing\nduration. If not corrected or compensated, such a small misalignment can cause\nthe flight vehicle to tumble and/or deviate from the intended flight path. For\nthis moment not to exceed the vehicle\u2019s compensating attitude control capability,\nit is necessary to align the nozzle axis of all propulsion systems with fixed\n(nongimbal) nozzles very accurately. Normally, the geometric axis of the nozzle\ndiverging exit surface geometry is taken to be the thrust axis. Special alignment\nfixtures are usually needed to orient the nozzle axis to be within less than +0.25\u00b0\nof the intended line to the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity and to position the center\nof a large nozzle throat to be on the vehicle centerline, say within 1 or 2 mm.\nSee Ref. 3-16.\n\nThere are other types of misalignments: (1) irregularities in the nozzle geom-\netry (out of round, protuberances, or unsymmetrical roughness in the surface);\n(2) transient flow misalignments during start or stop; (3) uneven deflection of the\npropulsion system or vehicle structure under load; and (4) irregularities in the\ngas flow (faulty injector, uneven burning rate in solid propellants). For simple\nunguided rocket vehicles it has been customary to rotate or spin the vehicle to\nprevent the misalignment from being in one direction only or to even out the\nmisalignment during powered flight.\n\nIn the cramped volume of spacecraft or upper stage launch vehicles, it is\nsometimes not possible to accommodate the full length of a large-area-ratio nozzle\nwithin the available vehicle envelope. In this case the nozzles are cut off at an\nangle at the vehicle surface, which allows a more compact installation. Figure\n3-17 shows a diagram of two (out of four) roll control thrusters whose nozzle\nexit conforms to the vehicle contour. The thrust direction of a scarfed nozzle is\nno longer on the nozzle axis centerline, as it is with fully symmetrical nozzles,\nand the nozzle exit flow will not be axisymmetric.

It presents\nthe subjects from a rocket propulsion point of view. Rocket propulsion systems\nprovide forces to a flight vehicle and cause it to accelerate (or sometimes to\ndecelerate), overcome drag forces, or change flight direction. Some propulsion\nsystems provide also torques to the flight vehicles for rotation or maneuvers. The\nflight missions can be classified into several flight regimes: (1) flight within the\nearth\u2019s atmosphere (air-to-surface missiles, surface-to-surface short-range mis-\nsiles, surface-to-air missiles, air-to-air missiles, assisted takeoff units, sounding\nrockets, or aircraft rocket propulsion systems), Refs. 4\u20141 and 4\u20142; (2) near space\nenvironment (earth satellites, orbital space stations, or long-range ballistic mis-\nsiles), Refs. 4-3 to 4\u20149; (3) lunar and planetary flights (with or without landing\nor earth return), Refs. 4-5 to 4-12; and (4) deep space exploration and sun\nescape. Each is discussed in this chapter. The chapter begins with the analy-\nsis of simple one-dimensional space flight and then treats more complex fight\npath scenarios and various flying rocket-propelled vehicles. The appendices give\nconversion factors, atmosphere properties, and a summary of key equations.\n4.1. GRAVITY-FREE DRAG-FREE SPACE FLIGHT\nThis first simple rocket flight analysis applies to an outer space environment,\nfar away from any star, where there is no air (thus no drag) and essentially no\nsignificant gravitational attraction. The flight direction is the same as the thrust\ndirection (along the axis of the nozzle), namely, a one-dimensional, straight-line\nacceleration path; the propellant mass flow m and thus the propulsive thrust F\n103\n",

The vehicle mass ratio MR (final mass/initial mass or m,/mo ) and the\npropellant mass fraction \u00a2 have been defined by Eqs. 2\u20147 and 2-8. They are\nrelated by\n\n\u00a2=1\u2014MR=1-m/m =m,/m (4-4)\nA definition of the various masses is shown in Fig. 4-1. The initial mass at\ntakeoff mp equals the sum of the useful propellant mass m, plus the empty or\nfinal vehicle mass my; my in turn equals the sum of the inert masses of the\nengine system (such as nozzles, tanks, cases, or unused, residual propellant) plus\nthe guidance, control, electronics, and related equipment and the payload. The\nresidual propellant remaining in the propulsion system after thrust termination\nis not available for combustion and is usually considered to be a part of the final\nengine mass after operation. This is the liquid propellant trapped in pipe pockets,\nvalve cavities, and pumps or wetting the tank and pipe walls. For solid propellant\nrocket motors it is the remaining unburned solid propellant, also called slivers,\nand sometimes also unburned insulation.\n\nFor constant propellant mass flow m and a finite propellant burning time tf, the\ntotal propellant mass m, is mt, and the instantaneous vehicle mass m = mg \u2014 mt.\nEquation 4-1 can be written as\n\ndu = (F/m) dt = (cm/m) dt\n\u2014  (emjdt C(Mp /ty dt _ ch /th dt\nmo \u2014Mpt/ty \u2014 mo(1\u2014Mpt/moty) 1 \u2014 bt /ty\nThe start period and the shutdown period are very short and can be neglected.\nIntegration leads to the maximum vehicle velocity at propellant burnout u, that\n",

By increasing this ratio from 0.80 to\n0.90, the interplanetary maximum vehicle velocity in gravitationless vacuum is\nincreased by 43%. A mass fraction of 0.80 would indicate that only 20% of the\ntotal vehicle mass is available for structure, skin, payload, propulsion hardware,\n",
    "124": "4.2. FORCES ACTING ON A VEHICLE IN THE ATMOSPHERE 107\nradios, guidance system, aerodynamic lifting surfaces, and so on; the remaining\n80% is useful propellant. It requires careful design to exceed 0.85; mass fraction\nratios approaching 0.95 appear to be the probable practical limit for single-stage\nvehicles and currently known materials. When the mass fraction is 0.90, then\n1/MR = 0.1 and MR = 10.0. This marked influence of mass fraction or mass\nratio on the velocity at power cutoff, and therefore also the range, not only is\ntrue of interplanetary spaceships in a vacuum but applies to almost all types of\nrocket-powered vehicles. For this reason, importance is placed on saving inert\nmass on every vehicle component, including the propulsion system.\n\nEquation 4\u20146 can be modified and solved for the effective propellant mass m,\nrequired to achieve a desired velocity increment for a given initial takeoff mass\nor a final burnout mass of the vehicle. The final mass consists of the payload, the\nstructural mass of the vehicle, the empty propulsion system mass (which includes\nresidual propellant), plus a small additional mass for guidance, communications,\nand control devices. Here mp) = mo \u2014 mg:\n\nImp = mp (eA\"/\u00a9 \u2014 1) = mo(1 \u2014 e4/) (4-8)\n\nThe flight velocity increment up is proportional to the effective exhaust veloc-\nity c and, therefore, to the specific impulse. Thus any improvement in J, (such as\nbetter propellants, more favorable nozzle area ratio, or higher chamber pressure)\nreflects itself in improved vehicle performance, provided that such an improve-\nment does not also cause an excessive increase in rocket propulsion system inert\nmass, which causes a decrease in the effective propellant fraction.\n\n4.2. FORCES ACTING ON A VEHICLE IN THE ATMOSPHERE\n\nThe external forces commonly acting on vehicles flying in the earth\u2019s atmosphere\nare thrust, aerodynamic forces, and gravitational attractions. Other forces, such as\nwind or solar radiation pressure, are usually small and generally can be neglected\nfor many simple calculations.\n\nThe thrust is the force produced by the power plant, such as a propeller or a\nrocket. It usually acts in the direction of the axis of the power plant, that is, along\nthe propeller shaft axis or the rocket nozzle axis. The thrust force of a rocket\nwith constant mass flow has been expressed by Eq. 2-6 as a function of the\neffective exhaust velocity c and the propellant flow rate m. In many rockets the\nmass rate of propellant consumption 7m is essentially constant, and the starting\nand stopping transients are usually very short and can be neglected. Therefore,\nthe thrust is defined by Eq. 2-13 and is restated here with different parameters:\n\nF =cm =cmp/ty (4-9)\n\nAs explained in Chapter 3, for a given propellant the value of the effective\n\nexhaust velocity c or specific impulse J, depends in part on the nozzle area\n",
    "125": "108 FLIGHT PERFORMANCE\n\nratio and the altitude. The value of c can increase by a relatively small factor\nof between 1.2 and 1.6 as altitude is increased with a maximim value in space\n(vacuum).\n\nThe drag D is the aerodynamic force in a direction opposite to the flight path\ndue to the resistance of the body to motion in a fluid. The Jift L is the aerody-\nnamic force acting in a direction normal to the flight path. They are expressed\nas functions of the flight speed u, the mass density of the fluid (air) in which the\nvehicle moves p, and a typical surface area A:\n\nL=C,5pAu? (4-10)\n\nD = CpspAv? (4-11)\nwhere C, and Cp are lift and drag coefficients, respectively. For airplanes and\nwinged missiles the area A is the wing area. For wingless missiles or space launch\nvehicles it is the maximum cross-sectional area normal to the missile axis. The lift\nand drag coefficients are primarily functions of the vehicle configuration, flight\nMach number, and angle of attack, which is the angle between the vehicle axis\n(or the wing plane) and the flight direction. For low flight speeds the effect of\nMach number may be neglected, and the drag and lift coefficients are functions\nof the angle of attack. A typical variation of the drag and lift coefficients for a\ntypical supersonic missile is shown in Fig. 4-3. The values of these coefficients\nreach a maximum near a Mach number of unity. For wingless vehicles the angle\nof attack a is usually very small (0 < a < 1\u00b0). The density and other properties\nof the atmosphere are listed in Appendix 2. The local density of the earth\u2019s\natmosphere can vary day by day by a factor up to 2 (for altitudes of 300 to 1200\nkm) depending on solar activity and night-to-day temperature variations. This\nintroduces a major unknown in the drag. The aerodynamic forces are affected\nby the flow and pressure distribution of the rocket exhaust gases, as explained in\nChapter 20.\n\nThe flight regime in the neighborhood of Mach | is called the transonic phase\nof flight. Here strong unsteady aerodynamic forces can develop (due to buffeting)\nwhich are reflected in the steep rise and decrease of the coefficients seen in\nFig. 4-3. Marginal transonic load capabilities have led to structural failures of\nflight vehicles.\n\nFor space launch vehicles and ballistic missiles the integrated drag loss, when\nexpressed in terms of Au, is typically 5 to 10% of the final ideal vehicle velocity.\nThis relatively low value is due to the fact that the air density is low at high\naltitudes, when the velocity is high, and at low altitudes the air density is high\nbut the flight velocity and thus the dynamic pressure are low.\n\nGravitational attraction is exerted upon a flying space vehicle by all planets,\nstars, the moon, and the sun. Gravity forces pull the vehicle in the direction of\nthe center of mass of the attracting body. Within the immediate vicinity of the\nearth, the attraction of other planets and bodies is negligibly small compared to\nthe earth\u2019s gravitational force. This force is the weight.\n",

BASIC RELATIONS OF MOTION\n\nFor a vehicle that flies within the proximity of the earth, the gravitational attrac-\ntion of all other heavenly bodies may usually be neglected. Let it be assumed\nthat the vehicle is moving in rectilinear equilibrium flight and that all control\nforces, lateral forces, and moments that tend to turn the vehicle are zero. The\ntrajectory is two dimensional and is contained in a fixed plane. The vehicle has\nwings that are inclined to the flight path at an angle of attack a and that give a\nlift in a direction normal to the flight path. The direction of flight does not nec-\nessarily coincide with the direction of thrust. Figure 4\u20144 shows these conditions\nschematically.\n\nLet 6 be the angle of the flight path with the horizontal and y the angle\nof the direction of thrust with the horizontal. In the direction of the flight path\nthe product of the mass and the acceleration has to equal the sum of all forces,\nnamely the propulsive, aerodynamic, and gravitational forces:\n\nm(du/dt) = F cos(w \u2014 6) \u2014 D \u2014 mg sin\u00e9 (4-13)\nThe acceleration perpendicular to the flight path is u(d@/dt); for a constant value\nof u and the instantaneous radius R of the flight path it is u7/R.

See Refs. 4-1, 4-8, 4-11,\nand 4\u201412 for a background of flight performance in some of the flight regimes.\nDifferent flight performance parameters are maximized or optimized for different\nrocket flight missions or flight regimes, such as Au, range, orbit height and shape,\ntime-to-target, or altitude.

Results of such iterative\ncalculations of velocity, altitude, or range using the above two basic equations\noften are adequate for rough design estimates. For actual trajectory analyses, nav-\nigation computation, space flight path determination, or missile-firing tables, this\ntwo-dimensional simplified theory does not permit sufficiently accurate results.\nThe perturbation effects, such as those listed in Section 4.4, must then be con-\nsidered in addition to drag and gravity, and digital computers are necessary to\nhandle the complex relations. An arbitrary division of the trajectory into small\nelements and a step-by-step or numerical integration to define a trajectory are\nusually indicated. The more generalized three-body theory includes the gravi-\ntational attraction among three masses (for example, the earth, the moon, and\nthe space vehicle) and is considered necessary for many space flight problems\n(see Refs. 4\u20142 to 4-5). When the propellant flow and the thrust are not con-\nstant, when the flight path is three dimensional, the form and the solution to the\nequations above become more complex.\n\nA form of Eqs. 4-15 and 4-16 can also be used to determine the actual\nthrust or actual specific impulse during actual vehicle flights from accurately\nobserved trajectory data, such as from optical or radar tracking data. The vehicle\nacceleration (du/dt) is essentially proportional to the net thrust and, by making\nan assumption or measurement on the propellant flow (which usually varies in a\npredetermined manner) and an analysis of aerodynamic forces, it is possible to\ndetermine the rocket propulsion system\u2019s actual thrust under flight conditions.\n\nFor each mission of flight one can obtain actual histories of velocities and\ndistances traveled and thus complete trajectories when integrating Eqs. 4-15 and\n4-16. The more general case requires six equations; three for translation along\neach of three perpendicular axes and three for rotation about these axes. The\n",

A Hohmann transfer ellipse or a faster transfer path applies\nnot only to planetary flight but also to earth satellites, when an earth satellite\ngoes from one circular orbit to another (but within the same plane). Also, if\none spacecraft goes to a rendezvous with another spacecraft in a different orbit,\nthe two spacecraft have to be in the proper predetermined positions prior to the\nlaunch to simultaneously reach their rendezvous location.\n\nWhen the launch orbit (or launch planet) is not in the same plane as the target\norbit, then additional energy will be needed by applying thrust in a direction\nnormal to the launch orbit plane. More information is in Refs. 4\u20143, 4-4, 4-6,\nand 4-10.\n\nExample 4-2. A satellite is launched from a circular equatorial parking orbit at an\naltitude of 160 km into a coplanar circular synchronous orbit by using a Hohmann transfer\nellipse. Assume a homogeneous spherical earth with a radius of 6371 km. Determine the\nvelocity increments for entering the transfer ellipse and for achieving the synchronous\norbit at 42,200 km altitude.

For a more detailed treatment of flight paths and their\nperturbations, see Refs. 4-3, 4\u20144, and 4-13. A system is needed to measure\nthe satellite\u2019s position and deviation from the intended flight path, to determine\nthe needed periodic correction maneuver, and then to counteract, control, and\ncorrect them. This is called orbit maintenance; it corrects the perturbed or altered\norbit by periodically applying small rocket propulsion forces in predetermined\ndirections.

These corrections are needed throughout the life of the spacecraft (for\n1 to 20 years or sometimes more) to overcome the effects of the disturbances\nand maintain the intended flight regime.\n\nPerturbations can be categorized as short term and long term. The daily or\norbital period oscillating forces are called diurnal and those with long periods\nare called secular.\n\nHigh-altitude earth satellites (36,000 km and higher) experience perturbing\nforces primarily as gravitational pull from the sun and the moon, with the forces\nacting in different directions as the satellite flies around the earth. This third-body\neffect can increase or decrease the velocity magnitude and change its direction.\nIn extreme cases the satellite can come very close to the third body, such as a\nplanet or one of its moons, and undergo what is called a hyperbolic maneuver\nthat will radically change the trajectory. This encounter can be used to increase\nor decrease the energy of the satellite and intentionally change the velocity and\nthe shape of the orbit.\n\nMedium- and low-altitude satellites (500 to 35,000 km) experience perturba-\ntions because of the earth\u2019s oblateness. The earth bulges in the vicinity of the\nequator and a cross section through the poles is not entirely circular. Depending\non the inclination of the orbital plane to the earth equator and the altitude of the\nsatellite orbit, two perturbations result: (1) the regression of the nodes and (2)\nshifting of the apsides line (major axis). Regression of the nodes is shown in\nFig. 4-11 as a rotation of the plane of the orbit in space, and it can be as high\nas 9\u00b0 per day at relatively low altitudes.

Obviously, both the\napogee and perigee points change in position, the rate of change being a function\nof the satellite altitude and plane inclination angle. At an apogee altitude of 1000\nnautical miles (n.m.) and a perigee of 100 n.m. in an equatorial orbit, the apsidal\ndrift is approximately 10\u00b0 per day.\n\nSatellites of modern design, with irregular shapes due to protruding antennas,\nsolar arrays, or other asymmetrical appendages, experience torques and forces\nthat tend to perturb the satellite\u2019s position and orbit throughout its orbital life.\nThe principal torques and forces result from the following factors:\n\n1. Aerodynamic drag. This factor is significant at orbital altitudes below 500\n\nkm and is usually assumed to cease at 800 km above the earth. Reference\n4-8 gives a detailed discussion of aerodynamic drag, which, in addition\nto affecting the attitude of unsymmetrical vehicles, causes a change in\nelliptical orbits known as apsidal drift, a decrease in the major axis, and a\ndecrease in eccentricity of orbits about the earth. See Refs. 4-6, \u20148, \u201412,\nand \u201413.\n\n2. Solar radiation. This factor dominates at high altitudes (above 800 km)\nand is due to impingement of solar photons upon satellite surfaces. The\nsolar radiation pressure p (N/m\u2019) on a given surface of the satellite in the\nvicinity of the earth exposed to the sun can be determined as\n\np=45~x 10~\u00b0 cos 6[(1 \u2014 k,) cos 0 + 0.67ka] (4-32)\nwhere @ is the angle (degrees) between the incident radiation vector and the\nnormal to the surface and k; and ky are the specular and diffuse coefficients\nof reflectivity.

The radiation intensity varies as the square of\n",

The torque T on the\nvehicle is given by T = pAl, where A is the projected area and / is the\noffset distance between the spacecraft\u2019s center of gravity and the center\nof solar pressure. For a nonsymmetrical satellite with a large solar panel\non one side the radiation will cause a small torque, which will rotate the\nvehicle.\n\n3. Gravity gradients. Gravitational torque in spacecraft results from a vari-\nation in the gravitational force on the distributed mass of a spacecraft.\nDetermination of this torque requires knowledge of the gravitational field\nand the distribution of spacecraft mass. This torque decreases as a function\nof the orbit radius and increases with the offset distances of masses within\nthe spacecraft (including booms and appendages); it is most significant in\nlarge spacecraft or space stations operating in relatively low orbits (see\nRefs. 4\u20144 and 4-15.\n\n4. Magnetic field. The earth\u2019s magnetic field and any magnetic moment within\nthe satellite interact to produce torque. The earth\u2019s magnetic field precesses\nabout the earth\u2019s axis but is very weak (0.63 and 0.31 gauss at poles and\nequator, respectively). This field is continually fluctuating in direction and\nintensity because of magnetic storms and other influences. Since the field\nstrength decreases with 1/R? with the orbital altitude, magnetic field forces\nare often neglected in the preliminary analysis of satellite flight paths (see\nRef. 4-16).\n\n5. Internal accelerations. Deployment of solar array panels, the shifting of\nliquid propellant, the movement of astronauts or other masses within the\nsatellite, or the \u201cunloading\u201d of reaction wheels can produce torques and\nforces.\n\n6. For precise low earth orbits the oblateness of the earth (diameter at equator\nis slighty lerger than diameter between poles), high mountains, or earth\nsurface areas of different densities will perturb these orbits.\n\nWe can categorize satellite propulsion needs according to function as listed in\nTable 4\u20142, which shows the total impulse \u201cbudget\u201d applicable to a typical high-\naltitude, elliptic orbit satellite. The control system designer often distinguishes\ntwo different kinds of station-keeping orbit corrections needed to keep the satellite\nin a synchronous position. The east-west correction refers to a correction that\nmoves the point at which a satellite orbit intersects the earth\u2019s equatorial plane\nin an east or west direction; it usually corrects forces caused largely by the\noblateness of the earth. The north-south correction counteracts forces usually\nconnected with the third-body effects of the sun and the moon.\n\nIn many satellite missions the gradual changes in orbit caused by perturbation\nforces are not of concern. However, in certain missions it is necessary to com-\npensate for these perturbing forces and maintain the satellite in a specific orbit\nand in a particular position in that orbit. For example, a synchronous communi-\ncations satellite in a Geo-Synchronous Earth Orbit or GEO needs to maintain its\nposition and its orbit, so it will be able to (1) keep covering a specific area of the\n",

Another example is a Low Earth Orbit or LEO communications\nsatellite system with several coordinated satellites; here at least one satellite has\nto be in a position to receive and transmit radio-frequency (RF) signals to spe-\ncific points on the earth. Their orbits, and the relative positions of these several\nsatellites with respect to each other, need to be controlled and maintained (see\nRef. 4-3).\n\nOrbit maintenance means applying small correcting forces and torques peri-\nodically to compensate for perturbation effects; for GEO it is typically every few\nmonths. Typical velocity increments for the orbit maintenance of synchronous\nsatellites require a Au between 10 and 50 m/sec per year. For a satellite mass of\nabout 2000 kg a 50-m/sec correction for a 10-year orbit life would need a total\nimpulse of about 100,000 N-sec, which corresponds to a propellant mass of 400\nto 500 kg (about a quarter of the satellite mass) if done by a small monopro-\npellant or bipropellant thrust. It would require much less propellant if electrical\npropulsion were used, but in some spacecraft the inert mass of the power supply\nwould increase. See Refs. 4-6, 4\u201413, and 4-14.\n\nMission Velocity\n\nA convenient way to describe the magnitude of the energy requirement of a\nspace mission is to use the concept of the mission velocity. It is the sum of\nall the flight velocity increments needed (in all the vehicle\u2019s stages) to attain\nthe mission objective even though these increments are provided by different\npropulsion systems.

It is useful\nfor comparing one flight vehicle design with another and as an indicator of the\nmission energy.\n\nThe required mission velocity has to be equal to the \u201csupplied\u201d mission veloc-\nity, that is, the sum of all the velocity increments provided by the propulsion\nsystems of each of the various vehicle stages. The total velocity increment to be\n\u201csupplied\u201d by the shuttle\u2019s propulsion systems for the shuttle mission described\nbelow (solid rocket motor strap-on boosters, main engines and, for orbit injec-\ntion, also the increment from the orbital maneuvering system\u2014all shown in\nFig. 1-14) has to equal or exceed 9347 m/sec. If reaction control system propel-\nlant and an uncertainty factor are added, it will need to exceed 9621 m/sec. With\nchemical propulsion systems and a single stage, we can achieve a space mission\nvelocity of 4000 to 13,000 m/sec, depending on the payload, mass ratio, vehicle\ndesign, and propellant. With two stages it can be between perhaps 12,000 and\n22,000 m/sec.\n\nRotational maneuvers, described later, do not change the flight velocity and\nsome analysts do not add them to the mission velocity requirements. Also, main-\ntaining a satellite in orbit against long-term perturbing forces (see prior section)\nis often not counted as part of the mission velocity. However, the designers need\nto provide additional propulsion capability and propellants for these purposes.\nThese are often separate propulsion systems, called reaction control systems.\n\nTypical vehicle velocities required for various interplanetary missions have\nbeen estimated as shown in Table 4\u20144.

FLIGHT MANEUVERS\nIn this section we describe different flight maneuvers and relate them to specific\npropulsion system types. See Refs. 4-5, 4-11, 4-12, 4-13, and 4-14. The three\ncategories of maneuvers are:\n\n1. In translation maneuvers the rocket propulsion thrust vector goes through\nthe center of gravity of the vehicle. The vehicle momentum is changed\nin the direction of the flight velocity. An example of several powered\n(translational maneuvers) and unpowered (coasting) segments of a complex\nspace flight trajectory is shown in schematic, simplified form in Fig. 4-10.\nTo date, most maneuvers have used chemical propulsion systems.\n\n2. In truly rotational maneuvers there is no net thrust acting on the vehicle.\nThese are true force couples that apply only torque. It requires four thrusters\nto be able to rotate the vehicle in either direction about any one axis (two\nthrusters apart, firing simultaneously, but in opposite rotational directions).\nThese types of maneuver are usually provided by reaction control systems.\nMost have used multiple liquid propellant thrusters, but in recent years\nselected space missions have used electrical propulsion.\n\n3. A combination of categories 1 and 2, such as a misaligned thrust vector\nof a large thrust chamber that does not go exactly through the center of\ngravity of the vehicle. The misalignment can be corrected by changing\nthe vector direction of the main propulsion system (thrust vector control)\nduring powered flight or by applying a simultaneous compensating torque\nfrom a separate reaction control system.\n\nThe following types of space flight maneuvers and vehicle accelerations use\nrocket propulsion. All propulsion operations are usually controlled (started, mon-\nitored, and stopped) by the vehicle\u2019s guidance and control system.\n\na. First stage, its upper stage propulsion systems and strap-on boosters add\nmomentum during launch and ascent. They require rocket propulsion of\nhigh or medium thrusts and limited durations (typically 0.7 to 8 min). To\ndate all have used chemical propulsion systems. They constitute the major\nmass of the space vehicle and are discussed further in the next section.\n",
    "149": "132 FLIGHT PERFORMANCE\n\nb. Orbit injection or transferring from one orbit to another requires accurately\npredetermined total impulses. It can be performed by the main propulsion\nsystem of the top stage of the launch vehicle. More often it is done by a\nseparate propulsion system at lower thrust levels than the upper stages in\nitem (a) above. Orbit injection can be a single thrust operation after ascent\nfrom an earth launch station. If the flight path is a Hohmann transfer ellipse\n(minimum energy) or a faster transfer orbit, then two thrust application\nperiods are necessary, one at the beginning and one at the end of the\ntransfer path. For injection into earth orbit, the thrust levels are typically\nbetween 200 and 45,000 N or 50 and 11,000 Ibf, depending on the payload\nsize, transfer time, and specific orbit. If the new orbit is higher, then the\nthrusts are applied in the flight direction. If the new orbit is at a lower\naltitude, then the thrusts must be applied in a direction opposite to the\nflight velocity vector. The transfer orbits can also be achieved with a very\nlow thrust level (0.001 to 1 N) using an electric propulsion system, but\nthe flight paths will be very different (multiloop spiral) and the transfer\nduration will be much longer. This is explained in Chapter 17. Similar\nmaneuvers are also performed with lunar or interplanetary flight missions,\nlike the planetary landing mission shown schematically in Fig. 4\u201410.\n\nc. Velocity vector adjustment and minor in-flight correction maneuvers are\nusually performed with low-thrust, short-duration, and intermittent (puls-\ning) operations, using a reaction control system with multiple small liquid\npropellant thrusters, both for translation and rotation. The vernier rockets\non a ballistic missile are used to accurately calibrate the terminal velocity\nvector for improved target accuracy. The reaction control rocket systems\nin a space launch vehicle will allow accurate orbit injection adjustment\nmaneuvers after it is placed into orbit by another, less accurate propulsion\nsystem. Midcourse guidance-directed correction maneuvers for the trajecto-\nries of deep space vehicles fall also into this category. Propulsion systems\nfor orbit maintenance maneuvers, also called station-keeping maneuvers\n(to overcome perturbing forces), keep a spacecraft in its intended orbit and\norbital position and are also considered to be part of this category.\n\nd. Reentry and landing maneuvers can take several forms. If the landing\noccurs on a planet that has an atmosphere, then the drag of the atmosphere\nwill slow down the reentering vehicle. For a multiple elliptical orbit the\ndrag will progressively reduce the perigee altitude and the perigee velocity\non every orbit. Landing at a precise, preplanned location requires a particu-\nlar velocity vector at a predetermined altitude and distance from the landing\nsite. The vehicle has to be rotated into the right position and orientation,\nso as to use its heat shield correctly. The precise velocity magnitude and\ndirection prior to entering the denser atmosphere are critical for minimiz-\ning the heat transfer (usually to the vehicle\u2019s heat shield) and to achieve\ntouchdown at the intended landing site or, in the case of ballistic missiles,\nthe intended target. This usually requires a relatively minor maneuver (low\ntotal impulse). If there is very little or no atmosphere (for instance, landing\n",
    "150": "4.5. FLIGHT MANEUVERS 133\non the moon or Mercury), then a reverse thrust has to be applied during\ndescent and touchdown. The rocket propulsion system usually has variable\nthrust to assure a soft landing and to compensate for the decrease in vehi-\ncle mass as propellant is consumed during descent. The U.S. lunar landing\nrocket engine, for example, had a 10 to 1 thrust variation.\n\ne. Rendezvous and docking involve both rotational and translational maneu-\nvers of small reaction control thrusters. Rendezvous and its time windows\nwere discussed on page xxx. Docking (sometimes called lockon) is the\nlinking up of two spacecraft and requires a gradual gentle approach (low\nthrust, pulsing node thrusters) so as not to damage the spacecraft.\n\nf. Simple rotational maneuvers rotate the vehicle on command into a specific\nangular position so as to orient or point a telescope, instrument, solar panel,\nor antenna for purposes of observation, navigation, communication, or solar\npower reception. Such a maneuver is also used to keep the orientation of\na satellite in a specific direction; for example, if an antenna needs to be\ncontinuously pointed at the center of the earth, then the satellite needs to\nbe rotated around its own axis once every satellite revolution. Rotation\nis also used to point a nozzle of the primary propulsion system into its\nintended direction just prior to its start. It can also provide pulsed thrust\nfor achieving flight stability, or for correcting angular oscillations, that\nwould otherwise increase drag or cause tumbling of the vehicle. Spinning\nor rolling a vehicle about its axis will improve flight stability but will\nalso average out the misalignment in a thrust vector. If the rotation needs\nto be performed quickly, then a chemical multithruster reaction control\nsystem is used. If the rotational changes can be done over a long period of\ntime, then an electrical propulsion system with multiple thrusters is often\npreferred.\n\ng. A change of plane of the flight trajectory requires the application of a thrust\nforce (through the vehicle center of gravity) in a direction normal to the\noriginal plane of the flight path. This is usually performed by a propulsion\nsystem that has been rotated (by the reaction control system) into the proper\nnozzle orientation. This maneuver is done to change the plane of a satellite\norbit or when going to a planet, such as Mars, whose orbit is inclined to\nthe plane of the earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nh. Deorbiting and disposal of used or spent spacecraft is required today to\nremove space debris. The spent spacecraft should not become a hazard to\nother spacecraft. A relatively small thrust will cause the vehicle to go to\na low enough elliptical orbit so that atmospheric drag will cause further\nslowing. In the dense regions of the atmosphere the reentering, expended\nvehicle will typically break up or overheat (burn up).\n\ni. Emergency or alternative mission. If there is a malfunction in a spacecraft\nand it is decided to abort the mission, such as a premature quick return to\nthe earth without pursuing the originally intended mission, then some of\nthe rocket engines can be used for an alternate mission. For example, the\n",

The items\nwith a double mark \u201cx x\u201d have been the preferred methods in recent years. The\ntable omits several propulsion systems, such as solar thermal or nuclear rocket\npropulsion, because these have not yet flown in a routine space mission. The\nthree propulsion systems on the right of Table 4\u20146 are electrical propulsion sys-\ntems and they have very high specific impulse (see Table 2-1), which makes\nthem very attractive for deep space missions and for certain station-keeping jobs\n(orbit maintenance). However, they can be applied only to missions with suffi-\nciently long thrust action time for reaching the desired vehicle velocity or rotation\npositions with very small acceleration.\n\nReaction Control System\n\nThe functions of a reaction control system have been described in the previous\nsection on flight maneuvers. They are used for the maneuvers identified by para-\ngraphs c, e, and g. In some vehicle designs they are also used for tasks described\nin b, part of d, and f, if the thrust levels are low.\n\nA reaction control system (RCS), often called an auxiliary rocket propulsion\nsystem, is needed to provide for trajectory corrections (small Aw additions) as\nwell as correcting the rotational or attitude position of almost all spacecraft and all\nmajor launch vehicles. If only rotational maneuvers are made, it has been called\nan attitude control system. The nomenclature has not been consistent throughout\nthe industry or the literature.\n\nAn RCS can be incorporated into the payload stage and each of the stages of\na multiple-stage vehicle. In some missions and designs the RCS is built into only\nthe uppermost stage; it operates throughout the flight and provides the control\ntorques and forces for all the stages. For large vehicle stages the thrust level\nof multiple thrusters of an RCS can be large (500 to 15,000 lbf) and for termi-\nnal stages in small satellites they can be small (0.01 to 10.0 lbf) and they can\nbe pulsed as often as commanded by the vehicle flight control system. Liquid\npropellant rocket engines with multiple thrusters have been used for almost all\nlaunch vehicles and the majority of all spacecraft. Cold gas systems were used\nwith early spacecraft design. In the last decade an increasing number of elec-\ntrical propulsion systems have been used, primarily on spacecraft, as described\nin Chapter 17. The life of an RCS may be short (when used on an individual\nvehicle stage), or it may see use throughout the mission duration (perhaps more\nthan 10 years) when part of an orbiting spacecraft.\n",

With clever design it is possible to use fewer thrusters, but they will\nusually not provide a pure torque.\n\nAn RCS usually contains the following major subsystems: (1) sensing devices\nfor determining the attitude, velocity, and position of the vehicle with respect to a\nreference direction at any one time, such as provided by gyroscopes, star-trackers,\nor radio beacons; (2) a control-command system that compares the actual space\nand rotary position with the desired or programmed position and issues command\nsignals to change the vehicle position within a desired time period; and (3) devices\nfor changing the angular position, such as a set of high-speed gyroscopic wheels\nor a set of attitude control thrust-providing devices. See Refs. 4-13 and 4-14.\n",
    "154": "4.6. EFFECT OF PROPULSION SYSTEM ON VEHICLE PERFORMANCE = 137\n\nA precise attitude angular correction can also be achieved by the use of an\ninertial or high-speed rotating reaction wheel, which applies torque when its\nrotational speed is increased or decreased. While these wheels are quite simple\nand effective, the total angular momentum change they can supply is generally\nsmall. By using a pair of supplementary attitude control thrust rocket units it\nis possible to unload or respin each wheel so it can continue to supply small\nangular position corrections as needed.\n\nThe torque T of a pair of thrust chambers of thrust F and a separation distance\n1 is applied to give the vehicle with an angular or rotational moment of inertia\nM, an angular acceleration of magnitude a:\n\nT=Fl=M,a (4-33)\nFor a cylinder of equally distributed mass M, = pin? and for a homogeneous\nsphere it is M, = 2mr?.

If the angular acceleration\nis constant over a time period f, the vehicle will move at an angular speed w and\nthrough a displacement angle 6, namely\n@=at and 6= Sar? (4-34)\nCommonly a control system senses a small angular disturbance and then com-\nmands an appropriate correction. For this detection of an angular position change\nby an accurate sensor it is actually necessary for the vehicle to undergo a slight\nangular displacement. Care must be taken to avoid overcorrection and hunting\nof the vehicle position or the control system. This is one of the reasons many\nspacecraft require extremely short multiple pulses (0.010 to 0.030 sec) and low\nthrust (0.01 to 100 N) (see Refs. 4-11, 4-13, and 4-14).\n\nReaction control systems can be characterized by the magnitude of the total\nimpulse, the number, thrust level, and direction of the thrusters, and their duty\ncycles. The duty cycle refers to the number of thrust pulses, their operating times,\nthe times between thrust applications, and the timing of these short operations\nduring the mission operating period. For a particular thruster, a 30% duty cycle\nmeans an average active cumulative thrust period of 30% during the propul-\nsion system\u2019s flight duration. These propulsion parameters can be determined\nfrom the mission, the guidance and control approach, the desired accuracy, flight\nstability, the likely thrust misalignments of the main propulsion systems, the\nthree-dimensional flight path variations, the perturbations to the trajectory, and\nseveral other factors. Some of these parameters are often difficult to determine.\n4.6. EFFECT OF PROPULSION SYSTEM ON VEHICLE PERFORMANCE\nThis section gives several methods for improving flight vehicle performance.\nMost of these enhancements, listed below, are directly influenced by the flight\n",
    "155": "138 FLIGHT PERFORMANCE\n\nmission and by the selection or design of the propulsion system. A few of the\nflight vehicle performance improvements do not depend on the propulsion system.\nMost of those listed below apply to all missions, but some are peculiar to some\nmissions only.\n\n1. The effective exhaust velocity c and the specific impulse I; usually have a\ndirect effect on the vehicle\u2019s flight performance. The vehicle\u2019s final velocity\nincrement Au can be inceased by a higher /,. This can be done by using\na more energetic chemical propellant (see Chapters 7 and 12), by a higher\nchamber pressure, and, for upper stages operating at high altitudes, also\nby a larger nozzle area ratio. Electrical propulsion (higher /;) can enhance\nvehicle performance, but, as explained later, the very low thrusts do limit\nthis type to certain space missions. See Chapter 17.\n\n2. The mass ratio mo/my has a logarithmic effect. It can be increased in several\nways. One way is by reducing the final mass my, which consists of the inert\nhardware plus the nonusable, residual propellant mass. Reducing the inert\nmass implies lighter structures, smaller payloads, lighter guidance/control\ndevices, or less unavailable residual propellant; this means going to stronger\nstructural materials at higher stresses, more efficient power supplies, or\nsmaller electronic packages. During design there is always great emphasis\nto reduce all hardware masses and the residual propellants to their practical\nminima. Another way is to increase the initial vehicle mass, and use a higher\nthrust and more propellant, but with a smaller increase in the structure or\ninert propulsion system masses.\n\n3. Reducing the burning time (i.e., increasing the thrust level) will reduce the\ngravitational loss in some applications. However, the higher acceleration\nusually requires more structural and propulsion system mass, which in turn\ncauses the mass ratio to be less favorable.\n\n4. The drag, which can be considered as a negative thrust, can be reduced\nin at least four ways. The drag has several components: (a) The form drag\ndepends on the aerodynamic shape. A slender pointed nose or sharp, thin\nleading edges of fins or wings have less drag than a stubby, blunt shape.\n(b) A vehicle with a small cross-sectional area has less drag. A propulsion\ndesign that can be packaged in a long, thin shape will be preferred. (c) The\ndrag is proportional to the cross-sectional or frontal vehicle area. A higher\npropellant density will decrease the propellant volume and therefore will\nallow a smaller cross section. (d) The skin drag is caused by the friction of\nthe air flowing over all the vehicle\u2019s outer surfaces. A smooth contour and\na polished surface are usually better. The skin drag is also influenced by\nthe propellant density, because it gives a smaller volume and thus a lower\nsurface area. (e) The base drag is the fourth component; it is a function of\nthe local ambient air pressure acting over the surface of the vehicle\u2019s base\nor bottom plate. It is influenced by the nozzle exit design (exit pressure),\nthe discharge of turbine exhaust gases, and the geometry of the vehicle\nbase design. It is discussed further in Chapter 20.\n",
    "156": "4.7. FLIGHT VEHICLES 139\n\n5. The length of the propulsion nozzle often is a significant part of the overall\nvehicle or stage length. As was described in Chapter 3, there is an optimum\nnozzle contour and length, which can be determined by trade-off analysis.\nA shorter nozzle length or multiple nozzles on the same propulsion system\nallow a somewhat shorter vehicle; on many designs this implies a somewhat\nlighter vehicle structure and a slightly better vehicle mass ratio.\n\n6. The final vehicle velocity at propulsion termination can be increased by\nincreasing the initial velocity ug. By launching a satellite in an eastward\ndirection the rotational speed of the earth is added to the final satellite\norbital velocity. This tangential velocity of the earth is about 464 m/sec or\n1523 ft/sec at the equator and the Sea Launch from a ship on the equator\ntakes full advantage of this velocity increment. For an easterly launch at\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center (latitude of 28.5\u00b0 north) this extra velocity\nis about 408 m/sec or 1340 ft/sec. Conversely, a westerly satellite launch\nhas a negative initial velocity and thus requires a higher-velocity increment.\nAnother way to increase u is to launch a spacecraft from a satellite or an\naircraft, which increases the initial vehicle velocity and allows launching\nin the desired direction, or to launch an air-to-surface missile from an\nairplane. An example is the Pegasus three-stage space launch vehicle, which\nis launched from an airplane.\n\n7. For vehicles that fly in the atmosphere it is possible to increase the range\nwhen aerodynamic lift is used to counteract gravity and reduce gravity\nlosses. Using a set of wings or flying at an angle of attack increases the\nlift, but it also increases the drag. This lift can also be used to increase the\nmaneuverability and trajectory flexibility.\n\n8. When the flight velocity u is close to the rocket\u2019s effective exhaust velocity\nc, the propulsive efficiency is the highest (Eq. 2\u201423) and more of the\nrocket exhaust gas energy is transformed into the vehicle\u2019s flight energy.\nTrajectories where u is close in value to c for a major portion of the flight\ntherefore need less propellant.\n\nSeveral of these influencing parameters can be optimized. Therefore, for every\nmission or flight application there is an optimum propulsion system design and\nthe propulsion parameters that define the optimum condition are dependent on\nvehicle or flight parameters.\n\n4.7. FLIGHT VEHICLES\n\nAs mentioned, the vast majority of rocket-propelled vehicles are simple, single\nstage, and use solid propellant rocket motors. Most are used in military applica-\ntions, as described in the next section.

The total number of multi-\nstage rocket vehicles produced worldwide in the last few years has been between\n100 and 220 per year.\n\nA single stage to orbit (LEO) is limited in the payload it can carry. Figure 4-2\nshows that a high-performance single-stage vehicle with a propellant fraction of\n0.95 and an average J; of 400 sec can achieve an ideal terminal velocity of about\n12,000 m/sec without payload. If the analysis includes drag and gravity forces, a\nsomewhat higher value of /;, maneuvers in the trajectory, and an attitude control\nsystem, it is likely that the payload would be between 0.2 and 1.4% of the gross\ntakeoff mass, depending on the design. For a larger percentage of payload, and\nfor ambitious missions, we use vehicles with two or more stages as described\nhere.\n\nMultistage Vehicles\n\nMultistep or multistage rocket vehicles permit higher vehicle velocities, more\npayload for space vehicles, and improved performance for long-range ballistic\nmissiles. After the useful propellant is fully consumed in a particular stage,\nthe remaining empty mass of that expended stage is dropped from the vehicle\nand the operation of the propulsion system of the next step or stage is started.\nThe last or top stage, which is usually the smallest, carries the payload. The\nempty mass of the expended stage or step is separated from the remainder of\nthe vehicle, because it avoids the expenditure of additional energy for further\naccelerating a useless mass. As the number of steps is increased, the initial\ntakeoff mass can be decreased; but the gain in a smaller initial mass becomes less\napparent when the total number of steps is large. Actually, the number of steps\nchosen should not be too large, because the physical mechanisms become more\nnumerous, complex, and heavy. The most economical number of steps is usually\nbetween two and six, depending on the mission. Several different multistage\nlaunch vehicle configurations have been used successfully and four are shown in\nFig. 4-14. Most are launched vertically, but a few have been launched from an\nairplane, such as the three-stage Pegasus space vehicle. See Example 4-3.\n\nThe payload of a multistage rocket is essentially proportional to the takeoff\nmass, even though the payload is only a very small portion of the initial mass. If\na payload of 50 kg requires a 6000-kg multistage rocket, a 500-kg payload would\nrequire a 60,000-kg rocket unit with an identical number of stages and a similar\nconfiguration with the same payload fraction and the same propellants. When the\noperation of the upper stage is started, immediately after thrust termination of\nthe lower stage, then the total ideal velocity of a multistage vehicle of tandem\nor series-stage arrangement is simply the sum of the individual stage velocity\nincrements.

Figure 4-2\ncan be thus divided into regions for single- and tandem multistage vehicles.\nEquation 4-36 does not apply to parallel or partial staging as identified in\nFig. 4-14. For stages where more than one propulsion system is operating at\nthe same time and producing thrust in the same direction, the effective specific\nimpulse and nozzle exhaust velocity is given by Eqs. 10-12 to 10-14.\n\nThe first sketch in Fig. 4-14 depicts a very common configuration and the\nstages are stacked vertically on top of each other, as in the Minuteman long-\nrange missile or the Russian Zenit (Zenith) launch vehicle.* Partial staging was\nused on the early versions of the U.S. Atlas vehicle. It allows all engines to\nbe started at launching, thus avoiding an altitude start of the sustainer engine,\nwhich was unknown in those early days. Liquid propellant rocket engines can\nbe shut off on the launch stand if a failure is sensed prior to lift-off. The two\nAtlas booster engines arranged in a doughnut-shaped assembly are dropped off\nin flight. The third sketch has two or more separate booster \u201cstrap-on\u201d stages\nattached to the bottom stage of a vertical configuration (they can be either solid\nor liquid propellants) and this allows an increase in vehicle performance. The\npiggy-back configuration concept on the right is used on the Space Shuttle. The\ntwo large solid rocket motor boosters are not shown.\n\nStage Separation\n\nIt usually takes a finite time for the termination of the lower stage propulsion\nsystem to go from full thrust to essentially zero thrust (typically 1 to 3 sec for\nlarge thrust values). In some multistage flight vehicles (with stage separation\ndevices) there often was a further short delay (say 4 to 10 sec) to achieve a\nrespectable separation distance between the upper and the lower stage, before\nthe firing of the upper stage propulsion system was initiated. This was done in\norder to prevent blow-back of damaging hot flames onto the upper stage. Also\nthe upper stage engine start-up was not instantaneous but required one or more\nseconds. During this cumulative delay of several seconds the earth\u2019s gravity pull\ncontinues to diminish the vehicle\u2019s upward velocity, causing a reduction of the\nflight velocity by perhaps 20 to 500 ft/sec (7 to 160 m/sec). A scheme called\nhot staging has been used to diminish this velocity loss and shorten the staging\ntime interval. The upper stage propulsion system is actually started at low but\nincreasing thrust before the lower stage propulsion system has been fully shut off\nor well before it reaches essentially zero thrust. There are special flame-resistant\nducts in the interstage structure to allow the flame or hot exhaust gases of the\nupper stage engine to be safely discharged and deflected symmetrically prior to\nand immediately after the actual separation of the stages without harming the\nfunctional hardware of the vehicle. This hot staging scheme has been used on\nlarge multistage vehicles, such as the Titan II in the United States and certain\n*The three-stage Zenit space launch vehicle is assembled in the Ukraine with Russian rocket engines.\nIt is transported to the United States, loaded on a special floating launch platform (Sea Launch\nProgram), and launched by a team that is headed by the Boeing Company.\n",

The result is a payload of approximately 600 kg.\n\nIf a three-stage vehicle had been used in Example 4-3 instead of a two-\nstage version, the payload would have been even larger. However, the theoretical\npayload increase will only be about 8 or 10%. A fourth stage gives an even\nsmaller theoretical improvement; it would add only 3 to 5% to the payload. The\namount of potential performance improvement diminishes with each added stage.\nEach additional stage means extra complications in an actual vehicle (such as a\nreliable separation mechanism, an interstage structure, more propulsion systems,\njoints or couplings in connecting pipes and cables, etc.), requires additional inert\nmass (increasing the mass ratio MR), and compromises the overall reliability.\nTherefore, the minimum number of stages that will meet the payload and the Au\nrequirements is usually selected.\n\nThe flight paths taken by the vehicles in the two simplified cases of\nExample 4-3 are different, since the time of flight and the acceleration histories\nare different. One conclusion from this example applies to all multistage\nrocket-propelled vehicles; for each mission there is an optimum number of\nstages, an optimum distribution of the mass between the stages, and usually also\nan optimum flight path for each design, where a key vehicle parameter such as\npayload, velocity increment, or range is a maximum.\n\nLaunch Vehicles\n\nUsually the first or lowest stage, often called a booster stage, is the largest and it\nrequires the largest thrust and largest total impulse. For earth surface launch all\nstages now use chemical propulsion to achieve the desired thrust-to-weight ratio.\nThese thrusts usually become smaller with each subsequent stage, also known\nas upper stage or sustainer stage. The thrust magnitudes depend on the mass of\nthe vehicle, which in turn depends on the mass of the payload and the mission.\nTypical actual configurations are shown by simple sketches in Fig. 4-14. There\nis an optimum size and thrust value for each stage in a multistage vehicle and\nthe analysis to determine these optima can be quite complex.\n\nMany launch vehicles with heavy payloads have one to six large strap-on\nstages, also called zero stages or half stages. They augment the thrust of the\nbooster stage, which is started at about the same time. A schematic diagram\nis shown in the third sketch of Fig. 4-14. Solid propellant strap-on stages are\ncommon, such as the Atlas V shown in Fig. 1-13 or the Space Shuttle shown in\nFig. 1-14. They are usually smaller in size than the equivalent liquid propellant\nstrap-on (due to higher propellant density) and have less drag and usually a very\ntoxic exhaust. Liquid propellant strap-on stages are used in the Delta IV heavy\nlift launch vehicle (see Fig. 1-12), in the first Soviet ICBM (intercontinental\nballistic missile, 1950s), and several Soviet/Russian space launch vehicles. They\n",

The smaller ones are for low\npayloads and low orbits; the larger ones usually have more stages, are heav-\nier and more expensive, and have larger payloads or higher mission velocities.\nThe vehicle cost increases with the number of stages and the initial vehicle\nlaunch mass. Once a particular launch vehicle has been proven to be reliable,\nit is usually modified and uprated to allow improvements in its capability or\nmission flexibility. Each of the stages of a space launch vehicle can have sev-\neral rocket engines, each for specific missions or maneuvers. The Space Shuttle\nsystem has 67 different rockets which are shown schematically in Fig. 1-14.\nIn most cases each rocket engine is used for a specific maneuver, but in many\ncases the same engine is used for more than one specific purpose; the small reac-\ntion control thrusters in the Shuttle serve, for example, to give attitude control\n(pitch, yaw, and roll) during orbit insertion and reentry, for counteracting internal\nshifting of masses (astronaut movement, extendible arm), small trajectory correc-\ntions, minor flight path adjustments, docking, and precise pointing of scientific\ninstruments.\n\nThe spacecraft is that part of a launch vehicle that carries the payload. It is the\nonly part of the vehicle that goes into orbit or deep space and some are designed\nto return to earth. The final major space maneuver, such as orbit injection or\nplanetary landing, often requires a substantial velocity increment; the propulsion\nsystem, which provides the force for this maneuver, may be integrated with the\nspacecraft or it may be part of a discardable stage, just below the spacecraft.\nSeveral of the maneuvers described in Section 4.5 can often be accomplished by\npropulsion systems located in two different stages of a multistage vehicle. The\nselection of the most desirable propulsion systems, and the decision of which\nof the several propulsion systems will perform specific maneuvers, will depend\non optimizing performance, cost, reliability, schedule, and mission flexibility as\ndescribed in Chapter 19.\n\nWhen a space vehicle is launched from the earth\u2019s surface into an orbit, it flies\nthrough three distinct trajectory phases. (1) Most are usually launched vertically\nand then undergo a turning maneuver while under rocket power to point the flight\nvelocity vector into the desired direction. (2) The vehicle then follows a free-\nflight (unpowered) ballistic trajectory (usually elliptical), up to its apex. Finally\n(3) a satellite needs an extra push from a chemical rocket system to add enough\ntotal impulse or energy to accelerate it to orbital velocity. This last maneuver\nis also known as orbit insertion or sometimes as a kick maneuver. During the\ninitial powered flight the trajectory angle and the thrust cutoff velocity of the last\nstage are adjusted by the guidance system to a velocity vector in space that will\nallow the vehicle to reach the apogee of its elliptic path exactly at the desired\norbit altitude. As shown in Fig. 4-9, a multistage ballistic missile follows the\nsame two ascent flight phases mentioned above, but it then continues its elliptical\nballistic trajectory all the way down to the target.\n",

This is an air-launched, relatively simple,\nthree-stage launch vehicle of 50in. diameter driven by a solid propellant rocket motor in\neach stage. (Courtesy Orbital Sciences Corporation.)\n\nHistorically successful launch vehicles have been modified, enlarged, and\nimproved in performance. The newer versions retain most of the old, proven, reli-\nable components, materials, and subsystems. This reduces development effort and\ncost. Upgrading a vehicle allows an increase in mission energy (more ambitious\nmission) or payload or both. Typically, it is done by one or more of these types\nof improvement: increasing the mass of propellant without an undue increase in\ntank or case mass; uprating the thrust and strengthening the engine; more specific\nimpulse; or adding successively more or bigger strap-on boosters. It also usually\nincludes a strengthening of the structure to accept higher loads.\n\nFigure 4\u201415 shows the effects of orbit inclination and altitude on the payload.\nThe inclination is the angle between the equatorial plane of the earth and the\ntrajectory. An equatorial orbit has zero inclination and a polar orbit has 90\u00b0\ninclination. Since the earth\u2019s rotation gives the vehicle an initial velocity, a launch\nfrom the equator in an eastward direction will give the highest payload. For the\nsame orbit altitude other trajectory inclinations have a lower payload. For the\nsame inclination the payload decreases with orbit altitude, since more energy has\nto be expended to overcome gravitational attraction.\n",
    "165": "148 FLIGHT PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Space Shuttle has its maximum payload when launched due east into\nan orbit with 28.5\u00b0 inclination from Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida,\nnamely about 56,000 Ib (or 25,455 kg) at a 100-nautical-mile (185-km) orbit\naltitude. The payload decreases by about 100 lb (45.4 kg) for every nautical mile\nincrease in altitude. If the inclination is 57\u00b0, the payload diminishes to about\n42,000 Ib (or 19,090 kg). If launched in a southerly direction from Vandenberg\nAir Force Base on the west coast in a 98\u00b0 inclination into a circular, nearly polar\norbit, the payload will be only about 30,600 Ib or 13,909 kg.\n\nThe dramatic decrease of payload with circular orbits of increasing altitude\nand with different inclination is shown for the Pegasus, a relatively small, air-\nlaunched space launch vehicle, in Fig. 4-15. The payload is a maximum when\nlaunching from the earth equator in the east direction, that is, at 0\u00b0 inclination.\nThe figure shows that a practical payload becomes too small for orbits higher\nthan about 1200 km. To lift heavier payloads and to go to higher orbits requires a\nlarger launch vehicle than this Pegasus. Figure 4\u201415 is based on the assumption\nof a particular payload separation mechanism (38 in.) and a specific Au vehicle\nvelocity reserve (220 ft/sec) for items such as the normal changes in atmospheric\ndensity (which can double the drag) or mass tolerances of the propulsion systems.\nSimilar curves can usually be provided by the makers of all launch vehicles.\n4.8. MILITARY MISSILES\nThe majority of all rocket propulsion systems built today are for military pur-\nposes. There is a large variety of missiles and military missions and therefore\nmany different propulsion systems. All are chemical propulsion systems. They\nrange from simple, small, unguided, fin-stabilized single-stage rocket projectiles\n(used in air-to-surface missions and surface-to-surface bombardment) up to com-\nplex, sophisticated, expensive, long-range, multistage ballistic missiles, which\nare intended for faraway military or strategic targets. The term \u201csurface\u201d means\nland surface (ground launch or ground target), ocean surface (ship launched),\nor below the ocean surface (submarine launched). A tactical missile is used for\nattacking or defending ground troops, nearby military or strategic installations,\nmilitary aircraft, or war missiles. The armed forces also use military satellites\nfor missions such as reconnaissance, early warning of impending attack, secure\ncommunication, or navigation.\n\nStrategic missiles with a range of 3000 km or more have been two- or\nthree-stage surface-to-surface rocket-propelled missiles. Early designs used liq-\nuid propellant rocket engines and some are still in service in certain countries.\nBeginning about 37 years ago, newer strategic missiles have used solid propellant\nrocket motors in the United States and France. Both types usually also have a\nliquid propellant RCS for accurately adjusting the final payload flight velocity\n(in magnitude, direction, and position in space) at the cutoff of the propulsion\nsystem of the last stage. A solid propellant RCS version also exists. The flight\nanalysis and ballistic trajectories of the long-range missiles are similar in many\nways to those described for launch vehicles in this chapter.\n",
    "166": "4.8. MILITARY MISSILES 149\n\nSolid propellant rocket motors are preferred for most tactical missile missions,\nbecause they allow simple logistics and can be launched quickly. If altitudes are\nlow and flight durations are long, such as with a cruise missile, an air-breathing jet\nengine and a winged vehicle, which provides lift, will usually be more effective\nthan a long-duration rocket. However, a large solid propellant rocket motor may\nstill be needed as a booster to launch the cruise missile and bring it up to speed.\n\nFor each of the tactical missile applications, there is an optimum rocket propul-\nsion system and almost all of them use solid propellant rocket motors. Liquid\npropellant rocket engines have recently been used for the upper stages of two-\nstage anti-aircraft missiles and ballistic defense missiles, because they can be\npulsed for different durations and can be randomly throttled. For each appli-\ncation there is an optimum total impulse, an optimum thrust time profile, an\noptimum nozzle configuration (single or multiple nozzles, with or without thrust\nvector control, optimum area ratio), optimum chamber pressure, and a favored\nsolid propellant grain configuration. Low exhaust plume gas radiation emissions\nin the visible, infrared, or ultraviolet spectrum and certain safety features (making\nthe system insensitive to energy stimuli) can be very important in some of the\ntactical missile applications; these are discussed in Chapters 13 and 20.\n\nShort-range, uncontrolled, unguided, single-stage rocket vehicles, such as mil-\nitary rocket projectiles (ground and air launched) and rescue rockets, are usu-\nally quite simple in design. Their general equations of motion are derived in\nSection 4.3, and a detailed analysis is given in Ref. 4-1.\n\nUnguided military rocket-propelled missiles are today produced in larger num-\nbers than any other category of rocket-propelled vehicles. The 2.75-in.-diameter,\nfolding fin unguided solid propellant rocket missile has recently been produced\nin the United States in quantities of almost 250,000 per year. Guided missiles for\nanti-aircraft, antitank, or infantry support have been produced in annual quanti-\nties of hundreds and sometimes over a thousand. Table 1-6 lists several guided\nmissiles.\n\nBecause these rocket projectiles are essentially unguided missiles, the accuracy\nof hitting a target depends on the initial aiming and the dispersion induced by\nuneven drag, wind forces, oscillations, and misalignment of nozzles, body, and\nfins. Deviations from the intended trajectory are amplified if the projectile is\nmoving at a low initial velocity, because the aerodynamic stability of a projectile\nwith fins is small at low flight speeds. When projectiles are launched from an\naircraft at a relatively high initial velocity, or when projectiles are given stability\nby spinning them on their axis, their accuracy of reaching a target is increased\n2- to 10-fold, compared to a simple fin-stabilized rocket launched from rest.\n\nIn guided air-to-air and surface-to-air rocket-propelled missiles the time of\nflight to a given target, usually called the time to target t;, is an important flight\nperformance parameter. With the aid of Fig. 4-16 it can be derived in a simplified\nform by considering the distance traversed by the rocket (called the range) to\nbe the integrated area underneath the velocity\u2014time curve. This simplification\nassumes no drag, no gravity effect, horizontal flight, a relatively small distance\ntraversed during powered flight compared to the total range, and a linear increase\n",

More\naccurate values can also be obtained through a detailed step-by-step trajectory\nanalysis that considers the effects of drag and gravity.\n\nIn unguided air-to-air or air-to-surface rocket-powered projectiles the aiming\nat the target is done largely by orienting the launching aircraft into the direction of\nthe target. A relatively simple solid propellant rocket motor is the most common\nchoice for the propulsion. In guided missiles, such as air-to-air, air-to-ground, or\nground-to-air, the flight path to the target has to be controlled and this can be\nachieved by controlling aerodynamic control surfaces and/or propulsion systems,\nwhich can be pulsed (repeated start and stop) and/or throttled to a lower thrust.\nThe guidance system and the target seeker system of a guided missile will sense\nand track the flight path of a flying target, a computer will calculate a predicted\nimpact point, and the missile\u2019s flight control will change the flight path of the\nguided missile to achieve the impact with the intended target. The control system\nwill command the propulsion system to operate or fire selected liquid propellant\nthrusters of an engine with multiple thrusters (or to selectively provide thrust\nthrough multiple nozzles with hot-gas shut-off valves in solid motors).

Rocket engines with these capabilities\nare discussed in Section 6.8.\n\nIn both the unguided projectile and the guided missile the hit probability\nincreases as the time to target t; is reduced. In one particular air-to-air combat\nsituation, the effectiveness of the rocket projectile varied approximately inversely\nas the cube of the time to target. The best results (e.g., best hit probability) are\nusually achieved when the time to target is as small as practically possible.\n\nThe analysis of the missile and propulsion configuration that gives the min-\nimum time to target over all the likely flight scenarios can be complex. The\nfollowing rocket propulsion features and parameters will help to reduce the time\nto target, but their effectiveness will depend on the specific mission, range, guid-\nance and control system, and particular flight conditions.\n\n1. High initial thrust or high initial acceleration for the missile to quickly\n\nreach a high-initial-powered flight velocity.\n\n2. Application of additional lower thrust to counteract drag and gravity losses\nand thus maintain a high flight velocity. This can be a single rocket propul-\nsion system that has a short high initial thrust and a smaller (10 to 25%)\nsustaining thrust of longer duration.\n\n3. For higher supersonic flight speeds, a two-stage missile can be more effec-\ntive. Here the first stage is dropped off after its propellant has been con-\nsumed, thus reducing the inert mass of the next stage and improving its\nmass ratio and thus its flight velocity increase.\n\n4. If the target is highly maneuverable and if the closing velocity between\nmissile and target is large, it may be necessary not only to provide an\naxial thrust but also to apply large side forces or side accelerations to a\ndefensive tactical missile. This can be accomplished either by aerodynamic\nforces (lifting surfaces or flying at an angle of attack) or by multiple-nozzle\npropulsion systems with variable or pulsing thrusts; the rocket engine then\nwould have an axial thruster and one or more side thrusters. The side\nthrusters have to be so located that all the thrust forces are essentially\ndirected through the center of gravity of the vehicle in order to minimize\nturning moments. The thrusters that provide the side accelerations have\nalso been called divert thrusters, since they divert the vehicle in a direction\nnormal to the axis of the vehicle.\n\n5. Drag losses can be reduced if the missile has a large L/D ratio (or a small\ncross-sectional area) and if the propellant density is high, allowing a smaller\nmissile volume. The drag forces can be high if the missile travels at low\naltitude and high speed. A long and thin propulsion system geometry and\na high-density propellant will help to reduce drag.\n\nA unique military application is rocket-assisted gun-launched projectiles for\n\nattaining longer artillery ranges.

FLIGHT STABILITY\n\nStability of a vehicle is achieved when the vehicle does not rotate or oscil-\nlate in flight. Unstable flights are undesirable, because pitch or yaw oscillations\nincrease drag (flying at an angle of attack most of the time) and cause prob-\nlems with instruments and sensors (target seekers, horizon scanners, sun sensors,\nor radar). Instability often leads to tumbling (uncontrolled turning) of vehicles,\nwhich causes missing of orbit insertion, missing targets, or sloshing of liquid\npropellant in tanks.\n\nStability can be built in by proper design so that the flying vehicle will be\ninherently stable, or stability can be obtained by appropriate controls, such as\nthe aerodynamic control surfaces on an airplane, a reaction control system, or\nhinged multiple rocket nozzles.\n\nFlight stability exists when the overturning moments (e.g., those due to a wind\ngust, thrust misalignment, or wing misalignment) are smaller than the stabilizing\nmoments induced by thrust vector controls or by aerodynamic control surfaces.\nWhen the destabilizing moments exceed the stabilizing moments about the center\nof gravity, the vehicle turns or tumbles. In unguided vehicles, such as low-altitude\nrocket projectiles, stability of flight in a rectilinear motion is achieved by giving\na large stability margin to the vehicle by using tail fins and by locating the center\nof gravity ahead of the center of aerodynamic pressure. In a vehicle with an\nactive stability control system, a nearly neutral inherent stability is desired, so\nthat the applied control forces are small, thus requiring small control devices,\nsmall RCS thrusters, small actuating mechanisms, and structural mass. Neutral\nstability is achieved by locating aerodynamic surfaces and the mass distribution\nof the components within the vehicle in such a manner that the center of gravity is\nonly slightly above the center of aerodynamic pressure. Because the aerodynamic\nmoments change with Mach number, the center of pressure does not necessarily\nstay fixed during accelerating flight but shifts, usually along the vehicle axis.\nThe center of gravity also changes its position as propellant is consumed and the\nvehicle mass decreases. Thus it is usually very difficult to achieve neutral missile\nstability at all altitudes, speeds, and flight conditions.\n\nStability considerations affect rocket propulsion system design in several ways.\nBy careful nozzle design and careful installation it is possible to minimize thrust\nmisalignment and thus to minimize undesirable torques on the vehicle and the\nreaction control propellant consumption. It is possible to exercise considerable\ncontrol over the travel of the center of gravity by judicious design. In liquid\npropellant rockets, special design provisions, special tank shapes, and a careful\nselection of tank location in the vehicle afford this possibility. By using nozzles\nat the end of a blast tube, as shown in Fig. 15\u20146, it is possible to place the solid\npropellant mass close to the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity. Attitude control liquid\n",

This is similar to the rotation given\nto bullets by spiral-grooved barrels. This spin stability is achieved in part by\ngyroscopic effects, where an inclination of the spin axis is resisted by torques. The\ncentrifugal effects cause problems in emptying liquid propellant tanks and extra\nstresses on solid propellant grains.

    "175": "CHAPTER 5\nSS\nCHEMICAL ROCKET PROPELLANT\nPERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\n\nIn Chapter 3, simplified one-dimensional performance relations were developed.\nThey require a knowledge of the composition of the hot rocket gas and\nthe properties of the propellant reaction products, such as their combustion\ntemperature 7), average molecular mass 9t, and the specific heat ratio or\nthe enthalpy change (h; \u2014 hz). This chapter discusses several approaches to\ndetermine these theoretical thermochemical properties for a given composition\nor mixture of propellant, chamber pressure, nozzle shape, and nozzle exit\npressure. This then allows the determination of performance parameters, such\nas theoretical specific impulse or exhaust velocity for chemical rockets.\n\nBy knowing the calculated gas temperature, pressure, and gas composition\nit is possible to calculate other gas properties. This knowledge also allows\nthe analysis and selection of materials for chamber and nozzle structures.\nHeat transfer analyses require the determination of the specific heats, thermal\nconductivity, and specific heat ratio for the gas mixture. The calculated exhaust\ngas composition forms the basis for estimating environmental effects, such as\nthe potential spreading of a toxic cloud near a launch site, as discussed in\nChapter 21. The exhaust gas parameters also form the basis for the analysis of\nexhaust plumes (Chapter 20) or flames external to the nozzle.\n\nWith the advent of digital computers it has been possible to solve the set of\nequations involving mass balance, energy balance, together with thermodynamic\nand chemical equilibria of complex systems with a variety of propellant ingre-\ndients. This chapter is intended to introduce the background to this theoretical\nanalysis, so the reader can understand the thermodynamic and chemical basis\nof the several computer programs that are in use today. This chapter does not\ndescribe any specific computer analysis programs. However, it discusses which\n158\n",
    "176": "5.1. BACKGROUND AND FUNDAMENTALS 159\nof the physical phenomena or chemical reactions can or cannot be adequately\nsimulated by computer analysis.\n\nThe reader is referred to Refs. S\u20141 to 5\u20145 for general chemical and thermo-\ndynamic background and principles. For a detailed description of the properties\nof each of the possible reactant and reaction products, see Refs. 5\u20146 to 5-12.\n\nAll of these theoretical analyses are only approximations of what really\nhappens in rocket combustion and nozzle flow, since they all require some\nsimplifying assumptions. As more of the different phenomena are understood\nand mathematically simulated, the analysis approach and the computer imple-\nmentation become more realistic but also more complex. The 11 assumptions\nmade in Section 3.1 for an ideal rocket are valid here also but only for a\nquasi-one-dimensional flows. However, more sophisticated analyses can make\none or more of these assumptions unnecessary. The analysis is usually divided\ninto two somewhat separate sets of calculations:\n\n1. The combustion process is the first part. It usually occurs in the combus-\ntion chamber at essentially constant chamber pressure (isobaric) and the\nresulting gases follow Dalton\u2019s law, which is discussed in this chapter.\nThe chemical reactions or the combustions occur very rapidly. The cham-\nber volume is assumed to be large enough and the residence time in the\nchamber long enough for attaining chemical equilibrium in the chamber.\n\n2. The nozzle gas expansion process constitutes the second set of calculations.\nThe fully reacted, equilibrated gas combustion products enter the nozzle\nand undergo an adiabatic expansion in the nozzle. The entropy remains\nconstant during a reversible (isentropic) nozzle gas expansion, but in real\nnozzles it increases slightly.\n\nThe principal chemical reactions occur inside the combustion chamber of a\nliquid propellant rocket engine or inside the grain cavity of a solid propellant\nrocket motor, usually within a short distance from the burning surface. These\nchamber combustion analyses are discussed further in Chapters 9 and 14. How-\never, some chemical reactions also occur in the nozzle as the gases expand;\nthe composition of the reaction products can therefore change in the nozzle, as\ndescribed in this chapter. A further set of chemical reactions can occur in the\nexhaust plume outside the nozzle, as described in Chapter 20; many of the same\nbasic thermochemical analysis approaches described in this chapter also apply to\nexhaust plumes.\n\n5.1. BACKGROUND AND FUNDAMENTALS\n\nThe analytical description of chemical reaction or combustion of one or more\nfuels with one or more oxidizing reactants is the basis of chemical rocket propul-\nsion. The heat liberated in this reaction transforms the propellants (reactants) into\n",
    "177": "160 = CHEMICAL ROCKET PROPELLANT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\nhot gaseous products, which in turn are thermodynamically expanded in a nozzle\nto produce thrust.\n\nThe chemical reactants or propellants can initially be either liquid or solid\nand occasionally also gaseous. The reaction products are usually gaseous, but\nwith some propellants one or more reactant species remain in the solid or liquid\nphase. For example, with aluminized solid propellants, the chamber reaction gases\ncontain liquid aluminum oxide and the colder gases in the nozzle exhaust contain\nsolid, condensed aluminum oxide particles. For some of the chemical species,\ntherefore, the analysis must consider as many as all three phases and the energy\nchanges for the phase transitions must be included. When the amount of solid or\nliquid in the exhaust is small and the particles are small, to assume a perfect gas\nintroduces only small errors.\n\nIt is necessary to accurately know the chemical composition of the propel-\nlants and their relative proportion. In liquid propellant this means the mixture\nratio and the major propellant impurities; in gelled or slurried liquid propellants\nit also includes suspended or dissolved solid materials; and in solid propellants\nit means all the ingredients, their proportions and impurities, and phase (some\ningredients, such as plasticizers, can be in a liquid state).\n\nDalton\u2019s law applies to the gas resulting from the combustion. It states that\na mixture of gases at equilibrium exerts a pressure that is the sum of the par-\ntial pressures of the individual gases, all at a common volume and a common\ntemperature. The subscripts a, b, c, and so on refer to individual gas constituents:\n\nP=PatPot+Pet**: (5-1)\nT=T,=T), =T.=::: (5-2)\n\nThe perfect gas equation pV = RT applies very closely to high-temperature\ngases. Here V is the specific volume or the volume per unit mass of gas mixture,\nand the gas constant R for the mixture is obtained by dividing the universal\ngas constant R\u2019 (8314.3 J/kg-mol-K) by the average molecular mass 9M (often\nerroneously called the molecular weight) of the gas mixture. Using Dalton\u2019s law,\nEq. 5-1 can be rewritten\n\nDP =RaT Va + RoT [Vp + ReT [Ve +++ = R'TI(MV mix) (5-3)\nThe volumetric proportions of gas species in a gas mixture are determined from\nthe molar concentration or molar fractions , nj, expressed as kg-mol for a partic-\nular species j per kg of mixture.

For example, consider this reaction:\n\nH + 40) > H20 (5-8)\nAll the hydrogen and oxygen are fully consumed to form the single\nproduct\u2014water vapor\u2014without any reactant residue of either hydrogen or\noxygen. In this case it requires 1 mol of the Hz and ; mole of the O2 to obtain\n1 mol of H2O. On a mass basis this stoichiometric mixture requires half of\n32.0 kg of Oy and 2 kg of Ho, which are in the stoichiometric mixture mass\nratio of 8:1. The release of energy per unit mass of propellant mixture and the\ncombustion temperature are highest at or near the stoichiometric mixture.\n\nRocket propulsion systems usually do not operate with the proportion of their\noxidizer and fuel in the stoichiometric mixture ratio. Instead, they usually operate\nfuel rich because this allows lightweight molecules such as hydrogen to remain\nunreacted; this reduces the average molecular mass of the reaction products,\nwhich in turn increases the specific impulse (see Eq. 3-16). For rockets using\nHp and Op propellants the best operating mixture mass ratio for high-performance\nrocket engines is typically between 4.5 and 6.0, not at the stoichiometric value\nof 8.0, because the drop in combustion temperature is small and there is more\nH2 gas (low molecular mass) in the exhaust.\n\nEquation 5-8 is a reversible chemical reaction; by adding energy to the H2O\nthe reaction can be made to go backward to create Hz and O2 and the arrow\nin the equation would be reversed. The decompositions of solid propellants into\nreaction product gases are irreversible chemical reactions, as is the reaction of\n",
    "179": "162 = CHEMICAL ROCKET PROPELLANT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\nliquid propellants burning to create gases. However, reactions among combustion\nproduct gases are usually reversible.\n\nChemical equilibrium exists in reversible chemical reactions when the rate of\nforming products is exactly equal to the reverse reaction of forming reactants from\nthe products. Once this equilibrium is reached, no further changes in concentration\ncan take place. In Equation 5-8 all three gases would be present and their relative\nproportions would depend on the pressure, temperature, and initial mixture.\n\nThe heat of formation AfH \u00b0 is the energy released (or absorbed), or the\nvalue of enthalpy change, when | mol of a chemical compound is formed from\nits constituent atoms or elements at 1 bar (100,000 Pa) and isothermally at\n298.15 K or 25\u00b0C. The A implies that it is an energy change. The subscript\nf refers to formation and the superscript 0 means that each product or reactant\nsubstance is at its thermodynamic standard state and at the reference pressure and\ntemperature. By convention, the heat of formation of the gaseous elements (e.g.,\nHp, Oo, Ar, Xe, etc.) is set to zero at these standard conditions of temperature and\npressure. Typical values of A,;H\u00ae and other properties are given in Table 5-1\nfor selected species. When heat is absorbed in the formation of a product, then\nArH \u00b0 has a positive value. Earlier analyses have been made with the standard\ntemperature at other values, such as 273.15 K and a slightly higher standard\nreference pressure of 1 atm (101, 325 Pa).\n\nThe heat of reaction A-H\u00b0 is the energy released or absorbed when products\nare formed from its reactants at standard reference conditions, namely at 1 bar and\n25\u00b0C. The heat of reaction can be negative or positive, depending on whether the\nreaction is exothermic or endothermic. The heat of reaction at other temperatures\nor pressures has to be corrected in accordance with the change in enthalpy. When\na species changes from one state to another (e.g., liquid becomes gas or vice\nversa), it may lose or gain energy. In most rocket propulsion the heat of reaction\nis determined for a constant-pressure combustion process. In general the heat of\nreaction can be determined from sums of the heats of formation of the products\nand the reactants, namely\n\nA,H? = Y\u00b0[nj(ApH)jIproducts \u2014 Y > [rj (ApH); Ireactants (5-9)\nHere n; is the molar fraction of each particular species j. In a typical rocket\npropellant there are a number of different chemical reactions going on simul-\ntaneously; Eq. 5\u20149 provides the heat of reaction for all of these simultaneous\nreactions. For data on heats of formation and heats of reaction, see Refs. 5\u20147 to\n5-13.\n\nVarious thermodynamic criteria that represent the necessary and sufficient con-\nditions for an equilibrium to be stable were first advanced by J. W. Gibbs early\nin the 20th century; they are based on minimizing the free energy. The Gibbs\nfree energy G (often called the chemical potential) is a convenient derived func-\ntion or property of the state of a chemical material describing its thermodynamic\npotential and is directly related to the internal energy U, the pressure p, molar\nvolume V, enthalpy h, temperature T, and entropy S.

It is another property\nof a material, just like enthalpy or density; only two such independent parameters\nare required to characterize a gas condition. The free energy may be thought of\nas the tendency or driving force for a chemical material to enter into a chemical\n(or physical) change. Although it cannot be measured directly, differences in\nchemical potential can be measured. When the chemical potential of the reactants\nis higher than that of the likely products, a chemical reaction can occur and the\nchemical composition can change. The change in free energy AG for reactions\nat constant temperature and pressure is the chemical potential of the products\nless that of the reactants:\n\nm n\n\nAG = D> [nj (APG); Iproduers \u2014 > [j (Ap); Trcactant (5-12)\n\nj=l j=l\n\nHere the superscript m gives the number of gas species in the combustion\nproducts, the superscript n gives the number of gas species in the reactants, and\nthe AG represents the maximum energy that can be \u201cfreed\u201d to do work on an\n\u201copen\u201d system where mass enters and leaves the system. At equilibrium the free\nenergy is a minimum; at its minimum a small change in mixture fractions causes\nalmost no change in AG, and the free energies of the products and the reactants\nare essentially equal. Then\n\ndAG/dn = 0 (5-13)\nand a curve of molar concentration n versus AG would have a minimum.\n\nIf reacting propellants are liquid or solid materials, energy will be needed to\nchange phase, vaporize them, or break them down into other gaseous species. This\nenergy has to be subtracted from the heat or the energy available to heat the gases\nfrom the reference temperature to the combustion temperature. Therefore, the val-\nues of AH\u00ae and AG\u00b0 for liquid and solid species are different from those of the\nsame species in a gaseous state. The standard free energy of formation A;G\u00b0 is\nthe increment in free energy associated with the reaction of forming a given com-\npound or species from its elements at their reference state.

ANALYSIS OF CHAMBER OR MOTOR CASE CONDITIONS\nThe objectives here are to determine the theoretical combustion temperature\nand the theoretical composition of the resulting reaction products, which in turn\nwill allow the determination of the physical properties of the combustion gases\n(C,.k,e, or other). Before we can make this analysis, some basic data (e.g.,\npropellants, their ingredients, desired chamber pressure, or all likely reaction\nproducts) have to be known or postulated. Although the combustion process\nreally consists of a series of different chemical reactions that occur almost simul-\ntaneously and includes the breakdown of chemical compounds into intermediate\nand subsequently into final products, the analysis is only concerned with the ini-\ntial and final conditions, before and after combustion. We will mention several\n",
    "183": "166 = CHEMICAL ROCKET PROPELLANT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\napproaches to the analysis of chamber conditions. In this section we will first\ngive some definitions of key terms and explain some concepts and principles.\n\nThe first principle concerns the conservation of energy. The heat created by the\ncombustion is equal to the heat necessary to raise the resulting gases adiabatically\nto their final combustion temperature. The heat of reaction of the combustion\nA,+H has to equal the enthalpy change AH of the reaction product gases. The\nenergy balance can be thought of as a two-step process. The chemical reaction\noccurs instantaneously but isothermally at the reference temperature, and the\nresulting energy release then heats the gases from this reference temperature to\nthe final combustion temperature. The heat of reaction, Equation 5\u20149, becomes\n\nn ra n 1\nA,H = ony [ CpdT = Y\u00b0 ny All; (5-18)\n1 ref 1\nHere Ah is the increase in enthalpy for each species multiplied by its molar\nfraction, and C, is the molar specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nThe second principle is the conservation of mass. The mass of any of the\natomic species present in the reactants before the chemical reaction must be\nequal to the mass of the same species in the products. This can be illustrated by\na more general case of the reaction of Equation 5\u20148. In this case the reactants\nare not in stoichiometric proportion.\n\nIn the combustion of hydrogen with oxygen it is possible to form six products:\nwater, hydrogen, oxygen, hydroxyl, atomic oxygen, and atomic hydrogen. In this\ncase all the reactants and products are gaseous. Theoretically, there could be two\nadditional products: ozone O3 and hydrogen peroxide H202; however, these are\nunstable materials that do not readily exist at high temperature, and they can be\nignored. In chemical notation this can be stated by\n\naH + bO2 \u2014 ny,0H20 + ny, H2 + 10,02 + no0A0 + ngH + noHOH (5-19)\nThe left side shows the condition before and the right side the condition after\nthe reaction. Since Hz and O2 can be found on both sides, it means that not all\nof these species are consumed and a portion, namely ny, and no,, will remain\nunreacted. With chemical equilibrium at a particular temperature and pressure\nthe molar concentrations on the right side will remain fixed. Here a, b, ny,0,\nNH,NO,,NO, Ny, and nox are the respective molar quantities of these substances\nbefore and after the reaction, and they can be expressed in kg-mol per kilogram\nof propellant reactants or reaction products. The initial proportions of a and b are\nusually known. The number of kg-mol per kilogram of mixture of each element\ncan be established from this initial mix of oxidizer and fuel ingredients. For the\nhydrogen\u2014oxygen relation above, the mass balances would be\n\nfor hydrogen: 2a = 2ny,0 + 2ny, +H + Non 5-20\nfor oxygen: 2b = ny,0 + 2no, + No + Noun ( )\n",
    "184": "5.2. ANALYSIS OF CHAMBER OR MOTOR CASE CONDITIONS 167\n\nThe mass balance of Eq. 5-20 provides two more equations for this reac-\ntion (one for each atomic species) in addition to the energy balance equation.\nThere are six unknown product percentages and an unknown combustion or\nequilibrium temperature. However, three equations provide a solution for only\nthree unknowns, say the combustion temperature and the molar fractions of two\nof the species. If, for example, it is known that the initial mass mixture ratio of\nb/a is fuel rich, so that the combustion temperature will be relatively low, the\npercentage of remaining O\u00bb and the percentage of the dissociation products (O,\nH, and OH) would all be very low and can be neglected. Thus no, ny, on, and\nNo, are set to be zero. The solution requires knowledge of the enthalpy change\nof each of the species, and that information can be obtained from existing tables,\nsuch as Table 5\u20142 or Refs. 5\u20148 and 5-9.\n\nIn more general form, the mass for any given element must be the same before\nand after the reaction. The number of kg-mol of a given element per kilogram\nof reactants and product is equal, or their difference is zero.

It relies on the minimization of the Gibbs free energy and on mass\nbalance and energy balance equations. As was explained in Eq. 5-12, the change\nin the Gibbs free energy function is zero at equilibrium (AG = 0): the chemical\npotential of the gaseous propellants has to equal that of the gaseous reaction\nproducts, which is Eq. 5-12:\n\nAG = D> Hj AG)produers \u2014 D>) AG) )reactans = 0 (5-23)\nTo assist in solving this equation a Lagrangian multiplier or a factor of the\ndegree of the completion of the reaction is often used. An alternative method\nfor solving for the gas composition, temperature, and gas properties is to use the\nenergy balance (Eq. 5\u201418) together with several mass balances (Eq. 5\u201421) and\nequilibrium constant relationships.\n\nAfter assuming a chamber pressure and setting up the energy balance, mass\nbalances, and equilibrium relations, one method of solving all the equations is to\nestimate a combustion temperature and then solve for the various values of n;.\n",
    "185": "168 = CHEMICAL ROCKET PROPELLANT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\n\nThen a balance has to be achieved between the heat of reaction A,H\u00b0 and the\nheat absorbed by the gases, He - He, to go from the reference temperature to\nthe combustion temperature. If they do not balance, another value of the com-\nbustion temperature is chosen until there is convergence and the energy balances.\n\nThe energy release efficiency, sometimes called the combustion efficiency, can\nnow be defined as the ratio of the actual change in enthalpy per unit propellant\nmixture to the calculated change in enthalpy necessary to transform the propel-\nlants from the initial conditions to the products at the chamber temperature and\npressure. The actual enthalpy change can be evaluated if the initial propellant con-\ndition and the actual composition and the temperature of the combustion gases\nare measured. Experimental measurements of combustion temperature and gas\ncomposition are difficult to perform accurately, and the combustion efficiency is\ntherefore actually evaluated only in rare instances. The combustion efficiency in\nliquid propellant rocket thrust chambers depends on the method of injection and\nmixing and increases with increased combustion temperature. In solid propellants\nthe combustion efficiency is a function of the grain design, the propellant, and the\ndegree of mixing between the several solid constituents. Actual measurements\non well-designed rocket propulsion systems indicate efficiency values of 94 to\n99%. These high values indicate that the combustion is essentially complete, that\nvery little, if any, unreacted propellant remains, and that chemical equilibrium is\nindeed established.\n\nThe number of compounds or species in the exhaust can be 50 or more with\nsolid propellants or with liquid propellants that have certain additives. The num-\nber of nearly simultaneous chemical reactions that have to be considered can\neasily exceed 150. Fortunately, many of these chemical species are present only\nin very small amounts and can usually be neglected.\n\nExample 5-1. Hydrogen peroxide is used both as a monopropellant and as an oxidizer\nin bipropellant systems. It is stored in liquid form and available in various degrees of\ndilution with liquid water. For rocket applications, concentrations (70 to 98*%), known\nas high-test peroxide (HTP) are used. For a monopropellant application, calculate the\nadiabatic flame temperature as a function of water content based on an initial mixture\ntemperature of 298.15 K (the standard condition).\n\nSOLUTION. In this usage, hydrogen peroxide dissociates while passing through a catalyst\nand releases energy which goes to increase the propellant temperature in the absence of\nany heat transfer losses. But some of this heat will be required to evaporate the diluent\nwater. The mass balance, Eq. 5\u201421, is satisfied by 2 mol of hydrogen peroxide in n moles\nof liquid water, producing n + 2 mol of water vapor plus | mol of oxygen gas.

ANALYSIS OF NOZZLE EXPANSION PROCESSES\nThere are several methods for analyzing the nozzle flow, depending on the\nassumptions made for chemical equilibrium, nozzle expansion, particulates, or\nenergy losses. Several are outlined in Table 5\u20143.\n\nOnce the gases reach the nozzle, they experience an adiabatic, reversible\nexpansion process which is accompanied by a major drop in temperature and\npressure and a conversion of thermal energy into kinetic energy. Several increas-\ningly more complicated methods have been used for the analysis of the process.\nFor the simple case of frozen equilibrium and one-dimensional flow the state of\nthe gas throughout expansion in the nozzle is fixed by the entropy of the sys-\ntem, which is presumed to be invariant as the pressure is reduced to the value\nassigned to the nozzle exit plane. All the assumptions listed in Chapter 3 for an\nideal rocket would be valid here. Again, the effects of friction, divergence angle,\nheat losses, shock waves, or nonequilibrium are neglected in the simple cases\nbut are considered in the more sophisticated solutions. The condensed (liquid or\nsolid) phases are similarly assumed to have zero volume and to be in kinetic\nas well as thermal equilibrium with the gas flow. This implies that particles or\ndroplets are very small in size, move at the same velocity as the gas stream, and\nhave the same temperature as the gas at all places in the nozzle.\n\nThe chemical equilibrium during expansion in the nozzle can be analytically\nregarded in the following ways:\n\n1. When the composition is invariant throughout the nozzle, there are no\nchemical reactions or phase changes and the product composition at the\nnozzle exit is identical to that of its chamber condition. The results are\nknown as frozen equilibrium rocket performance. This method usually is\nsimple, but underestimates the performance, typically by 1 to 4%.\n",
    "188": "5.3. ANALYSIS OF NOZZLE EXPANSION PROCESSES 171\n\n2. Instantaneous chemical equilibrium among all molecular species is main-\ntained under the continuously variable pressure and temperature conditions\nof the nozzle expansion process. Thus the product composition shifts; sim-\nilarly, instantaneous chemical reactions, phase changes or equilibria occur\nbetween gaseous and condensed phases of all species in the exhaust gas.\nThe results so calculated are called shifting equilibrium performance. The\ngas composition mass percentages are different in the chamber and the\nnozzle exit. This method usually overstates the performance values, such\nas c* or I,, typically by 1 to 4%. Here the analysis is more complex.\n\n3. Chemical reactions do not occur instantaneously; even though the reac-\ntions occur rapidly, they require a finite time. Reaction rates of specific\nreactions can be estimated; the rates are usually a function of tempera-\nture, the magnitude of deviation from the equilibrium molar composition,\nand the nature of the chemicals or reactions involved. The values of 7,\nc*, or J, for these types of equilibrium analysis usually are between those\nof frozen and instantaneously shifting equilibria. This approach is almost\nnever used because of the lack of good data on reaction rates with multiple\nsimultaneous chemical reactions.\n\nFor an axisymmetric nozzle, both one-and two-dimensional analyses can be\nused. The simplest nozzle flow analysis is one dimensional, which means that\nall velocities and temperatures or pressures are equal at any normal cross section\nof an axisymmetric nozzle. It is often satisfactory for preliminary estimates. In a\ntwo-dimensional analysis the velocity, temperature, density, and/or Mach number\ndo not have a flat profile and vary somewhat over the cross sections. For nozzle\nshapes that are not bodies of revolution (e.g., rectangular, scarfed, or elliptic) a\nthree-dimensional analysis should be performed.\n\nIf solid particles or liquid droplets are present in the nozzle flow and if the\nparticles are larger than about 0.1 lm average diameter, there will be a thermal\nlag and velocity lag. The solid particles or liquid droplets do not expand like\na gas; their temperature decrease depends on losing energy by convection or\nradiation, and their velocity depends on the drag forces exerted on the particle.\nLarger-diameter droplets or particles are not accelerated as rapidly as the smaller\nones and flow at a velocity lower than that of the adjacent accelerating gas. Also,\nthe particulates are hotter than the gas and provide heat to the gas. While these\nparticles contribute to the momentum of the exhaust mass, they are not as efficient\nas an all-gaseous exhaust flow. For composite solid propellants with aluminum\noxide particles in the exhaust gas, the loss due to particles could typically be 1 to\n3%. The analysis of a two- or three-phase flow requires knowledge of an assump-\ntion about the nongaseous matter, the sizes (diameters), size distribution, shape\n(usually assumed to be spherical), optical surface properties (for determining the\nemission/absorption or scattering of radiant energy), and their condensation or\nfreezing temperatures. Some of these parameters are not well known. Performance\nestimates of flows with particles are explained in Section 3.5.\n",

The slowing down of the gas flow near\nthe wall due to the viscous drag actually causes the conversion of kinetic energy\nback into thermal energy, and thus some parts of the boundary layer can be hotter\nthan the local free-stream static temperature. A diagram of a two-dimensional\nboundary layer is shown in Figure 3\u201416. With turbulence this boundary layer\ncan be relatively thick in large-diameter nozzles. The boundary layer is also\ndependent on the axial pressure gradient in the nozzle, the nozzle geometry,\nparticularly in the throat region, the surface roughness, or the heat losses to the\nnozzle walls. Theoretical boundary layer analyses with unsteady flow are only\napproximations, but are expected to improve in the future as our understanding of\nthe phenomena and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are validated.\nThe net effect is a nonuniform velocity and temperature profile, an irreversible\nfriction process in the viscous layers, and therefore an increase in entropy and a\nslight reduction (usually less than 5%) of the kinetic exhaust energy. The layers\nimmediately adjacent to the nozzle walls have laminar and subsonic flow.\n\nAt the high combustion temperatures a small portion of the combustion gas\nmolecules dissociate (split into simpler species); in this dissociation process some\nenergy is absorbed. When energy is released during reassociation (at lower pres-\nsures and temperatures in the nozzle), this reduces the kinetic energy of the\nexhaust gas at the nozzle exit. This is discussed further next.\n\nFor propellants that yield only gaseous products, extra energy is released in\nthe nozzle, primarily from the recombination of free-radical and atomic species,\nwhich become unstable as the temperature is decreased in the nozzle expansion\nprocess. Some propellant products include species that condense as the tem-\nperature drops in the nozzle expansion. If the heat release on condensation is\nlarge, the difference between frozen and shifting equilibrium performance can be\nsubstantial.\n\nIn the simplest method the exit temperature T2 is determined for an isen-\ntropic process (frozen equilibrium) by considering the entropy to be constant.\nThe entropy at the exit is the same as the entropy in the chamber. This deter-\nmines the temperature at the exit and thus the gas condition at the exit. From\nthe corresponding change in enthalpy it is then possible to obtain the exhaust\nvelocity and the specific impulse. For those analysis methods where the nozzle\nflow is not really isentropic and the expansion process is only partly reversible,\nit is necessary to include the losses due to friction, shock waves, turbulence, and\nso on. The result is a somewhat higher average nozzle exit temperature and a\nslight loss in J,. A possible set of steps used for the analysis of nozzle processes\nis given in Table 5\u20143.\n\nWhen the contraction between the combustion chamber (or the port area) and\nthe throat area is small (A,/A, < 3), the acceleration of the gases in the chamber\ncauses a drop in the effective chamber pressure at the nozzle entrance. This\npressure loss in the chamber causes a slight reduction of the values of c and J,.\nThe analysis of this chamber configuration is treated in Ref. 5\u201414 and some data\nare briefly shown in Table 3-2.\n",

Key assumptions for this program are one-dimensional\nforms of the continuity, energy and momentum equations, negligible velocity at\nthe forward end of the combustion chamber, isentropic expansion in the noz-\nzle, ideal gas behavior, and chemical equilibrium in the combustion chamber. It\nincludes options for frozen flow and for narrow chambers (for liquid propellant\ncombustion) or port areas with small cross sections (for solid propellant grains),\nwhere the chamber flow velocities are relatively high, resulting in extra pressure\nlosses and a slight loss in performance. NASA\u2019s CEA code has recently become\npart of a commercial code named Cequel\u2122, which extends the code\u2019s original\ncapabilities.\n\nOther relatively common computer codes used in the United States for ana-\nlyzing the converging\u2014diverging nozzle flow include:\n\nODE (one-dimensional equilibrium code) which features infinitely fast chem-\n\nical reactions (shifting equilibrium) and includes all gaseous constituents.\n\nODK (one-dimensional kinetics) which incorporates finite chemical reaction\n\nkinetic rates for temperature-dependent composition changes in the flow\ndirection with uniform flow properties across any nozzle section. It is used\nas a module in more complex codes and has no provision for particles.\n\nTDK (two-dimensional kinetic code) which incorporates finite kinetic chemical\n\nreaction rates and radial variance in flow properties. It has no provision for\nparticles.\n",
    "193": "176 = CHEMICAL ROCKET PROPELLANT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\nVIPERP (viscous interaction performance evaluation routine for two-phased\nflows) a parabolized Navier-Stokes code for internal two-phased nozzle\nflow with turbulent and nonequilibrium reacting gases. It can be used with\nsolid particles but requires data (or assumptions) on the amount of solids,\nparticle size distribution, or their shape (see, e.g., pp. 503 to 505 in 7th\nEdition).\n\nMore information on these computer codes may be obtained from the appro-\npriate government offices and/or from small companies (who actually run the\nnozzle codes for their customers). Some of the more sophisticated codes are\nproprietary to propulsion organizations and not publicly available.\n\n5.5. RESULTS OF THERMOCHEMICAL CALCULATIONS\n\nExtensive computer results of these machine calculations are available and only a\nfew samples are indicated here to illustrate typical effects of the variations of key\nparameters. In general, high specific impulse or high values of c* can be obtained\nif the average molecular mass of the reaction products is low (usually this implies\na formulation rich in hydrogen) and/or if the available chemical energy (heat of\nreaction) is large, which means high combustion temperatures (see Eq. 3-16).\n\nTable 5\u20144 shows calculated results for a liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen thrust\nchamber taken from an example of this reference. It has shifting equilibrium in\nthe nozzle flow. The narrow chamber has a cross section that is only a little\nlarger than the throat area. The large pressure drop in the chamber (approximately\n126 psi) is due to the energy needed to accelerate the gas, as discussed in Section\n3.3 and Table 3-2.\n\nValues of calculated specific impulse will be higher than those obtained from\nfiring actual propellants in rocket units. In practice it has been found that the\nexperimental values are about 3 to 12% lower than those calculated by the\nmethod explained in this chapter. Because the nozzle inefficiencies explained in\nChapter 3 must be considered, only a portion of this correction (perhaps | to\n4%) is due to combustion inefficiencies.\n\nFigures 5\u20141 to 5\u20146 indicate the results of performance calculations for the liq-\nuid propellant combination, liquid oxygen-RP-1. These data are taken from Refs.\n5-7 and 5-8. The RP-1 fuel is a narrow-cut hydrocarbon similar to kerosene\nwith an average of 1.953 mol of hydrogen for each mole of carbon; thus it has\na nominal formula of CH 953. The calculations are limited to a chamber pres-\nsure of 1000 psia. Most of the curves are for optimum area ratio expansion to\natmospheric pressure, namely | atm or 14.696 psia, and for a limited range of\noxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratios.\n\nFor maximum specific impulse, Figs. 5\u20141 and 5\u20144 show an optimum mixture\nratio of approximately 2.3 (kg/sec of oxidizer flow divided by kg/sec of fuel\nflow) for frozen equilibrium expansion and 2.5 for shifting equilibrium with\ngas expansion to sea-level pressure. The maximum values of c* are at slightly\n",

In gas generators and preburners for staged combustion cycle rocket\nengines (explained in Section 6.6) the gas temperatures are much lower, to avoid\ndamage to the turbine blades. Typically, the combustion reaction gases are at 800\nto 1200 K, which is lower than the gas in the thrust chamber (2900 to 3600 K).\nExamples are listed in Table 5\u201410 for a chamber pressure of 1000 psia. Some\nspecies in the gases will not be present (such as atomic oxygen or hydroxyl),\nand often real gas properties will need to be used because some of these gases\ndo not behave as a perfect gas at these temperatures.\n",

    "211": "CHAPTER 6\nSS\nLIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET\n\nENGINE FUNDAMENTALS\n\nThis chapter gives an overview of liquid propellant rocket engines. It is the first\nof six chapters devoted to this subject. It identifies the types of liquid rocket\nengines, their key components, different propellants, and tank configurations.\nIt also discusses two types of feed systems, engine cycles, propellant tanks,\ntheir pressurization subsystems, engine controls, valves, piping, and structure.\nChapter 7 covers liquid propellants in more detail. Chapter 8 describes thrust\nchambers (and their nozzles), small thrusters, and heat transfer. Chapter 9 is\nabout the combustion process and Chapter 10 discusses turbopumps. Chapter 11\ndiscusses engine design, engine controls, propellant budgets, engine balance and\ncalibration, and overall engine systems.\n\nIn this book a liquid propellant rocket propulsion system consist of a rocket\nengine and a set of tanks for storing and supplying propellants. It has all the\nhardware components and the propellants necessary for its operation, that is, for\nproducing thrust. See Refs. 6-1 and 6\u20142. They are described in this chapter.\nA rocket engine consists of one or more thrust chambers, a feed mechanism\nfor feeding the propellants from their tanks into the thrust chamber(s), a power\nsource to furnish the energy for the feed mechanism, suitable plumbing or piping\nto transfer the liquid propellants, a structure to transmit the thrust force, and\ncontrol devices (including valves) to start and stop and sometimes also vary the\npropellant flow and thus the thrust. Propellants are either pushed out of their\ntanks by high-pressure gas or they are pumped by pumps to the thrust chambers.\nFigure 6\u20141 shows the Space Shuttle main engine, a large sophisticated high-\nperformance liquid propellant rocket engine. The index lists the pages where\ninformation on the Space Shuttle, its main rocket engine, and various components\ncan be found.\n\n194\n",

    "213": "196 LIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINE FUNDAMENTALS\n\nIn some applications rocket engines may also include a thrust vector con-\ntrol system (explained in Chapter 18), a random variable thrust feature (see\nSection 8.5), an engine condition monitoring or engine health monitoring sub-\nsystem (see Section 11.4), and various instrumentation/measuring devices (see\nChapter 21). The tanks, which store the propellants, and the subsystem for pres-\nsurizing the tanks with gas are in this chapter and are considered in this book to\nbe part of the rocket propulsion system.*\n\nThe design of any propulsion system is tailored to fit a specific mission require-\nment as explained in Chapter 19. These requirements are usually stated in terms\nof the application, such as anti-aircraft missile or second stage of a space launch\nvehicle, flight velocity increment, flight path and flight maneuvers, launch sites,\nminimum life (in storage or in orbit), or number of vehicles to be delivered. The\nrequirement usually include constraints of the inert engine weight, cost, or safety\nprovisions. Other criteria, constraints and the selection process are in Chapter 19.\n\nFrom the mission requirements and definition one can derive the propulsion\nsystem and the engine requirements, which include the thrust\u2014time profile, the\nminimum specific impulse, number of thrust chambers, total impulse, number\nof restarts, if any, likely propellants, or constraints of engine masses or engine\nsizes. Some engine parameters, such as thrust, chamber pressure, mixture ratio, or\nnozzle exit area ratio, can be analytically optimized for a specific mission.

Two or\nmore preliminary or conceptual designs can be compared with the objective of\narriving at a selected propulsion design for the mission.\n\nTables 1-3, 11-2, and 11-3 give typical data for selected rocket engines.\nMany different types of rocket engines have been studied, built, and flown, rang-\ning in thrust size from less than 0.01 Ibf to over 1.75 million pounds, with\none-time operation or multiple starts (some have over 150,000 restarts), with or\nwithout thrust modulation (called throttling), single use or reusable, arranged as\nsingle engines, or in clusters of multiple units.\n\nOne way to categorize liquid propellant rocket engines is described in\nTable 6-1. There are two categories, namely those used for boosting a\npayload and imparting a significant velocity increase to a payload and auxiliary\npropulsion for trajectory adjustments and attitude control. Liquid propellant\n*The responsibilities for the design, development, fabrication, and operation of a propulsion system\nare usually shared between a rocket engine organization and a flight vehicle organization. However,\nthe allocations of the responsibilities for components or subsystems have not been rigid or consistent\nin the literature and in actual industry practice. For example, some vehicle design/development\norganizations have considered the tanks and parts of the engine structure to be really a part of their\nvehicle. The tank pressurization system has in various scenarios been considered to be part of either\nthe engine, the propulsion system, or the vehicle. For some reaction control systems the vehicle\ndeveloper often assumed the responsibility for the propulsion systems and obtained only the small\nthrusters and their small propellant valves from a rocket engine company. In some programs, such as\nthe peacekeeper missile fourth stage, the rocket engine developer has developed not only the engine,\nbut also much of the vehicle stage with its propellant tanks and pressurization system.\n",

A thrust chamber has three major parts: an injector,\na combustion chamber, and a nozzle. In a cooled thrust chamber, one of the\npropellants (usually the fuel) is circulated through cooling jackets or a special\ncooling passage to absorb the heat that is transferred from the hot reaction gases\nto the thrust chamber walls (see Figs. 8\u20142 and 8-9). A radiation-cooled thrust\nchamber uses a special high-temperature material, such as niobium metal, which\ncan radiate away its excess heat. There are uncooled or heat-absorbing thrust\nchambers, such as those using ablative materials. Thrust chambers are discussed\nin Chapter 8.\n\nThere are two types of feed systems used for liquid propellant rocket engines:\nthose that use pumps for moving the propellants from their flight vehicle tanks to\nthe thrust chamber and those that use high-pressure gas for expelling or displacing\ntheir propellants from their tanks. They are discussed further in Chapter 10 and\nin Section 6.3.\n\nTables 19-1 to 19-4 compare the advantages and disadvantages of liquid\npropellant rocket engines and solid propellant rocket motors.\n\n6.1.

Fuel (kerosene, alcohol, liquid hydrogen, etc.)\n\n3. Chemical compound or mixture of oxidizer and fuel ingredients, capable\n\nof self-decomposition, such as hydrazine\n\n4.

They\nare the most common type. They are stored separately and are not mixed outside\nthe combustion chamber. A hypergolic bipropellant combination is self-igniting\nupon contact between the oxidizer and the fuel. A nonhypergolic bipropellant\ncombination needs energy to start its combustion (e.g., heat or electric discharge)\nand its engine needs an ignition system.\n",
    "216": "6.1. TYPES OF PROPELLANTS 199\n\nA monopropellant contains an oxidizing agent and combustible matter in a\nsingle substance. It may be a mixture of several compounds or it may be a\nhomogeneous material, such as hydrogen peroxide or hydrazine. Monopropel-\nlants are stable at ordinary atmospheric conditions but decompose and yield hot\ncombustion gases when heated or catalyzed.\n\nA cold gas propellant (e.g., gaseous nitrogen or air) is stored at ambient\ntemperature but at very high pressure, gives a low performance, allows a simple\nsystem, and is usually very reliable. It has been used for roll control and attitude\ncontrol.\n\nA cryogenic propellant is liquified gas at low temperature, such as liquid oxy-\ngen (\u2014183\u00b0C) or liquid hydrogen (\u2014253\u00b0C). Provisions for venting the storage\ntank and minimizing vaporization losses are necessary with this type.\n\nStorable propellants (e.g., nitric acid or gasoline) are liquid at ambient temper-\nature and at modest pressure and can be stored for long periods in sealed tanks.\nSpace-storable propellants are liquid in the environment of space; this storability\ndepends on the specific tank design, thermal conditions, and tank pressure. An\nexample is ammonia.\n\nA gelled propellant is a thixotropic liquid with a gelling additive. It behaves\nlike a jelly or thick paint. It will not spill or leak readily, can flow under pressure,\nwill burn, and is safer in some respects. It is described at the end of Chapter 7.\nGelled propellants have been used in a few experimental rocket engines.\n\nA hybrid propellant usually has a liquid oxidizer and a solid fuel. It is dis-\ncussed in Chapter 16.\n\nThe propellant mixture ratio for a bipropellant is the ratio at which the oxidizer\nand fuel are mixed and react to give hot gases. The mixture ratio r is defined as\nthe ratio of the oxidizer mass flow rate 7) and the fuel mass flow rate my or\n\nr =o /iy (6-1)\n\nAs explained in Chapter 5 the mixture ratio defines the composition and tem-\nperature of the combustion or reaction products. It is usually chosen to give a\nmaximum value of specific impulse or 7;/20, where T; is the absolute combus-\ntion temperature and 9 is the average molecular mass of the reaction gases (see\nEq. 3-16 or Fig. 3-2). For a given thrust F and a given effective exhaust veloc-\nity c, the total propellant flow is given by Eq. 2\u20146; namely, m = w/go = F/c.\nThe relationships between r, m, 1M, and my are\n\nMo + my =m (6-2)\nMy =rm/(r + 1) (6-3)\nmp =m/(r + 1) (6-4)\n\nThese same four equations are valid when w and w (weight and weight flow\n\nrate) are substituted for m and m.

Hydrogen is unique and in its\nliquid state has a very low density.\n6.2. PROPELLANT TANKS\nIn liquid bipropellant rocket engine systems the propellants are usually stored in\nan oxidizer tank and a fuel tank within the flying vehicle. Monopropellant rocket\nengine systems have, of course, only one propellant tank. There are usually\nalso one or more high-pressure gas tanks, the gas being used to pressurize the\npropellant tanks. However, as will be discussed in Section 6.5, there are tank\npressurization schemes using heated gas from the engine without the need for\na high-pressure heavy gas storage tank. Tanks can be arranged in a variety of\nways, and the tank design, shape, and location can be used to exercise some\ncontrol over the change in the location of the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity. Typical\narrangements are shown in Fig. 6\u20142. Because the propellant tank has to fly,\nits mass is at a premium and the tank material is therefore highly stressed.\nCommon tank materials are aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, alloy steel, and\nfiber-reinforced plastics with an impervious thin inner liner of metal to prevent\nleakage through the pores of the fiber-reinforced walls. Chapter 8 of Ref. 6-1\ndescribes the design of propellant tanks.\nThe extra volume of gas above the propellant in sealed tanks is called ullage.\nIt is necessary space that allows for thermal expansion of the propellant liquids,\nfor the accumulation of gases that were originally dissolved in the propellant,\nor for gaseous products from slow reactions within the propellant during stor-\nage. Depending on the storage temperature range, the propellants\u2019 coefficient of\nthermal expansion, and the particular application, the ullage volume is usually\nbetween 3 and 10% of the tank volume. Once propellant is loaded into a tank,\nthe ullage volume (and, if it is sealed, also its pressure) will change as the bulk\ntemperature of the propellant varies.\nThe expulsion efficiency of a tank and/or propellant piping system is the\namount of propellant expelled or available for propulsion divided by the total\namount of propellant initially present. Typical values are 97 to 99.7%. The losses\n",

This residual propellant is not available for combustion and\nmust be treated as inert mass, causing the vehicle mass ratio to decrease slightly.\nIn the design of tanks and piping systems, an effort is made to minimize the\nresidual propellant.\n\nThe optimum shape of a propellant tank (and also a gas pressurizing tank) is\nspherical because for a given volume it results in a tank with the least weight.\nSmall spherical tanks are often used with reaction control engine systems, where\nthey can be packaged with other vehicle equipment. Unfortunately, the larger\nspheres, which are needed for the principal propulsion systems, are not very\nefficient for using the space in a flight vehicle. These larger tanks are often made\nintegral with the vehicle fuselage or wing. Most are cylindrical with half ellipses\nat the ends, but they can be irregular in shape. A more detailed discussion of\ntank pressurization is given in Section 6.5.\n\nCryogenic propellants cool the tank wall temperature far below the ambient\nair temperature. This causes condensation of moisture from the air on the outside\nof the tank and usually also formation of ice during the period prior to launch.\nThe ice is undesirable because it increases the vehicle inert mass. Also, as pieces\n",
    "220": "6.2. PROPELLANT TANKS 203\nof ice are shaken off or break off during the initial flight, these pieces can damage\nthe vehicle; for example, the ice from the Shuttle\u2019s cryogenic tank can hit the\norbiter vehicle.\n\nFor an extended storage period, cryogenic tanks are usually thermally insu-\nlated; porous external insulation layers have to be sealed to prevent moisture from\nbeing condensed inside the insulation layer. With liquid hydrogen it is possible\nto liquify or solidify the ambient air on the outside of the fuel tank. Even with\nheavy insulation and low-conductivity structural tank supports, it is not possible\nto prevent the continuous evaporation of the cryogenic fluid. Even with good\nthermal insulation, all cryogenic propellants evaporate slowly during storage and\ntherefore cannot be kept in a vehicle for more than perhaps a week without\nrefilling of the tanks. For vehicles that need to be stored or to operate for longer\nperiods, a storable propellant combination is preferred.\n\nPrior to loading very cold cryogenic propellant into a flight tank, it is necessary\nto remove or evacuate the air to avoid forming solid air particles or condensing\nany moisture as ice. These frozen particles would plug up injection holes, cause\nvalves to freeze shut, or prevent valves from being fully closed. Tanks, piping, and\nvalves need to be chilled or cooled down before they can contain cryogenic liquid\nwithout excessive bubbling. This is usually done by letting an initial amount of\ncryogenic liquid absorb the heat from the relatively warm hardware prior to\nengine start. This initial cool-down propellant is vaporized and vented through\nappropriate vent valves and cannot be used for propulsion.\n\nIf the tank or any segment of piping containing low-temperature cryogenic\nliquid is sealed for an extended period of time, heat from ambient-temperature\nhardware will result in evaporation, and this will greatly raise the pressure\nuntil it exceeds the strength of the container (see Ref. 6\u20143). Controlled self-\npressurization can be difficult to achieve. Uncontrolled self-pressurization will\ncause a failure, usually a major leak or even a tank explosion. All cryogenic\ntanks and piping systems are therefore vented during storage on the launch pad,\nequipped with pressure safety devices (such as burst diaphragms or relief valves),\nand the evaporated propellant is allowed to escape from its container. For long-\nterm storage of cryogenic propellants in space vacuum (or on the ground) some\nform of a powered refrigeration system is needed to recondense the vapors and\nminimize evaporation losses. The tanks are usually refilled or topped off just\nbefore launch to replace the evaporated and vented cool-down propellant. When\nthe tank is pressurized, just before launch, the boiling point is usually raised\nslightly and the cryogenic liquid can usually absorb the heat transferred to it\nduring the several minutes of rocket firing.\n\nThere are several categories of tanks in liquid propellant propulsion systems.\nThere are a few exceptions to the pressure values listed below.\n\n1. For pressurized feed systems the propellant tanks typically operate at an\n\naverage pressure between 1.3 and 9 MPa or about 200 to 1800 Ibf/in.?\nThese tanks have thick walls and are heavy.\n",
    "221": "204 \u2014_ LIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINE FUNDAMENTALS\n2. For high-pressure gas (used to expel the propellants) the tank pressures are\nmuch higher, typically between 6.9 and 69 MPa or 1000 to 10,000 Ibf/in.?.\nThese tanks are usually spherical for minimum inert mass. Several small\nspherical tanks can be connected together, and then they are relatively easy\nto place within the confined space of a vehicle.\n\n3. For turbopump feed systems it is necessary to pressurize the propellant\n\ntanks slightly (to suppress pump cavitation as explained in Sections 10.3\nand 10.4) to average values of between 0.07 and 0.34 MPa or 10 to 50\nIbf/in?. These low pressures allow thin tank walls, and therefore turbopump\nfeed systems have relatively low inert tank weights.\n\nLiquid propellant tanks can be difficult to empty under side accelerations,\nzero-g, or negative-g conditions during flight. Special devices and special types\nof tanks are needed to operate under these conditions. Some of the effects that\nhave to be overcome are described below.\n\nThe oscillations and side accelerations of vehicles in flight can cause sloshing\nof the liquid in the tank, very similar to a glass of water that is being jiggled. In\nan anti-aircraft missile, for example, the side accelerations can be large and can\ninitiate severe sloshing. Typical analysis of sloshing can be found in Refs. 6-4\nand 6-5. When the tank is partly empty, sloshing can uncover the tank outlet\nand allow gas bubbles to enter into the propellant discharge line. These bubbles\ncan cause major combustion problems in the thrust chambers; the aspirating\nof bubbles or the uncovering of tank outlets by liquids therefore needs to be\navoided. Sloshing also causes shifts in the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity and makes\nflight control difficult.\n\nVortexing can also allow gas to enter the tank outlet pipe; this phenomenon\nis similar to the Coriolis force effects in bath tubs being emptied and can be\naugmented if the vehicle spins or rotates in fight. Typically, a series of internal\nbaffles is often used to reduce the magnitude of sloshing and vortexing in tanks\nwith modest side accelerations. A positive expulsion mechanism can prevent gas\nfrom entering the propellant piping under multidirectional major accelerations\nor spinning (centrifugal) acceleration. Both the vortexing and sloshing can also\ngreatly increase the unavailable or residual propellant, and thus cause a reduction\nin vehicle performance.\n\nIn the gravity-free environment of space, the stored liquid will float around\nin a partly emptied tank and may not always cover the tank outlet, thus allow-\ning gas to enter the tank outlet or discharge pipe. Figure 6-3 shows that gas\nbubbles have no orientation. Various devices have been developed to solve this\nproblem: namely, positive expulsion devices and surface tension devices. The\npositive expulsion tank design includes movable pistons, inflatable flexible blad-\nders, or thin movable, flexible metal diaphragms. Surface tension devices rely on\nsurface tension forces to keep the outlet covered with liquid.\n\nSeveral basic types of positive expulsion devices have been used successfully\nin propellant tanks of pressurized feed systems. They are compared in Table 6-2\n",

These devices mechanically separate\nthe pressurizing gas from the liquid propellant in the propellant tank. Separation\nis useful for these reasons:\n\n1. It prevents pressurizing gas from dissolving in the propellant and propellant\nfrom evaporating. Dissolved pressurizing gas dilutes the propellant, reduces\nits density as well as its specific impulse, and makes the pressurization\ninefficient.\n\n2. It allows moderately hot and reactive gases (such as gas generated by gas\ngenerators) to be used for pressurization, and this permits a reduction in\npressurizing system mass and volume. The mechanical separation prevents\na chemical reaction between the hot gas and the propellant, prevents gas\nfrom being dissolved in the propellant, and reduces the heat transfer to the\nliquid.\n\n3. In some cases tanks containing toxic propellant must be vented without\nspilling any toxic liquid propellant or its vapor. For example, in servicing\na reusable rocket, the tank pressure needs to be relieved without venting\nor spilling potentially hazardous material.\n",

This is\nimportant in rockets with high side accelerations such as anti-aircraft missiles or\nspace defense missiles, where the thrust vector needs to go through the vehicle\u2019s\nCG; if the CG is not well known, unpredictable turning moments may be imposed\non the vehicle. A piston also prevents sloshing or vortexing.\n\nSurface tension devices use capillary attraction for supplying liquid propellant\nto the tank outlet pipe. These devices (see Fig. 6\u20143) are often made of very\nfine (300 mesh) stainless steel wire woven into a screen and formed into tunnels\nor other shapes (see Refs. 6\u20146 and 6-7). These screens are located near the\ntank outlet and, in some tanks, the tubular galleries are designed to connect\nvarious parts of the tank volume to the outlet pipe sump. These devices work\nbest in a relatively low-acceleration environment, when surface tension forces\ncan overcome the inertia forces.\n\nThe combination of surface tension screens, baffles, sumps, and traps is called\na propellant management device. Although not shown in any detail, they are\nincluded inside the propellant tanks of Figs. 6\u20143 and 6-13.\n",
    "225": "208 \u2014_ LIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINE FUNDAMENTALS\nHigh forces can be imposed on the tanks and thus on the vehicle by strong\nsloshing motions of the liquid and also by sudden changes in position of liquid\nmass in a partly empty tank during a gravity-free flight when suddenly accelerated\nby a relatively large thrust. These forces can be large and can cause tank failure.\nThe forces will depend on the tank geometry, baffles, ullage volume, and its\ninitial location and the acceleration magnitude and direction.\n6.3. PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS\nThe propellant feed system has two principal functions: to raise the pressure of\nthe propellants and to feed them at predicted mass flow rates to one or more thrust\nchambers. The energy for these functions comes either from a high-pressure gas,\ncentrifugal pumps, or a combination of the two. The selection of a particular feed\nsystem and its components is governed primarily by the application of the rocket,\nthe requirements mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, duration, number or\ntype of thrust chambers, past experience, mission, and by general requirements\nof simplicity of design, ease of manufacture, low cost, and minimum inert mass.\nA classification of several of the more important types of feed system is shown\nin Fig. 6\u20145, and some are discussed in more detail in other parts of this book. All\nfeed systems have piping, a series of valves, provisions for filling and usually also\nLiquid propellant\nfeed systems\npressurization within tank pressurization jf {| and gas discharge\nMulti-stage Single stage\nBy stored By vaporized | [ By chemically impellers impeller\n\u2018Small portion of one One pump Two main Warm Hot gas bleed\npropellant flow raised to | | each for fuel| | pumps plus two hydrogen from main\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 precombustor pressure | | and oxidizer| | booster pumps from cooling combustion\nwith additional impeller SF chamber\nRegulated\nWi gas Diven by Roh pressure\n\u2014\u2014 turbine liquid propellant (for Flow through Flow through\n\u2014r\u2014 booster pumps only) turbines in turbines in\nseries parallel\naoe\n\u2018One turbine drives Two turbines; one Four turbines; two Exhaust overboard Exhaust feeds Exhaust into\nboth fuel and for fuel pump, one | __|for main pumps, two with low area into diverging injector of\noxidizer pumps for oxidizer pump for booster pumps ratio nozzle nozzle section main combustor\ntransmission \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFIGURE 6-5.

See Ref. 6-1.\n\nIn general, a gas pressure feed system gives a vehicle performance superior\nto a turbopump system when the total impulse or the mass of propellant is\nrelatively low, the chamber pressure is low, the engine thrust-to-weight ratio is\nlow (usually less than 0.6), and when there are repeated short-duration thrust\npulses; the heavy-walled tanks for the propellant and the pressurizing gas usually\nconstitute the major inert mass of the engine system. In a turbopump feed system\nthe propellant tank pressures are much lower (by a factor of 10 to 40) and thus the\nvehicle\u2019s tank masses are much lower (again by a factor of 10 to 40). Turbopump\nsystems usually give a superior vehicle performance when the total impulse is\nlarge (higher Aw) and the chamber pressure is higher.\n\nLocal Pressures and Flows\n\nKey parameters of any feed system and any liquid propellant rocket engine are\nthe flow magnitudes and the local pressures of the pressurizing gas subsystem,\nthe oxidizer, and the fuel flow subsystem including the flow passages of thrust\nchambers. An inspection of the flow diagram of a relatively simple rocket engine\nwith a pressurized feed system, similar to Fig. 1-3, shows that the gas flow splits\ninto two branches, and the propellant flow splits into pipes leading to each of the\nthrust chambers. The highest pressure is in the high-pressure gas supply tank. The\npressure drops in the pressurizing gas subsystem (pipes, valves, regulator) and\nthen drops further in the liquid propellant flow subsystems (more pipes, valves,\nfilters, injector, or cooling jacket) and the flows go into the thrust chamber, where\nthe propellants burn at chamber pressure. The pressure reaches a minimum at the\nnozzle exit. If enough information is known about the geometric details and\nfunctions of the components and their flow passages, then it has been possible\nto use computer programs to obtain these pressure drops and flow distributions.\nIf this analysis can be validated by data from previous pertinent tests, it will be\nmore useful. Many rocket engine design organizations have developed their own\ncomputer programs for estimating pressures and flows in different parts of an\nengine.\n\nAnalyzing and knowing the local branch flows and local pressures is important\nfor the following reasons:\n\n1. They are used in the stress analysis and sometimes in the thermal analysis\n\nof components and subsystems.\n\n2. They are needed in the calibration of the rocket engine, so that this engine\n\nwill operate at the intended mixture ratio, chamber pressure, or thrust.\nThis is accomplished by using control devices or simple orifices to adjust\nthe pressures. This calibration also requires the proper balance of flows\nand pressures. For a feed system with one or more turbopumps, such as\nthe one in Fig. 1-4, one needs to also include the rise in pressure as\npropellants flow through a pump. Furthermore there is another combustion\n",
    "227": "210 \u2014_ LIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINE FUNDAMENTALS\ndevice (gas generator or preburner) or alternatively the evaporation of a\ncryogenic propellant in a cooling jacket, and this makes the feed system\nwith turbopumps more complex. A more detailed discussion of engine\ncalibration is given in Section 11.5.\n\n3. Measuring the actual flows and several key local pressures during engine\nground tests or actual flight operation and then comparing these actual\nvalues with the calculated or predicted values makes is possible to iden-\ntify discrepancies between practice and theory. Such discrepancies give\nclues to possible malfunction, inadequate design, or poor fabrication, which\ncan then be identified and probably corrected. If the real measured values\ncan be compared with the analysis values in real time, some experimental\ntest hardware can be saved from self-destruction. This can be the basis\nfor a real-time engine health monitoring system, which is discussed in\nSection 11.4.\n\nSome of the analyses are aimed at transient conditions, such as during the start\nperiod, the shutdown period, or the change in thrust value (throttling). These tran-\nsient analyses provide for the filling of empty propellant passages with propellant,\nfor different propellant temperatures, water hammer, valve reaction time, and the\nlike.\n\n6.4. GAS PRESSURE FEED SYSTEMS\n\nOne of the simplest and most common means of pressurizing the liquid pro-\npellants is to force them out of their respective tanks by displacing them with\nhigh-pressure gas. Rocket engines with pressurized gas feed systems can be very\nreliable. References 6\u20141, 6-8, and 6\u20149 give additional information. A rocket\nengine with a gas-pressurized feed system was the first to be tested and flown\n(1926). Since then there have been two common types of pressurized feed sys-\ntems and both are still used often today. The first uses a gas pressure regulator\nin the gas feed line and its engine operates at essentially constant tank pressure\nand nearly constant thrust.\n\nIt is shown schematically in Fig. 1\u20143 and consists of a high-pressure gas tank,\na gas starting valve, a pressure regulator, propellant tanks, propellant valves,\nand feed lines. Additional components, such as filling and draining provisions,\ncheck valves, filters, flexible elastic bladders for separating the liquid from the\npressurizing gas, and pressure sensors or gauges, are also often incorporated.\nAfter all tanks are filled, the high-pressure gas valve in Fig. 1-3 is remotely\nactuated and admits gas through the pressure regulator at a constant pressure to\nthe propellant tanks. The check valves prevent mixing of the oxidizer with the\nfuel, particularly when the unit is not in an upright position. The propellants are\nfed to the thrust chamber by opening appropriate valves. When the propellants\nare completely consumed, the pressurizing gas can also scavenge and clean lines\nand valves of much of the liquid propellant residue. The variations in this system,\nsuch as the combination of several valves into one or the elimination and addition\n",
    "228": "6.4. GAS PRESSURE FEED SYSTEMS 211\nof certain components, depend to a large extent on the application. If a unit is to\nbe used and flown repeatedly, such as a space-maneuver rocket, it will include\nseveral additional features such as, possibly, a thrust-regulating device and a tank\nlevel gauge; they will not be found in an expendable, single-shot unit, which may\nnot even have a tank-drainage provision.\n\nThe second common type of gas pressure feed system is called a blow-down\nfeed system. It is shown in Fig. 6\u20146 and discussed in Ref. 6-10. Here the\npropellant tanks are enlarged because they store not only the propellants but also\nthe pressurizing gas at the initial maximum propellant tank pressure. There is no\nseparate high-pressure gas tank and no pressure regulator. The expansion of the\ngas already in the tanks provides for the expulsion of the propellants from their\ntanks. The blow-down system can be lighter than a regulated pressure system, but\nthe thrust and the pressures decrease steadily as the propellants are consumed. A\ncomparison of these two common types is shown in Table 6-3.\n\nDifferent bipropellant pressurization concepts are evaluated in Refs. 6-1, 6-8,\n6-9, and 6-10. Table 6-4 lists various optional features aimed at satisfying\nparticular design goals. Many of these features also apply to pump-fed systems,\nwhich are discussed in Section 6.6. Many feed systems or engines have some,\nbut certainly not all, of the features listed in Table 6\u20144. With monopropellants\nthe gas pressure feed system becomes simpler since there is only one propellant\nand not two, reducing the number of pipes, valves, and tanks.\n\nal a\nfill ara 2) e = Gauge (2)\n_ \u2014__\u2014\u2014\u2014 Pressurized gas is stored\n<|__ inside the propellant tanks\nFuel \u2014 Oxidizer (only about 2/3 full)\n\u2014\nPropellant tanks (2)\n0 {+ Fill and drain valve (2)\nba bd.\nL I ~\u2014~ Valve (2)\n= Ej ~<\u2014 Filter (2)\nIs XX\nGauge (2) @ K \u00ae K Two thrusters with\nduel propellant valves\nFIGURE 6-6.

Figures 6-7 and 6-8 and Table 6-5 refer to\none of the aft pods only and show a combined OMS and RCS arrangement.\nThe OMS provides thrust for orbit insertion, orbit circularization, orbit transfer,\nrendezvous, deorbit, and abort. The RCS provides thrust for attitude control (in\npitch, yaw, and roll) and for small-vehicle velocity corrections or changes in\nalmost any direction (translation maneuvers), such as are needed for rendezvous\nand docking; it can operate simultaneously with or separate from the OMS.\nThe systems feature various redundancies, an automatic RCS thruster selec-\ntion system, various safety devices, automatic controls, sensors to allow a display\nto the shuttle\u2019s crew of the system\u2019s status and health, and manual command\noverrides. The reliability requirements are severe. Several key components, such\nas all the helium pressure regulators, propellant tanks, some valves, and about\nhalf the thrusters are duplicated and redundant; if one fails, another can still\ncomplete the mission.

    "234": "6.5. TANK PRESSURIZATION 217\n6.5. TANK PRESSURIZATION\nAs was stated before the objective of feed systems is to move the propellants\nunder pressure from the propellant tanks to the thrust chamber(s). The tank pres-\nsurization system is that part of the feed system that provides a gas to expel\npropellants from the tanks. See Refs. 6\u20141, 6-8, 6\u20149, and 6\u201410. As was described\nin Section 6.3 there are two types: (1) in a pressurized gas feed system a rel-\natively high pressure gas displaces the propellants from the tanks and (2) in a\npumped feed system (described in the next section) the main energy for feeding\nthe propellants comes from one or more pumps, but it requires a low gas pressure\nin the tanks to move the propellants to the pump inlet in order to avoid pump\ncavitation.\n\nThere are several sources of pressurizing gas commonly used in tank pressur-\n\nization systems.\n\n1. High-pressure inert gas stored at ambient temperature is the most common.\nTypical gases are helium, nitrogen, or air. Table 6-3 shows a comparison\nof the regulated pressure system (see Fig. 1-3) and the blow-down system\n(see Fig. 6\u20146). It is discussed further in this section. As the gas expands,\nits temperature drops.\n\n2. Heated high-pressure inert gas (typically 200 to 800\u00b0F or 93 to 427\u00b0C)\nreduces the amount of required gas mass and thus the inert mass of the\npressurizing system. Examples are gas heated by a heat exchanger with\nwarm gas from a gas generator, with warm gas from turbine exhaust, or\nwith electrical heaters inside the gas tank. Reference 6-12.\n\n3. Gas is created by a chemical reaction by using either liquid bipropellants\nor a monopropellant and alternatively by a solid propellant, all at mixture\nratios that allow a low enough or \u201cwarm\u201d gas reaction temperature, so\nuncooled hardware can be used. The term \u201cwarm gas\u201d (say 400 to 1600\u00b0F\nor 204 to 871\u00b0C) is used here to distinguish it from the hot gas (4000 to\n6000\u00b0F, or 2204 to 3319\u00b0C) in the main combustion chamber. This chem-\nically generated warm gas usually results in a lighter tank pressurization\nsystem than the heated inert gas system, particularly for applications with a\nhigh total impulse. This gas can come from two separate small gas genera-\ntors for tank pressurization; one produces fuel-rich gas for pressurizing the\nfuel tank and the other feeds oxidizer-rich pressurizing gas into the oxidizer\ntank. This scheme was first used in the United States on the Bomarc rocket\nengine around 1952 and on the Russian RD-253 around 1961. The other\ncommon warm-gas scheme is to bleed a small amount of warm gas from the\nengine\u2019s gas generator or preburner. If this gas is fuel rich, then it can only\nbe used for pressurizing the fuel tank, and it may need to be cooled. These\nchemical reaction gases typically are at 1200 to 1700\u00b0F or 649 to 921\u00b0C,\nwhich are within the gas temperatures allowable for most alloy turbines and\nsteel tanks. Catalyzed decomposed hydrazine warm gaseous reaction prod-\nucts have successfully pressurized liquid hydrazine tanks. With aluminum\n",

This cooling of gas has been\naccomplished by using a heat exchanger with one of the propellants. Solid\npropellant gas generators have been used on experimental liquid propellant\nrocket engines, but as far as the author can determine, none have been\nadapted for a production flight vehicle. One clever system developed in\nthe former Soviet Union uses two rocket engines operating simultaneously\non the same vehicle. The larger engine has a bleed of oxidixer-rich gases\nfrom an oxidizer-rich preburner for pressurizing the common oxidizer tank.\nThe second engine feeds four smaller hinge-mounted vernier thrust cham-\nbers, which hare been used for attitude control and also for extra thrust;\nits fuel-rich gas generator has a bleed of gas for pressurizing the common\nfuel tank. See Ref. 6-12.\n\n4. Evaporate a flow of a cryogenic liquid propellant, usually liquid hydrogen,\nby applying heat usually taken from a thrust chamber cooling jacket and\nthen use a part or all of this evaporated flow for tank pressurization. Orifices\nor pressure regulators may be needed to control the desired tank pressure.\nThis scheme is used for the fuel tank of the Space Shuttle Main Engine and\nthe tap-off stub for pressurizing gas can be seen in Fig. 6\u201412 in the turbine\nexhaust manifold of the fuel booster pump. The oxygen tank is pressurized\nby gasified liquid oxygen, which was tapped off the discharge side of the\nmain oxygen pump and heated in a heat exchanger around the turbine of\nthe main oxygen pump, as shown in Figure 6\u201412. See Ref. 6-12.\n\n5. Direct injection of a small stream of hypergolic fuel into the main oxidizer\ntank and a small flow of oxidizer into the fuel tank has been tried in several\ncountries without success. It is really a form of chemical gas generation.\nThe only successful flight application is reported to be with a Russian\nICBM upper stage engine using hypergolic propellants. See Refs. 6\u20141 and\n6-12.\n\n6. Self-pressurization of cryogenic propellants by evaporation is feasible but\ncan be difficult to control (see Ref. 6-3). Experience is limited.\n\nIn order to design or analyze a pressurizing system it is necessary to know\nor to assume certain data about the tank and the engine. This can include the\nbasic engine parameters, such as the propellant flow, thrust, duration, pulse width,\npropellant tank volume, percent ullage of that volume, storage temperature range,\npropellant and pressurizing gas properties, propellant tank pressure, gas tank\npressure, or amount of unavailable residual propellant. For many of these the\nnominal, maximum, and minimum values may be needed.\n\nFactors Influening the Required Mass of Pressurizing Gas\n\nA key task in the analysis and design of tank pressurization systems is determining\nthe required mass of pressurizing gas. Many different factors influence this gas\nmass, and some of them can be quite complex as shown in Ref. 6\u20141. Therefore\n",
    "236": "6.5. TANK PRESSURIZATION 219\na basic analysis of the amount of pressurizing gas for a new propulsion system\nis usually not accurate or fully useful. The mass of gas can be estimated using\nsimplifying assumptions, but it is more accurate if it is based on actual test\nresults and/or data from similar proven pressurizing systems. These are some of\nthe influencing factors:\n\n1. Evaporation of propellant at the interface between the pressurizing gas\nand the liquid propellant is a key phenomenon. The evaporated propellant dilutes\nthe gas and changes its properties and expansion behavior. It depends on the\ntemperature difference between the gas and the liquid, sloshing, vapor pressure\nof the propellant, turbulence, and local velocities of the gas. Furthermore the\nfilm of propellant on those portions of the tank walls and baffles, which are\nabove the liquid level, will also evaporate. \u201cWarm\u201d gases (e.g., a bleed from a\ngas generator) will cause heating of the top layer of the liquid propellant and\nincrease propellant evaporation. With cryogenic propellants the gas is always\nwarmer than the liquid. The gas is cooled and more liquid evaporates.\n\n2. The temperature of those walls of the propellant tanks, which are part of the\nexterior vehicle surface, can be affected by aerodynamic heating, which varies\nduring the flight. This heat can increase the gas temperature as well as the liquid\npropellant temperature, and can augment the liquid evaporation.\n\n3. The solubility of the gas in the liquid is affected by temperature and pres-\nsure. For example, nitrogen gas is soluble in liquid oxygen. It requires four times\nas much nitrogen gas to pressurize liquid oxygen as an equivalent volume of\nwater. This dilutes the oxygen and causes a small performance loss. Helium is\nnot very soluble in oxygen.\n\n4. Condensation of certain species of the gas can dilute the propellant. Water\nvapor in warm gases is an example. Condensation can also occur on the exposed\nwetted inner walls of the propellant tanks and this requires more pressurizing\ngas.\n\n5. Changes in the gas temperature take place during the operation. The com-\npressed gas undergoes an expansion that can cause a dramatic cooling of the gas.\nTemperatures as low as 160 to 200 K (\u2014228 to \u2014100\u00b0F) have been recorded\nwith helium. The cold gas absorbs heat from the propellants and the engine\nhardware. The particular expansion process will depend largely on the time of\nrocket operation. For large liquid propellant rocket engines, which run only for\na few minutes, the expansion process will be close to adiabatic, which means\nlittle heat transfer from the hardware to the gas. For satellites, which stay in\norbits for years and where the thrusters operate only occasionally for short oper-\nating periods, heat will be transferred from the vehicle hardware to the gas\nand the process will be close to an isothermal expansion (no change in tempe-\nrature).\n\n6. Chemical reactions of some species of the pressurizing gas with the liquid\npropellant have occurred and some can generate heat. Inert gases, such as helium,\nhave no chemical reactions with the propellants.\n",
    "237": "220 LIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINE FUNDAMENTALS\n\n7. Turbulence and irregular flow distribution of the entering gas will increase\nthe heat transfer between the liquid and the gas. Depending on the temperature\ndifference, it can cause additional heating or cooling of the top liquid layers.\n\n8. Vigorous sloshing can quickly change the gas temperature. In some of\nthe experimental flights of the Bomarc missile the side accelerations induced\nsloshing, which caused a sudden cooling of the warm tank pressurizing gas and\ncaused a sudden reduction of tank pressure and propellant flow. See Refs. 6-4\nand 6-5.\n\n9. In many rocket engines some of the pressurizing gas is used for purposes\nother than tank pressurization, such as actuation of valves or controls. The amount\nrequired has to be determined and added to the total needed gas mass.\nSimplified Analysis for the Mass of Pressurizing Gas\nThis is one example for a pressurizing system using a compressed gas initially\nin a separate tank at ambient temperature. It is the first category of pressurizing\nsystems discussed above and it is perhaps the most common type. It assumes an\nadiabatic expansion of the gas (implies no heat transfer to or from the system\nhardware), the gas behaves like an ideal gas (obeys the gas laws), and the con-\nservation of energy can be applied. Since the tank often has some insulation and\nsince the operation of the rocket engines is short, the expansion process will be\nclose to an adiabatic one. The expansion of the gas in the storage tank causes a\nsignificant drop in gas temperature and an increase in gas density. Furthermore\nit assumes that there is no evaporation of the liquid propellant (usually valid for\na propellant with low vapor pressure), the gas is inert, does not dissolve in the\nliquid propellant, and there is no sloshing or vortexing.\n\nLet the initial condition in the gas tank be given by subscript 0 and the\ninstantaneous conditions in the gas tank by subscript g and in the propellant tank\nby subscript p. The gas energy after and before propellant expulsion is\n\nMeCyTg + MpCyTp + Pp Vp = MoCyTo (6-5)\n\nThe work done by the gas in displacing the propellants is given by ppVp.\nUsing Eqs. 3-3 to 3-6, the initial storage gas mass mo may be found:\n\nCyPg Vo/R + CvPpVp/R + PpVp = mocvTo (6-6)\nmo = (Pg Vo + Pp Vpk)/(RTo)\n\nHere c, is the specific heat at constant volume, R is the gas constant per unit\nmass, and k is the specific heat ratio.

TURBOPUMP FEED SYSTEMS AND ENGINE CYCLES\nThe principal components of a rocket engine with one type of turbopump system\nare shown in the simplified diagram of Fig. 1-4. Here the propellants are pres-\nsurized by means of pumps, which in turn are driven by turbines. These turbines\nderive their power from the expansion of warm gases.\n\nFigures 10\u20141, 10\u20142, and 10\u20143 show examples of turbopumps and Chapter 10\nis devoted exclusively to the turbopump. It is a high precision accurately bal-\nanced piece of high shaft speed (rpm) rotating machinery. It has usually two or\none centrifugal pump and a turbine. Its high-speed high-load bearings support the\nshaft(s) on which the pump(s) and turbine are mounted. It has shaft seals to pre-\nvent leakage of propellants and also to prevent the two propellants from mixing\nwith each other inside the turbopump. Some turbopumps also have a gear trans-\nmission, which allows the pumps or turbine to rotate at a different, usually more\n",

Chapter 10 describes the design of turbopumps, the several\narrangements of the key components, the design of its major components, and\nalternate configurations. While pressurized feed systems can be started relatively\nquickly, the starting of turbopump feed systems usually takes longer, because it\ntakes some time for the rotating components (pumps, turbines) to accelerate to\noperating shaft speed. Starting is discussed in Section 11.4.\n\nEngines with turbopumps are preferred for booster and sustainer stages of\nspace launch vehicles, long-range missiles, and in the past also for aircraft\nperformance augmentation. They are usually lighter than other types for these\nhigh-thrust, long-duration applications. The inert hardware mass of the rocket\nengine (without tanks) is essentially independent of duration. Examples can be\nseen in Figs. 6\u20141 and 6-9 and also in Refs. 6-1, and 6\u20142. For aircraft perfor-\nmance augmentation the rocket pump was driven directly by the jet engine, as\nin Ref. 6-13. From the turbopump feed system options depicted in Chapter 10,\nthe designer can select the most suitable concept for a particular application.\n\nAs stated elsewhere in this book turbopump feed systems are usually preferred\nwhen the engine has a relatively high total impulse, which means high thrust and\nlong duration. Pressurized feed systems are best for rocket engines with relatively\nlow total impulse, that is, low thrust and often low cumulative firing durations.\nEngine Cycles\nEngine cycles apply only to liquid propellant rocket engines with a turbopump\nfeed system. The three most common engine cycles are shown in Fig. 6\u20149 and\nmany of each of these have flown. Reference 6\u201414 shows variations of these\nthree cycles and other feasible cycles; some of them have not yet flown and\nsome have not yet even been built.\n\nAn engine cycle for turbopump-fed engines describes the specific propellant\nflow paths through the major engine components, the method of providing the hot\ngas to one or more turbines, and the method of handling the turbine exhaust gases.\nThere are open cycles and closed cycles. Open denotes that the working fluid\nexhausting from the turbine is discharged overboard, usually after having been\nexpanded in a separate nozzle of its own as in Figs. 1-4 and 6-10, or discharged\ninto the nozzle exit section of the thrust chamber at a point in the expanding\nsection far downstream of the nozzle throat as shown in Fig. 6\u20149. In closed\ncycles or topping cycles all the working fluid from the turbine is injected into\nthe engine combustion chamber to make the most efficient use of its remaining\nenergy. In closed cycles the turbine exhaust gas is fed into the injector of the\nthrust chamber and is expanded through the full pressure ratio of the main thrust\nchamber nozzle, thus giving a little more performance than the open cycles,\nwhere these exhaust gases expand only through a relatively small pressure ratio.\n\nTable 6\u20146 shows key parameters for each of the three common cycles and\nit describes the differences between them. The schematic diagrams of Fig. 6-9\nshow each cycle with a separate turbopump for fuel and for oxidier. However,\nan arrangement with the fuel and oxdizer pump driven by the same turbine is\n",

Its propellants can be supplied from two separate propellant tanks or\ncan be bled off the main propellant feed system tanks. Some early engines used a\nseparate monopropellant for creating the generator gas. The German V-2 missile\nengine used hydrogen peroxide, which was decomposed by a catalyst. Typically,\nthe turbine exhaust gas is discharged overboard through one or two separate small\nlow-area-ratio nozzles (at relatively low specific impulse), as shown schematically\nin Fig. 1-4 and in the Vulcain engine or RS-68 engine listed in Table 11-2. See\nRef. 6-15. Alternatively, this turbine exhaust can be aspirated into the main flow\nthrough multiple openings in the diverging nozzle section, as shown schematically\nin Fig. 6\u20149 for a gas generator engine cycle. This gas then protects the walls near\nthe nozzle exit from high temperatures. Both methods can provide a small amount\nof additional thrust. The gas generator mixture ratio is usually fuel rich (in some\nengines it is oxidizer rich) so that the gas temperatures are low enough (typically\n900 to 1350 K) to allow the use of uncooled turbine blades and uncooled nozzle\nexit segments. The RS-68 rocket engine, shown in Fig. 6-10, has a simple\ngas generator cycle. As can be seen from the data under the figure, with a gas\ngenerator cycle the specific impulse of the thrust chamber by itself is always a\nlittle higher than that of the engine, and the thrust of the thrust chamber is always\nslightly lower than that of the engine. The thrust of the RS-68 can be reduced or\nthrottled to less then 60% of full thrust. See Ref. 6-15.\n\nThe expander cycle and the staged combustion cycle are both closed cycles,\nand they offer several percent higher performance than the gas generator cycle;\nthis small improvement makes a substantial difference in payload for flight mis-\nsions with high mission velocities. Alternatively they allow a somewhat smaller\nflight vehicle. However, the engines are usually more complex, heavier, and more\nexpensive.\n\nA flow diagram of an expander cycle is shown in Fig. 6-11. The engine\ncoolant (usually hydrogen fuel) is evaporated, heated, and then fed to low-\npressure-ratio turbines after having passed through the cooling jacket where it\npicked up energy. Part of the coolant, perhaps 5 to 15%, bypasses the turbine\n(shown in Fig. 6-11) and rejoins the turbine exhaust flow before the entire\ncoolant flow is injected into the engine combustion chamber where it mixes and\nburns with the oxidizer (see Refs. 6\u201414 and 6-16). The primary advantages of\nthe expander cycle are good specific impulse, relative engine simplicity, no gas\ngenerator, and relatively low engine mass. In the expander cycle all the propel-\nlants are fully burned in the engine combustion chamber and expanded efficiently\nin the exhaust nozzle of the thrust chamber.\n\nThis cycle is used in the RL10 hydrogen/oxygen rocket engine, and different\nversions of this engine have flown successfully in the upper stages of several\nspace launch vehicles. Data on the RL10 engines are given in Tables 6-8, 8-1,\nand 11-2. A modification of this engine, the RL10B-2 with an extendible nozzle\nskirt, can be seen in Fig. 8-17.

These auxiliary rocket engines are commonly\nused in spacecraft or missiles for the accurate control of flight trajectories, orbit\nadjustments, or attitude control of the vehicle. References 6\u20141 and 6-17 give\ninformation on several of these. Figure 6-13 shows a simplified flow diagram\nfor a postboost control rocket engine, with one larger rocket thrust chamber for\nchanging the velocity vector and eight small thrusters for attitude control.\n\nSection 4.5 describes various space trajectory correction maneuvers and satel-\nlite station-keeping maneuvers that are typically performed by these small aux-\niliary liquid propellant rocket engines with multiple thrusters. Table 6\u20147 lists\ntypical applications for rocket engines with small thrusters.\n\nAttitude control can be provided both while a primary propulsion system (of\na vehicle or of a stage) is operating and while its small thruster rocket system\noperates by itself.

The guidance system determines the maneuver to be undertaken and\nthe vehicle control system sends command signals to specific thrusters for the\nnumber of pulses needed to accomplish this maneuver. Small liquid propellant\nengine systems are uniquely capable of these pulsing operations. Some small\nthrusters have been tested for more than 300,000 pulses. For very short pulse\ndurations the specific impulse is degraded by 5 to 25%, because the performance\nduring the thrust buildup and thrust decay period (at lower chamber pressure) is\ninferior to operating only at the rated chamber pressure and the transient time\nbecomes a major portion of the total pulse time.\n\nBallistic missile defense vehicles usually have highly maneuverable upper\nstages. These require substantial side forces also called divert forces (200 to\n6000 N) during the final closing maneuvers just prior to reaching the target.\nIn concept the system is similar to that of Fig. 6\u201413, except that the larger\nthrust chamber would be at right angles to the vehicle axis. A similar system for\nterminal maneuvers, but using solid propellants, is shown in Figs. 12-27 and\n12-28.\n\nThe Space Shuttle performs its reaction control with 38 different thrusters,\nas shown schematically in Figs. 1-14 and 6-8; this includes several duplicate\n(spare or redundant) thrusters. Selected thrusters are used for different maneuvers,\nsuch as space orbit corrections, station keeping, or positioning the Space Shuttle\nfor reentry or visual observations. These small restartable rocket engines are also\nused for space rendezvous or docking maneuvers, where one spacecraft slowly\napproaches another and locks itself to the other, without causing excessive impact\nforces during this docking manuever. This docking operation requires rotational\nand translational maneuvers from a series of rocket engines.\n\nThe application of pure torque to spacecraft can be divided into two classes,\nmass expulsion types (rockets) and nonmass expulsion types. Nonmass expulsion\ntypes include momentum storage, gravity gradient, solar radiation, and magnetic\nsystems. Some space satellites are equipped with both the mass and nonmass\nexpulsion types. Reaction wheels or flywheels, a momentum storage device, are\nparticularly well suited to obtaining vehicle angular position control with high\naccuracies of less than 0.01\u00b0 deviation and low vehicle angular rates of less\nthan 10~> degrees/sec with relatively little expenditure of energy. The vehicle\nangular momentum is changed by accelerating (or decelerating) the wheel. Of\ncourse, when the wheel speed reaches the maximum (or minimum) permissible,\nno further electrical motor torquing is possible; the wheel must be decelerated (or\naccelerated) to have its momentum removed (or augmented), a function usually\naccomplished through the simultaneous use of two small attitude control rocket\nthrusters, which apply a torque to the vehicle in the opposite direction. This has\nbeen called desaturation of the fly wheel.\n",

    "249": "232 LIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINE FUNDAMENTALS\n\nThe propellants for auxiliary rockets fall into three categories: cold gas jets\n(also called inert gas jets), warm or heated gas jets, and chemical combustion\nrockets, such as bipropellant liquid propellant rockets. The specific impulse is\ntypically 50 to 120 sec for various cold gas systems and 105 to 250 sec for\nwarm gas systems. Warm gas systems can use inert gas with an electric heater\nor a monopropellant which is catalytically and/or thermally decomposed. Bipro-\npellant attitude control thrust chambers allow an I, of 220 to 325 sec and have\nvaried from 5 to 4000 N thrust; the highest thrusts apply to large spacecraft. All\nbasically use pressurized feed systems with multiple thrusters or thrust cham-\nbers equipped with fast-acting, positive-closing precision valves. Many systems\nuse small, uncooled, metal-constructed thrusters with supersonic exhaust nozzles,\nand they are strategically located on the periphery of the spacecraft pointing in\ndifferent directions. Gas jets are used typically for low thrust (up to 10 N) and\nlow total impulse (up to 4000 N-sec). They have been used on smaller satellites\nand often only for roll control. See Ref. 6\u201417 and Section 7.6.\n\nSmall liquid monopropellant and liquid bipropellant rocket units are common\nin auxiliary rocket systems for thrust levels typically above 2 N and total impulse\nvalues above 3000 N-sec. Hydrazine is the most common monopropellant used\nin auxiliary control rockets; nitrogen tetroxide and monomethylhydrazine is a\ncommon bipropellant combination. The next chapter contains data on all three\ncategories of these propellants, and Chapter 8 shows diagrams of small thrusters.\n\nCombination systems are also in use. Here a bipropellant with a relatively high\nvalue of J;, such as N2O4 and N2Hzg, is used in the larger thrusters, which consume\nmost of the propellant; then several simple monopropellant thrusters (with a\nlower /;), used for attitude control pulsing, usually consume a relatively small\nfraction of the total fuel. Another combination system is to employ bipropellant\nor monopropellant thrusters for adding a velocity increment to a flight vehicle\nor to bleed or pulse some of the pressurizing gas, such as helium, through small\nnozzles controlled by electromagnetic valves to provide roll control. The specific\nmission requirements need to be analyzed to determine which type or combination\nis most advantageous for a particular application.\n\nSpecial thruster designs exist that can be used in a bipropellant mode at higher\nthrust and also in a monopropellant mode for lower thrust. This can offer an\nadvantage in some spacecraft applications. An example is the Northrop-Grumman\nsecondary combustion augmented thruster (SCAT), which uses hydrazine and\nnitrogen tetroxide, is restartable, vaporizes the propellants prior to injection and\ntherefore has very efficient combustion (over 99%), can operate over a wide range\nof mixture ratios, and can be throttled from 5 to 15 lbf thrust.

    "250": "6.8. ENGINE FAMILIES 233\n6.8. ENGINE FAMILIES\nAn engine family is a series of related rocket engines, which have evolved over a\nperiod of many years. They come from the same rocket engine organization and\neach engine has been tailored to a specific application. The engines in the family\nhave a strong resemblance to each other, use the same engine concept, usually\nthe same propellants, and some identical or somewhat modified components of\nthe same type. When an existing proven liquid propellant rocket engine can be\nmodified and/or up-rated to fit a new application, the newer modified engine can\nuse a lot of the proven hardware, test data, and software of the original earlier\nengines.\n\nAn example is the RL 10 rocket engine family of upper-stage engines. It was\ndeveloped by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne over a period of about 46 years and\nis shown in Table 6-8. Data is from Refs. 6\u201412 and 6\u201416. Each engine is for\na specific application and is a modification and/or uprating of an earlier model.\nThe principal changes from one engine model to the next included increases in\nthrust, increases in performance (somewhat higher specific impulse) by using\nhigher chamber pressure, improved injector designs, and increases in nozzle exit\narea ratios. All use LOX/LH)2 propellants, the same basic engine concept with an\nexpander engine cycle, the same tubular cooling jacket approach for the chamber\nand nozzle throat region, the same generic geared turbopump arrangement, often\nthe same or similar valves, and power level control by a bypass of hydrogen gas\naround the turbine. In the turbopump the fuel pump and turbine are on the same\nhigh-speed shaft and the LOX pump is driven efficiently through a gear train at\na lower speed. All engines are gimbal mounted (most at 4\u00b0 maximum deflection)\nand most have space restart capability. Figure 8-17 shows the extendable nozzle\nof the RL 10B-2. In the RL 10A-3-3A thrust chamber a high-conductivity silver\nring was brazed with silver into the nozzle throat, thus enabling a higher chamber\npressure. The cooling jacket tubes were brazed with silver and were compatible.\nFigure 6\u201411 shows a flow sheet of an RL 10 expander engine cycle.\n\nIt is interesting to see how thrust or specific impulse changed with time and\nwith the model. Incidentally the specific impulse listed in Table 6-8 for the\nRL 10B-2 is the highest of any flying liquid propellant rocket engine in the world\nand the extendable nozzle exit segment of the RL 10A-4 was the first for liquid\npropellant rocket engines.\n\nWhen compared to a brand new engine, the principal benefits of adopting\na modified engine, which is based on an earlier family of proven engines, are\nsavings in costs (costs of design, development, less fabrication, less testing, quali-\nfication, and operation), attaining a high engine reliability more quickly, and often\nalso a shorter schedule. The heritage of earlier proven similar engines allows\nthe use of old engine or component data, having trained experienced personnel,\nproven subcontractors, a higher confidence level of reliability, and often, but not\n",

A brand\nnew engine may have slightly better performance and/or a somewhat lower inert\nengine mass and some other improvements, but it will usually be more costly,\ntake longer to develop, and take more time to reach an equivalent high level of\nreliability.\n\n6.9. VALVES AND PIPELINES\n\nValves control the flows of liquids and gases and pipes conduct these fluids to\nthe intended components. There are no rocket engines without them. There are\nmany different types of valves. All have to be reliable, lightweight, leakproof,\nand must withstand intensive vibrations and very loud noises. Table 6\u20149 gives\nseveral key classification categories for rocket engine valves. Any one engine\nwill use only some of the valves listed here.\n\nThe art of designing and making valves is based, to a large extent, on expe-\nrience. A single chapter cannot do justice to it by describing valve design and\noperation. References 6-1 and 6\u20142 decribe the design of specific valves, lines,\nand joints. Often the design details, such as clearance, seat materials, or opening\ntime delay present development difficulties. With many of these valves, any sig-\nnificant leakage or valve failure can cause a failure of the engine itself. All valves\nare tested for two qualities prior to installation; they are tested for leaks\u2014through\nthe seat and also through the glands\u2014and for functional soundness or perfor-\nmance.\n\nThe propellant valves in high-thrust units handle relatively large flows at high\nservice pressures. Therefore, the forces necessary to actuate the valves are large.\nHydraulic or pneumatic pressure, controlled by pilot valves, operates the larger\nvalves; these pilot valves are in turn actuated by a solenoid or a mechanical\nlinkage. Essentially this is a means of power boost.\n\nTwo valves commonly used in pressurized feed systems are isolation valves\n(when shut, they isolate or shut off a portion of the propulsion system) and latch\nvalves; they require power for brief periods during movements, such as to open\nor shut, but need no power when latched or fastened into either an open or a\nclosed position.\n\nA very simple and very light valve is a burst diaphragm. It is essentially a\ncircular disk of material that blocks a pipeline and is designed so that it will\nfail and burst at a predetermined pressure differential. Burst diaphragms are\npositive seals and prevent leakage, but they can be used only once. The German\nWasserfall anti-aircraft missile, an early application, used four burst disks; two\nwere in high-pressure air lines and two were in the propellant lines.\n",

Usually the discharge pressure is regulated to a predetermined\nstandard pressure value by continuously throttling the flow, using a piston, flexible\ndiaphragm, or electromagnet as the actuating mechanism. Regulators can be seen\nin the flow sheets of Figs. 1-3 and 6-13.\n\nThe various fluids in a rocket engine are usually transported by pipes or\nlines, usually made of metal and joined by fittings or welds. Their design must\nprovide for thermal expansion and provide support to minimize vibration effects.\nFor gimballed thrust chambers it is necessary to provide flexibility in the piping\nto allow the thrust axis to be rotated through a small angle, typically +3 to\n+10\u00b0. This flexibility is provided by flexible pipe joints and/or by allowing\npipes to deflect slightly when using two or more right-angle turns in the lines.\nThe high-pressure propellant feed lines of the SSME have both flexible joints\nand right-angle bends, as shown in Figs. 6\u20141 and 6-15. This joint has flexible\nbellows as a seal and a universal joint-type mechanical linkage with two sets of\nbearings for carrying the separating loads imposed by the high pressure.\n",

(Courtesy of Pratt &\nWhitney Rocketdyne.)\n\nSudden closing of valves can cause water hammer in the pipelines, leading\nto unexpected pressure rises that can be destructive to propellant system compo-\nnents. An analysis of this water hammer phenomenon will allow determination of\nthe approximate maximum pressure (Ref. 6-18). The friction of the pipe and the\nbranching of pipelines reduce this maximum pressure. Water hammer can also\noccur when admitting the initial flow of high-pressure propellant into evacuated\npipes. The pipes are under vacuum to remove air and prevent the forming of gas\nbubbles in the propellant flow, which can cause combustion problems.\n\nMany liquid rocket engines have filters in their lines. This is necessary to\nprevent dirt, particles, or debris, such as small pieces from burst diaphragms, from\nentering precision valves or regulators (where debris can cause a malfunction)\nor from plugging small injection holes, which could cause hot streaks in the\ncombustion gases, in turn causing a thrust chamber failure.\n\nOccasionally, a convergent\u2014divergent venturi section, with a sonic velocity\nat its throat, is placed into one or both of the liquid propellant lines.

In some large engines the thrust chamber is used as a structure\nand the turbopump, control boxes, or gimbal actuators are attached to it.\n\nIn addition to the thrust load, an engine structure has to withstand forces\nimposed by vehicle maneuvers (in some cases a side acceleration of 10 go),\nvibration forces, actuator forces for thrust vector control motions, and loads from\ntransportation over rough roads.\n\nIn low-thrust engines with multiple thrusters there often is no separate engine\nmounting structure; the major components are in different locations of the vehicle,\nconnected by tubing, wiring, or piping, and each is usually mounted directly to\nthe vehicle or spacecraft structure.\n",

    "262": "CHAPTER 7\nSS\nLIQUID PROPELLANTS\nSection 6.1 gave the classification of liquid propellants. In this chapter we\ndiscuss properties, performance, hazards, and characteristics of selected common\nliquid propellants. These characteristics affect the engine and vehicle design, test\nfacilities, and propellant storage and handling. Today we commonly use three\nliquid bipropellant combinations. Each of these propellants will be described\nfurther in this chapter. They are: (1) the cryogenic oxygen\u2014hydrogen propel-\nlant system, used in upper stages and sometimes booster stages of space launch\nvehicles; it gives the highest specific impulse for a nontoxic propellant combi-\nnation, which makes it best for high vehicle velocity missions; (2) the liquid\noxygen\u2014hydrocarbon propellant combination, used for booster stages (and a few\nsecond stages) of space launch vehicles; its higher average density allows a more\ncompact booster stage, when compared to the first combination; also, historically,\nit was developed before the first combination and was originally used for ballistic\nmissiles; (3) not a single propellant combination, but several storable propellant\ncombinations, are used in large rocket engines for first and second stages of\nballistic missiles and in almost all bipropellant low-thrust, auxiliary or reaction\ncontrol rocket engines (this term is defined below); they allow long-term storage\nand almost instant readiness to start without the delays and precautions that come\nwith cryogenic propellants. There also were fuel mixtures of several storable\npropellant such as alcohol and hydrazine. In Russia the nitric acid\u2014hydrocarbon\ncombination was used in ballistic missiles many years ago. Today Russia and\nChina favor nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer\u2014unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine,\nor UDMH, as the fuel for ballistic missiles and auxiliary engines. The United\nStates started with nitrogen tetroxide and a fuel mixture of 50% UDMH with 50%\nhydrazine in the large engines for the Titan II missile. For auxiliary engines in\nmany satellites and upper stages the United States has used, and is still using, the\n245\n",
    "263": "246 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\n\nbipropellant of nitrogen tetroxide with monomethylhydrazine. The orbit maneu-\nvering system of the Space Shuttle uses it. Alternatively many U.S. satellites\nhave used, and are still using monopropellant hydrazine for low-thrust auxiliary\nengines.\n\nIn the last 30 years there has not been a truly new propellant used in a\nrocket engine for an operational flight vehicle. Some new propellants, such as\nhydroxyl ammonium nitrate, have been synthesized, manufactured, and ground\ntested in thrust chambers in the last decade, but they have not found their way\ninto an operational rocket engine. Between 1942 and 1975 a number of other\npropellants (not the ones commonly used today) were successfully flown; this\nincludes ammonia (X-15 Research test aircraft), ethyl alcohol (German V-2 or\nU.S. Redstone), or aniline (WAC Corporal). They each had some disadvantages\nand they are no longer used for operational flights today. The liquid oxidizer\nnitrous oxide (N,O), also known as laughing gas, has found a new application\nin a hybrid propulsion system (with a solid fuel) and it is discussed further in\nChapter 16 on hybrid propulsion systems. Most of the commonly used liquid\noxidizers for liquid propellant rocket engines are listed and described briefly in\nthis chapter.\n\nA comparative listing of various performance quantities for a number of pro-\npellant combinations is given in Table 5\u20145 and in Ref. 7-1. Some important\nphysical properties of selected common propellants are given in Table 7-1. For\ncomparison water is also listed. Specific gravities and vapor pressures are shown\nin Figs. 7-1 and 7-2.\n\n7.1. PROPELLANT PROPERTIES\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the characteristics and properties of the\nliquid propellants (the fuel and oxidizer liquids in their unreacted condition) and\nthose of the hot gas mixture, which results from the reaction in the combustion\nchamber. The chemical nature of the liquid propellants and their mixture ratio\ndetermines the properties and characteristics of both of these types. Unfortunately,\nnone of the practical, known propellants have all the desirable properties, and\nthe selection of the propellant combination is usually a compromise of various\nfactors, such as those listed below.\n\nEconomic Factors\n\nAvailability in quantity and a low cost are very important considerations in the\nselection of a propellant. In military applications, consideration has to be given to\nlogistics of production, supply, storage, and other factors. The production process\nshould be simple, requiring only ordinary chemical equipment and available raw\nmaterials. It is usually more expensive to use a toxic or cryogenic propellant than\na storable, nontoxic one, because it requires additional steps in the operation, more\nsafety provisions, additional design features, longer check-out procedures prior\nto launch, and often better trained personnel.\n",

Here the average density, the total impulse,\nand the engine mass ratio usually enter into a complex flight relation equation.\nFor high performance a high content of chemical energy per unit of propel-\nlant mixture is desirable because it permits a high chamber temperature. A low\nmolecular mass of the product gases of the propellant combination is also desir-\nable. It can be accomplished by using fuels rich in combined hydrogen, which is\nliberated to become gas during the reaction. A low molecular mass is obtained if\na large portion of the hydrogen gas produced does not combine with oxygen. In\ngeneral, therefore, the best mixture ratio for many bipropellants is not necessar-\nily the stoichiometric one (which results in complete oxidation and yields a high\nflame temperature) but usually a fuel-rich mixture containing a large portion of\nlow-molecular-mass reaction products, as shown in Chapter 5.\n",

    "268": "7.1. PROPELLANT PROPERTIES 251\n\nIf very small metallic fuel particles of beryllium or aluminum are suspended\nin the liquid fuel, it is theoretically possible to increase the specific impulse\nby between 9 and 18%, depending on the particular propellant combination, its\nmixture ratio, and the metal powder additive. Gelled propellants with suspended\nsmall solid particles have been ground tested successfully with storable fuels.\nFor gelled propellants, see Section 7.5.\n\nThe chemical propellant combination that has the highest potential specific\nimpulse (approximately 480 sec at 1000 psia chamber pressure and expansion\nto sea-level atmosphere, and 565 sec in a vacuum with a nozzle area ratio of\n50) uses a toxic liquid fluorine oxidizer with hydrogen fuel plus suspended toxic\nsolid particles of beryllium; as yet a practical means for storing these propellants\nand a practical rocket engine have not been developed.\n\nCommon Physical Hazards\n\nAlthough the several categories of hazards are described below, they do not all\napply to every propellant or every bipropellant combination. The hazards are\ndifferent for each specific propellant and must be carefully understood before\nworking with that propellant. The consequences of unsafe operation or unsafe\ndesign are usually also unique to several propellants.\n\nCorrosion. Various propellants, such as nitrogen tetroxide, nitric acid, or hydro-\ngen peroxide, have to be handled in containers and pipelines of special materials.\nIf the propellant were permitted to become contaminated with corrosion prod-\nucts, its physical and chemical properties could change sufficiently to make it\nunsuitable for rocket operation. The corrosion of the gaseous reaction products\nis important in applications in which the reaction products are likely to damage\nstructure and parts of the vehicle or affect communities and housing near a test\nfacility or launch site.\n\nExplosion Hazard. Some propellants, such as hydrogen peroxide and\nnitromethane, are unstable and tend to detonate under certain conditions of impu-\nrities, temperature, and shock. If liquid oxidizers (e.g., liquid oxygen) and fuels\nare mixed together, they can be detonated. Unusual, rare flight vehicle launch or\ntransport accidents have caused such mixing to occur (see Refs. 7\u20142 and 7-3).\nFire Hazard. Many oxidizers will start chemical reactions with a large variety of\norganic compounds. Nitric acid, nitrogen tetroxide, fluorine, or hydrogen peroxide\nreact spontaneously with many organic substances, resulting in a conflagration.\nMost of the fuels are readily ignitable when exposed to air and heat. Also some\nhousehold dusts, certain paints, or smoke particles can be oxidized.\nAccidental Spills.

The U.S. Department of Transportation has\ntules for marking and containing hazardous materials during transport and also\nguidelines for emergency action (see Ref. 7\u20144).\n\nHealth Hazards. Many propellants are toxic or poisonous, and special pre-\ncautions have to be taken to protect personnel. Fluorine, for example, is very\npoisonous. Toxic propellant chemicals or poisonous exhaust species can enter\nthe human body in several ways. The resulting health disorders are propellant\nspecific. Nitric acid can cause severe skin burns and tissue disintegration. Skin\ncontact with aniline or hydrazine can cause nausea and other adverse health\neffects. Hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine, unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, or\nhydrazine hydrate are known animal carcinogens (cancer-causing substances)\nand suspected human carcinogens. Many propellant vapors cause eye irritation,\neven in very small concentration. Inadvertent ingestion (swallowing) of many\npropellants can also cause severe health degradation.\n\nThe inhalation of certain toxic exhaust gases or gaseous or vaporized propel-\nlants is perhaps the most common health hazard. It can cause severe damage\nif the exposure is for long duration or in concentrations that exceed established\nmaximum threshold values. In the United States the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA) has established limits or thresholds on the allow-\nable exposure and concentration for most propellant chemicals. Several of these\nthreshold limits are mentioned later in this chapter. Toxic gases in the exhaust\ncould include hydrofluoric acid (HF) gas; its OSHA 8-hr personnel exposure\nlimit is 3 ppm (volumetric parts per million) and its short-term (typically, 15\nmin) exposure limit is 6 ppm. A concentration of 3000 ppm or 0.3% can be fatal\nwithin a few seconds. References 7-2 and 7\u20145 give more information on toxic\neffects.\n\nThe corrosion, explosion, and fire hazards of many propellants put severe\nlimitations on the materials, the handling, and the design of rocket-propelled\nvehicles and their vehicle\u2019s engine compartments. Not only is the rocket system\nitself exposed to the hazardous propellant, but adjacent personnel, structural parts,\nelectrical and other vehicle equipment, and test and launch facilities have to\nbe properly protected against the effects of possible leaks, fumes, and fires or\nexplosions from propellant accumulations.\n\nMaterial Compatibility. Several liquid propellants have only a limited num-\nber of truly compatible materials, both metals and nonmetals, such as gaskets or\nO-rings. There have been unfortunate failures (causing fires, leakage, corrosion,\nor malfunctions) when an improper or incompatible material was used in the\nhardware of a rocket engine. Depending on the specific component and load-\ning conditions, these structural materials have to withstand high stresses, stress\ncorrosion, and in some versions high temperatures or abrasion. Several specific\nmaterial limitations are mentioned in the next section. Certain materials catalyze\na self-decomposition of stored hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, mak-\ning long-term storage difficult and, if confined, causing its closed container to\n",

Many structural materials, when exposed to cold, cryogenic propellants,\ncan become very brittle.\n\nDesirable Physical Properties\n\nLow Freezing Point. This permits operation of rockets in cold weather. The\naddition of small amounts of freezing point depressant has been found to help\nlower the freezing point of some liquid propellants which otherwise might solidify\nat relatively high temperature.\n\nHigh Specific Gravity. A denser propellant will provide a larger mass of pro-\npellants in a given vehicle tank volume. It permits a smaller tank volume and,\nconsequently, a lower structural vehicle mass and lower aerodynamic drag. Pro-\npellant specific gravity, therefore, has an important effect on the maximum flight\nvelocity and range of any rocket-powered vehicle or missile, particularly when\nflying within the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as explained in Chapter 4. Specific gravities\nfor various propellants are plotted in Fig. 7-1. A variation of the temperature of\nstored propellant will cause a change of the liquid level in the tank.\n\nFor any given mixture ratio r, the average specific gravity of a propellant\ncombination 5,, can be determined from the specific gravities of the fuel 5- and of\nthe oxidizer 5,. The average specific gravity is defined as the mass of the fuel and\noxidizer, divided by the sum of their volumes. Here the mixture ratio is defined\nas the oxidizer mass flow rate divided by the fuel mass flow rate.

The\nvalue of 5,y can be increased by adding heavy materials to the propellants, either\nby solution or colloidal suspension. The identical type of equation can be written\nfor the average density pay in terms of the fuel density and the oxidizer density:\n\nPopp +r)\npy = (7-2)\nPfr + Po\n\nIn the SI system of units the specific gravity has the same numerical value\nas the density expressed in units of grams per cubic centimeter or kg/liter.

No deterioration and no decomposition with long-term (over 15 years)\nstorage and minimal reaction with the atmosphere have been attained with many\npropellants. Good chemical stability means no decomposition of the liquid pro-\npellant during operation or storage, even at elevated temperature. A good liquid\n",
    "271": "254 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\npropellant should also have no chemical deterioration when in contact with tub-\ning pipes, tank walls, valve seats, and gasket materials, even at relatively high\nambient temperatures. No appreciable absorption of moisture and no adverse\neffects of small amounts of impurities are desirable properties. There should be\nno chemical deterioration when liquid flows through the hot cooling jacket pas-\nsages of a regeneratively cooled thrust chamber. Some hydrocarbons (e.g., some\nolefins) decompose and form carbonaceous deposits on the hot inside surfaces\nof the cooling passage. These deposits can become hard, reduce the heat flow,\nincrease the local metal temperatures, and thus can cause the metal to weaken and\nfail. About 1% per year of stored 90% concentrated hydrogen peroxide decom-\nposes even in clean storage tanks. Between | and 20% of a cryogenic propellant\n(stored in a flight vehicle) evaporates every day in an insulated tank.\nHeat Transfer Properties. High specific heat, high thermal conductivity, and\na high boiling or decomposition temperature are desirable for propellants that are\nused for thrust chamber cooling (see Section 8.5).\nPumping Properties. A low vapor pressure permits not only easier handling\nof the propellants, but also a more effective pump design in applications where\nthe propellant is pumped. This reduces the potential for cavitation, as explained in\nChapter 10. If the viscosity of the propellant is too high, then pumping and engine-\nsystem calibration become difficult. Propellants with high vapor pressure, such as\nliquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, and other liquefied gases, require special design\nprovisions, unusual handling techniques, and special low-temperature materials.\nTemperature Variation of Physical Properties. The temperature variation\nof the physical properties of the liquid propellant should be small and should\nbe very similar for the fuel and for the oxidizer. For example, a wide tempera-\nture variation in vapor pressure and density (thermal coefficient of expansion) or\nan unduly high change in viscosity with temperature makes it difficult to accu-\nrately calibrate a rocket engine flow system or predict its performance over any\nreasonable range of operating temperatures.\nIgnition, Combustion, and Flame Properties\nIf the propellant combination is spontaneously ignitable, it does not require an\nignition system. This means that burning is initiated as soon as the oxidizer and\nthe fuel come in contact with each other. Spontaneously or self-ignitable propel-\nlant combinations are often termed hypergolic propellants. Although an ignition\nsystem is not a very objectionable feature, its elimination is usually desirable\nbecause it simplifies the propulsion system. All rocket propellants should be read-\nily ignitable and have only a very short ignition time delay in order to reduce\nthe potential explosion hazard during starting. Starting and ignition problems are\ndiscussed further in Section 8.6.\n\nNonspontaneously ignitable propellants have to be heated by external means\nbefore ignition can begin. Igniters are devices that accomplish an initial slight\n",
    "272": "7.1. PROPELLANT PROPERTIES 255\npressurization of the chamber and the initial heating of the propellant mixture\nto the point where steady flow combustion can be self-sustained. The amount\nof energy added by the igniter to activate the propellants should be small so\nthat low-power ignition systems can be used. The energy required for satis-\nfactory ignition usually diminishes for increasing ambient temperature of the\npropellant. At low ambient temperatures ignition can be very slow (0.05 to\n0.02 sec).\n\nCertain propellant combinations burn very smoothly without combustion vibra-\ntion which are gas pressure oscillations. Other propellant combinations do not\ndemonstrate this combustion stability and, therefore, are less desirable. Combus-\ntion is treated in Chapter 9.\n\nSmoke formation is objectionable in many applications because of the smoke\ndeposits on the surrounding equipment and parts. Smoke and brilliantly luminous\nexhaust flames are objectionable in certain military applications because they\ncan be easily detected. In some applications the condensed species in the exhaust\ngas can cause surface contamination on spacecraft windows or optical lenses,\nand the electrons in the flame can cause undesirable interference or attenuation\nof communications radio signals. See Chapter 20 for information on exhaust\nplumes.\n\nProperty Variations and Specifications\n\nThe propellant properties and quality must not vary from batch to batch, because\nthis can affect engine performance, combustion, and physical or chemical prop-\nerties. The same propellant must have the same composition, properties, and\nstorage or rocket operating characteristics if manufactured at different times or\nif made by different manufacturers. For these reasons propellants are purchased\nagainst specifications which define ingredients, maximum allowable impurities,\npackaging methods or compatible materials, allowable tolerances on physical\nproperties (such as density, boiling point, freezing point, viscosity, or vapor\npressure), quality control requirements, cleaning procedures for containers, doc-\numentation of inspections, laboratory analyses, or test results. A careful chemical\nanalysis of the composition and impurities is necessary. Reference 7\u20146 describes\nsome of these methods of analysis.\n\nAdditives\n\nAltering and tailoring propellant properties can be achieved with additives. For\nexample, to make a nonhypergolic fuel become hypergolic (readily ignited), a\nreactive ingredient has been added. To desensitize concentrated hydrogen perox-\nide and reduce self-decomposition, it is diluted with 3 to 15% of clean water.\nTo increase density or to alleviate certain combustion instabilities, a fine pow-\nder of a heavy solid material, such as aluminum, can be suspended in the fuel.\nThe use of additives to lower the freezing point temperature has already been\nmentioned.\n",
    "273": "256 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\n\n7.2. LIQUID OXIDIZERS\n\nThe most energetic oxidizer with the highest specific impulse is liquid fluorine.\nIt has a high density and is extremely corrosive and toxic. It has been tested in\nseveral complete rocket engines but has been abandoned because of its hazards.\nMany different types of new storable and cryogenic liquid oxidizer propellants\nhave been synthesized, tested in small thrust chambers, or proposed. For high spe-\ncific impulse this includes boron\u2014oxygen\u2014fluorine compounds, oxygen\u2014fluorine\ncompounds, nitrogen\u2014fluorine formulations, and fluorinated hydrocarbons; how-\never, they all have some undesirable characteristics and these synthetic oxidizers\nhave not been proven to be practical. Oxidizer liquids that have been used in\nexperimental liquid rocket engines include mixtures of liquid oxygen and liq-\nuid fluorine, oxygen difluoride (OF,), chlorine trifluoride (CIF3), or chlorine\npentafluoride (CIF;). All of these are highly toxic, very corrosive, and are not\nused today. Several commonly used oxidizers are listed below.\n\nLiquid Oxygen (O2)\n\nLiquid oxygen, often abbreviated as LOX, boils at 90 K at atmospheric pressure;\nat these conditions it has a specific gravity of 1.14 and a heat of vaporization\nof 213 kJ/kg. It is widely used as an oxidizer and burns with a bright white-\nyellow flame with most hydrocarbon fuels. It has been used in combination\nwith alcohols, jet fuels (kerosene-type), gasoline, and hydrogen. As shown in\nTable 5\u20145, the attainable performance is relatively high, and liquid oxygen is\ntherefore a desirable and commonly used propellant in large rocket engines. The\nfollowing missiles and space launch vehicles use oxygen: (1) with jet fuel or RP-\n1 (kerosene)\u2014Atlas V and Soyuz (Russia); (2) with hydrogen\u2014Space Shuttle,\nAriane-V (France), Delta IV, and Centaur upper stage; (3) with alcohol\u2014some\namateur rocket engines, Figs. 1-4 and 6\u20141 show units that use oxygen. Figures\n5-1 to 5\u20146 give theoretical performance data for liquid oxygen with a kerosene-\ntype fuel.\n\nAlthough it usually does not burn spontaneously with organic materials at\nambient pressures, combustion or explosions can occur when a confined mix-\nture of oxygen and organic matter is suddenly pressurized. Impact tests show\nthat mixtures of liquid oxygen with many commercial oils or organic materials\nwill detonate. Liquid oxygen supports and accelerates the combustion of other\nmaterials. Handling and storage are safe when contact materials are clean. Liquid\noxygen is a noncorrosive and nontoxic liquid and will not cause the deteriora-\ntion of clean container walls. When in prolonged contact with human skin, the\ncryogenic propellant causes severe frostbite. Because liquid oxygen evaporates\nrapidly, it cannot be stored readily for any great length of time. If liquid oxygen\nis used in large quantities, it is often produced very close to its geographical\npoint of application. Liquid oxygen can be obtained in several ways, such as by\nfractionated distillation of liquid nitrogen out of liquid air.\n\nIt is necessary to insulate all lines, tanks, valves, and so on that contain liquid\noxygen in order to reduce the evaporation loss. Rocket propulsion systems which\n",
    "274": "7.2. LIQUID OXIDIZERS 257\nremain filled with liquid oxygen for several hours and liquid oxygen storage\nsystems have to be well insulated against absorbing heat from the surroundings.\nExternal drainage provisions have to be made on all liquid oxygen tanks and\nlines to eliminate the water that condenses on the walls.\n\nExample 7-1. Estimate the approximate temperature and volume change of liquid oxy-\ngen if an oxygen tank is pressurized to 8.0 atm for a long time before engine start. Assume\nthe tank is 60% full and the evaporated oxygen is caught, refrigerated, and recondensed\n(constant mass).\nSOLUTION. Using Table 7\u20141 and Figs. 7-1 and 7-2, the vapor pressure goes from 1.0\natm (0.1 MPa) to 8 atm (about 0.8 MPa) and the equilibrium temperature goes from the\nboiling point of 90 K at 1.0 atm to about 133 K at 8 atm. The corresponding specific\ngravities are 1.14 and 0.88, respectively. This is an increase of 1.14/0.88 = 1.29. (29%\nmore volume). The tank would be 77% full.\n\nIn tanks with turbopump feed systems the actual tank pressures are lower (typically 2 to\n4 atm) and the evaporated oxygen is vented, causing a cooling effect on the liquid surface.\nSo the numbers calculated above are too large (8 atm was selected to clearly show the\neffect). The warming occurs when there is a long hold period of a pressurized cryogenic\npropellant tank and is most pronounced when the final portion of the propellant is being\nemptied. Nevertheless the higher temperature, higher vapor pressure, and lower density\ncan cause changes in mixture ratio, required tank volume, and pump suction condition\n(see Section 10.5). Therefore tanks with cryogenic propellant are insulated (to minimize\nheat transfer and density changes) and are pressurized only shortly before engine start, so\nas to keep the propellant at its lowest possible temperature and highest density.\nHydrogen Peroxide (H202)\nThis propellant is not only a powerful liquid oxidizer but also a clean-burning\nmonopropellant. In rocket applications, hydrogen peroxide has been used in a\nhighly concentrated form of 70 to 99%; the remainder is mostly water. Com-\nmercial peroxide is approximately 30% concentrated. For many paper and pulp\nmills it is 70% concentrated hydrogen peroxide. It was used in gas generators\nand rocket applications between 1938 and 1965 (X-1 and X-15 research aircraft).\nToday 90% hydrogen peroxide is the most common.\n\nAs a monopropellant it decomposes according to the following chemical reac-\ntion, forming superheated steam and gaseous oxygen:\n\nH202 > HjO + 50> + heat\n\nThis decomposition is brought about by the action of catalysts such as silver\nscreens, various liquid permanganates, solid manganese dioxide, platinum, and\niron oxide. In fact, most impurities act as a catalyst. H2O2 is hypergolic with\nhydrazine and will burn well with kerosene. The theoretical specific impulse of\n90% hydrogen peroxide is 154 sec, when used as a monopropellant with a solid\ncatalyst bed.\n",
    "275": "258 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\n\nEven under favorable conditions H,O, will often decompose at a slow rate\nduring storage, about 1% per year for 90 to 95%, and gas will bubble out of the\nliquid. Contaminated liquid peroxide must be disposed of before it reaches about\n448 K, when an explosion may occur. Concentrated peroxide causes severe burns\nwhen in contact with human skin and may ignite and cause fires when in contact\nwith wood, oils, and many other organic materials. In the past rocket engines\nwith hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer have been used for aircraft boost (German\nMe 163, and U.S. F 104) and a satellite launcher (Britain: Black Arrow). As a\nmonopropellant it was used for attitude control thrusters and for gas generators.\nIt has not been used for a long time, partly because of its long-term storage\nstability. However, there has been some improvement and some renewed interest\nin this dense oxidizer, which produces a nontoxic exhaust.\n\nNitric Acid (HNO3)\n\nThere are several types of nitric acid mixtures that have been used as oxidiz-\ners between 1940 and 1965; they are not used extensively today in the United\nStates. The most common type, red fuming nitric acid (RFNA), consists of con-\ncentrated nitric acid (HNO3) that contains between 5 and 27% dissolved nitrogen\ndioxide (NO). The evaporating red-brown fumes are exceedingly annoying and\npoisonous. Compared to concentrated nitric acid (also called white fuming nitric\nacid), RFNA is more energetic, more stable in storage, and slightly less corrosive\nto many tank materials.\n\nNitric acid is highly corrosive. Only certain types of stainless steel, gold, and\na few other materials are satisfactory as storage containers or tubing materi-\nals. A small addition of fluoride ion (less than 1% of hydrofluoric acid, or HF)\ninhibits the nitric acid, causes a protective fluoride layer to form on the wall, and\nreduces the corrosion with many metals. It is called inhibited red fuming nitric\nacid (IRFNA). Even with an inhibitor, nitric acid reacts with the wall materials\nand forms dissolved nitrates and sometime insoluble nitrates. This changes the\nproperties of the acid and may cause blocking of valve and injector orifices. In\ncase of accidental spilling, the acid should be diluted with water or chemically\ndeactivated. Lime and alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates are common neu-\ntralizing agents. However, nitrates formed by the neutralization are also oxidizing\nagents and must be handled accordingly.\n\nNitric acid has been used with gasoline, various amines, hydrazine, dimethyl-\nhydrazine, and alcohols. It ignites spontaneously with hydrazine, furfuryl alcohol,\naniline, and other amines. The specific gravity of nitric acid varies from 1.5 to\n1.6, depending on the percentages of nitrogen dioxide, water, and impurities.\nThis high density permits compact vehicle construction.\n\nVapors from nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid have an OSHA 8-hr personnel\nexposure limit or a threshold work allowance of 2 ppm (parts per million or about\n5 mg/m?) and a short-term exposure limit of 4 ppm. Droplets on the skin cause\nburns and sores which do not heal readily.\n",
    "276": "7.3, LIQUID FUELS 259\nNitrogen Tetroxide (N20,), Often Abbreviated as NTO\nThis is a high-density yellow-brown liquid (specific gravity of 1.44). It is com-\nmonly used with the hypergolic fuels hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine (MMH),\nand unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). Although it is the most com-\nmon storable oxidizer today, its liquid temperature range is narrow and it is easily\nfrozen or vaporized. It is only mildly corrosive when pure, but forms strong acids\nwhen moist or allowed to mix with water. It readily absorbs moisture from the\nair. It can be stored indefinitely in sealed containers made of compatible material.\nIt is hypergolic with many fuels and can cause spontaneous ignition with many\ncommon materials, such as paper, grease, leather, or wood. The NO2 fumes are\nreddish brown and are extremely toxic. Because of its high vapor pressure it must\nbe kept in relatively heavy tanks. The freezing point of N.O, can be lowered (for\nexample, by adding a small amount of nitric oxide or NO) but at the penalty of\na higher vapor pressure and slightly reduced performance. This mixture of NO\nand N20, is called mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON) and different grades have\nbetween 2 and 30% by weight NO content.\n\nNitrogen tetroxide oxidizer is used with UDMH in many Russian engines and\nalmost all their small thrusters. It is also used with monomethylhydrazine fuel in\nthe Space Shuttle orbital maneuver system, multithruster reaction control system,\nand in many U.S. spacecraft propulsion systems. In many of these applications\ncare must be taken to avoid freezing this nitrogen tetroxide. The OSHA 8-hr\npersonnel exposure limit is 5 ppm or 9 mg/m?.\n\n7.3. LIQUID FUELS\n\nAgain, many different chemicals have been proposed, investigated, and tested\nas fuels. Only a few have been used in production rocket engines. Liquid fuels\nother than those listed in this chapter have been used in experimental rocket\nengines, in older experimental designs, and in some older production engines.\nThese include aniline, furfuryl alcohol, xylidine, gasoline, hydrazine hydrate,\nborohydrides,-methyl and/or ethyl alcohol, ammonia, and mixtures of some of\nthese.\n\nHydrocarbon Fuels\n\nPetroleum derivatives encompass a large variety of different hydrocarbon chem-\nicals, most of which can be used as a rocket fuel.

A specifically\nrefined petroleum product particularly suitable as a rocket propellant has been\ndesignated RP-1 (Rocket Propellant number 1). It is basically a kerosene-type\nfuel mixture of hydrocarbons with a somewhat narrow range of densities and\nvapor pressure. Several hydrocarbon fuels can form carbon deposits on the inside\nof cooling passages, impeding the heat transfer and raising wall temperatures.\nRef. 7\u20147 indicates that this carbon formation depends on fuel temperature in\nthe cooling jacket, the particular fuel, the heat transfer, and the chamber wall\nmaterial. RP-1 is low in olefins and aromatics, which can cause carbonaceous\ndeposits inside fuel cooling passages. RP-1 has been used with liquid oxygen\nin many early rocket engines (see Figs. 5-1 to 5\u20146 and Ref. 7-8). A very\nsimilar kerosene-type fuel is used in Russia today. A few years ago RP-2 was\nsubstituted for RP-1 in U.S. rocket applications. The principal difference is a\nreduced sulphur content (see Table 7\u20142), because this impurity was believed to\nhave caused corrosion in cooling jackets of certain thrust chambers. See Ref.\n7-8.\n\nMethane (CH,) is a cryogenic hydrocarbon fuel. It is denser than liquid hydro-\ngen and relatively low in cost.

Experimental\noxygen\u2014methane engines have been tested, but they have not yet flown.\n\nLiquid Hydrogen (H2)\n\nLiquid hydrogen, when burned with liquid fluorine or liquid oxygen, gives a high\nperformance, as shown in Table 5\u20145. It also is an excellent regenerative coolant.\nWith oxygen it burns with a colorless flame; however, the shock waves in the\nplume may be visible. Of all known fuels, liquid hydrogen is the lightest and\nthe coldest, having a specific gravity of 0.07 and a boiling point of about 20 K.\nThe very low fuel density requires bulky fuel tanks, which necessitate very large\nvehicle volumes. The extremely low temperature limits the selection of materials\nfor pumps, cooling jackets, tanks, and piping because many metals become brittle\nat low temperatures.\n\nBecause of its low temperature, liquid hydrogen tanks and lines have to be\nwell insulated to minimize the evaporation of hydrogen or the condensation of\nmoisture or air on the outside with the subsequent formation of liquid or solid air\nor ice. A vacuum jacket often has been used in addition to insulating materials.\nAll common liquids and gases solidify in liquid hydrogen. These solid particles in\nturn plug orifices and valves. Therefore, care must be taken to purge all lines and\ntanks of air and moisture (flush with helium or pull vacuum) before introducing\nthe propellant. Mixtures of liquid hydrogen and solid oxygen or solid air can be\nexplosive.\n\nLiquid hydrogen has two isomers, namely, orthohydrogen and parahydrogen,\nwhich differ in the orientation of their nuclear spin state. As hydrogen is liquefied\nand cooled to lower and lower temperatures, the relative equilibrium composition\nof ortho- and parahydrogen changes. The transformation from orthohydrogen to\nparahydrogen is exothermic and results in excessive boiloff, unless complete\nconversion to parahydrogen is achieved during liquefaction. Liquid hydrogen is\nmanufactured from gaseous hydrogen by successive compression, cooling, and\nexpansion processes.\n\nHydrogen gas, when mixed with air, is highly flammable and explosive over\na wide range of mixture ratios. To avoid this danger, escaping excess hydrogen\ngas (at tank vent lines) is often intentionally ignited and burned or \u201cflared\u201d in\nair. Liquid hydrogen is used with liquid oxygen in the Delta IV launcher, Cen-\ntaur upper stage, the Space Shuttle main engine, and upper stage space engines\ndeveloped in Japan, Russia, Europe, India, and China.\n\nHydrogen burning with oxygen forms a nontoxic almost invisible exhaust\ngas. This propellant combination has been applied successfully to space launch\nvehicles because of its high specific impulse. Here the payload capability usually\nincreases greatly for relatively small increases in specific impulse. However, the\nlow density of hydrogen makes for a very large fuel tank, a large vehicle, and a\nrelatively high drag.\n\nSome studies have shown that, when burned with liquid oxygen, a hydrocarbon\n(such as methane or RP-1) can give a small advantage in space launch vehicle first\n",
    "279": "262 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\n\nstages. Here the higher average propellant density allows a smaller vehicle with\nlower drag, which compensates for the lower specific impulse of the hydrocarbon\nwhen compared to a hydrogen fuel. Also, there are some concepts for operating\nthe booster-stage rocket engine initially with hydrocarbon fuel and then switching\nduring flight to hydrogen fuel. Engines using LOX and these two fuels, namely\nhydrocarbon and hydrogen, have been called tripropellant engines. They have\nnot yet been fully developed or flown. Some work on experimental engines was\ndone in Russia, but there is no known current effort.\n\nHydrazine (N2Ha4)\n\nReference 7\u20149 gives a good discussion of this propellant, which is used as a\nbipropellant fuel as well as a monopropellant. Hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine\n(MMH), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) have similar physical\nand thermochemical properties. Hydrazine is a toxic, colorless liquid with a high\nfreezing point (274.3 K or 34\u00b0F). Hydrazine tanks, pipes, injectors, catalysts, and\nvalves are usually electrically heated to prevent freezing in cool weather or in\nouter space. Hydrazine has a short ignition delay and is spontaneously ignitable\nwith nitric acid, nitrogen tetroxide, and concentrated hydrogen peroxide.\n\nIts vapors may form explosive mixtures with air. If hydrazine is spilled on a\nporous surface or a cloth, a spontaneous ignition with air can occur.\n\nPure anhydrous hydrazine is a stable liquid; it has been safely heated above 480\nK. It has been stored in sealed tanks for over 15 years. With impurities or at higher\ntemperatures it decomposes and releases energy. Under pressure shock (blast\nwave or adiabatic compression) hydrazine vapor or hydrazine mist can decom-\npose at temperatures as low as 367 K. Under some conditions this decomposition\ncan be a violent detonation, and this has caused problems in cooling passages\nof experimental injectors and thrust chambers. Harmful effects to personnel may\nresult from ingestion, inhalation of vapors, or prolonged contact with skin. The\nAmerican Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recom-\nmended 8-hr personnel exposure limit is 0.01 ppm or 0.013 mg/m?. Hydrazine\nis a known animal carcinogen and a suspected carcinogen for people.\n\nHydrazine reacts with many materials, and care must be exercised to avoid\nstorage contact with materials that cause a decomposition (see Refs. 7-9 and\n7-10). Tanks, pipes, injectors, catalysts, or valves must be cleaned and free of\nimpurities. Compatible materials include certain stainless steels (303, 304, 321,\nor 347), nickel, and 1100 and 3003 series of aluminum. Iron, copper, and its\nalloys (such as brass or bronze), monel, magnesium, zinc, and some types of\naluminum alloy must be avoided.\n\nUnsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine [(CH3)2NNH2]\n\nA derivative of hydrazine, namely UDMH, is often used instead of or in mix-\ntures with hydrazine because it forms a more stable liquid, particularly at higher\ntemperatures. Furthermore, it has a lower freezing point (215.9 K) and a lower\n",

UDMH is often used\nwhen mixed with 30 to 50% hydrazine or with 25% hydrazine hydrate. UDMH\nis used in Russian and Chinese rocket engines and small thrusters. The ACGIH\nrecommended 8-hr personnel exposure limit for vapor is 0.01 ppm, and UDMH\nis a suspected carcinogen.\n\nMonomethylhydrazine (CH3NHNH2)\n\nThis fuel abbreviated as MMH has been used extensively in U.S. spacecraft\nrocket engines, particularly in small attitude control engines, usually with N2O4\nas the oxidizer. It has a better shock resistance to blast waves and a better\nliquid temperature range than pure hydrazine. Like hydrazine, its vapors are eas-\nily ignited in air; the flammability limits are from 2.5 to 98% by volume at\natmospheric sea-level pressure and ambient temperature. The materials compat-\nible with hydrazine are also compatible with MMH. The specific impulse with\nstorable oxidizers usually is 1 or 2% lower with MMH than with NoHy.\n\nBoth MMH and UDMH are soluble in many hydrocarbons; hydrazine is not.\nAll hydrazines are toxic materials, but MMH is the most toxic when inhaled.\nAtmospheric concentrations of all hydrazines should be kept below 0.1 ppm for\nlong periods of personnel exposure.\n\nMonomethylhydrazine, when added in relatively small quantities of 3 to 15%\nto hydrazine, has a substantial quenching effect on the explosive decomposition of\nhydrazine. Monomethylhydrazine decomposes at 491 K, whereas hydrazine can\nexplode at 369 K when subjected to certain pressure shocks. MMH is a known\nanimal carcinogen and the ACGIH recommended personnel 8-hour exposure limit\nis 0.01 ppm.\n\n7.4. LIQUID MONOPROPELLANTS\n\nThe propellant-feed and control-system simplicity associated with a monopropel-\nlant makes this type of propellant attractive for certain applications. Hydrazine\nis being used extensively as a monopropellant in small attitude and trajectory\ncontrol rockets for the control of satellites and other spacecraft and also as a\nhot gas generator. (It is discussed in the preceding section.) Other monopro-\npellants (ethylene oxide or nitromethane) were tried experimentally, but are no\nlonger used today. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide was used for small thrusters\nbetween 1945 and 1965 and for monopropellant gas generation in the United\nStates, Russia, United Kingdom or Britain, and Germany.\n\nIgnition of monopropellants can be achieved thermally (electrical or flame\nheat) or by a catalytic material. A monopropellant must be chemically and ther-\nmally stable to ensure good liquid storage properties, and yet it must be easily\ndecomposed and reactive to quickly give good combustion.\n",
    "281": "264 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\nHydrazine as a Monopropellant\nHydrazine is not only an excellent storable fuel but also an excellent monopro-\npellant when decomposed by a suitable solid catalyst; this catalyst often needs\nto be preheated for fast startup or for extending the useful catalyst life. Iridium\non porous alumina base is an effective catalyst at room temperature. At ele-\nvated temperature (about 450 K) many materials decompose hydrazine, including\niron, nickel, and cobalt. See Ref. 7\u20149. Different catalysts and different catalyst\nconfigurations make the decomposition reaction go to different products, result-\ning in gases varying in composition or temperature.

Typical operating parameters are\nshown in Fig. 7-3.\n\nThe catalytic decomposition of hydrazine can be described ideally as a two-\nstep process; this ignores other steps and intermediate products. First, hydrazine\n(N2H4) decomposes into gaseous ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen (N2); this reac-\ntion is highly exothermic, that is, it releases heat. Second, the ammonia decom-\nposes further into nitrogen and hydrogen gases, but this reaction is endothermic\nand absorbs heat. These simplified reactions can be written as\n\n3N2H4 > 4(1 \u2014 x)NH3 + (1 + 2x)N2 + 6xH2 (7-4)\nHere x is the degree of ammonia dissociation; it is a function of the catalyst type,\nsize, and geometry, the chamber pressure, and the dwell time within the catalyst\nbed. Figure 7\u20143 shows several ideal rocket engine parameters for hydrazine\nmonopropellant as a function of x, the fraction of ammonia that is decomposed.\nThe values are for an ideal thruster at 1000 psia chamber pressure with a nozzle\narea ratio of 50 expanding at high altitude. The best specific impulse is attained\nwhen little ammonia is allowed to dissociate.\n7.5. GELLED PROPELLANTS\nGelled propellants have additives that make them thixotropic materials. They\nhave the consistency of thick paint or jelly when at rest, but they liquefy and\nflow through pipes, valves, pumps, or injectors when an adequate shear stress is\napplied. They offer these advantages: (1) Small aluminum fuel particles can be\nsuspended in the fuels. Inert solid particles can be suspended in oxidizer liquids.\nThis increases propellant density, density impulse, and thus reduces the size of\ntanks and vehicles. (2) There is no plugging of injector orifices or valve passages\nand good flow control has been demonstrated. (3) Most gelled fuel propellants are\nessentially nonflammable and will not usually sustain an open fire. (4) There is\nreduced susceptibility of leakage or spill, reduced sloshing of liquids in the tanks,\nand the boil-off rate is reduced. (5) Long-term storage of 10 years or more without\nsettling or separation of the solid particles has been demonstrated. (6) Explosions\nor detonations, which happen when a vehicle accident causes liquid propellants to\nbecome inadvertently mixed, are much less likely with gelled propellants, which\nare difficult to mix. (7) Short-duration pulsing has been tested. (8) Most storable\noxidizers, a few cryogenic propellants, and most liquid storable fuels can be\ngelled. (9) Explosions are much less likely when a propellant tank is penetrated\nby a bullet or when a missile is exposed to an external fire or a nearby detonation.\n\nThese are some of the disadvantages: (1) There is a small decrease in specific\nimpulse due to dilution with a gelling agent, and less efficient atomization into\nsmall droplets (due to high viscosity) or less efficient combustion. For example,\nthe characteristic velocity c* of oxygen\u2014kerosene propellant is decreased by\n",
    "283": "266 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\n\n4 to 6% when the kerosene is gelled and aluminum is suspended in the fuel.\n(2) Bubble-free loading or unloading of propellants is somewhat more complex\nand may take longer. Residual propellant quantity will be slightly higher because\nthe thixotropic fluid layer on the walls of the tanks and pipes will be thicker.\n(3) Changes in ambient temperature will cause slight changes in propellant density\nand viscosity and therefore also in mixture ratio; this can result in more leftover\nor residual propellant and thus in a slight reduction of available total impulse.\nSuspended metals can make the exhaust plume smoky and visible.\n\nExperimental rocket engines have shown these gelled propellants to be gen-\nerally safer than ordinary liquid propellants and to have adequate performance\nand operational characteristics (see Refs. 7-11 and 7-12). This makes them less\nsusceptible to field accidents. A variety of different organic and inorganic gelling\nagents have been explored with a number of different liquid propellants.\n\nExperimental thrust chambers and rocket engine systems have been satisfacto-\nrily demonstrated with several gelled propellant combinations. One experimental\nengine has flown. As far as is known, no such rocket engine has yet been put\ninto production or flight operation.\n\n7.6. GASEOUS PROPELLANTS\n\nCold gas propellants have been used successfully for reaction control systems\n(RCS) for more than 60 years. The words \u201ccold gas\u201d (stored at ambient temper-\nature) is distinguished from a \u201cwarm gas,\u201d which has been heated. The engine\nsystem is simple, consisting of one or more high-pressure gas tanks, multiple\nsimple nozzles (often aluminum or plastic), an electrical control valve with each\nnozzle, a pressure regulator, and provisions for filling and venting the gas. The\ntank size will be smaller if the tank pressures are high. Pressures are typically\nbetween 300 and 1000 MPa (about 300 to 10,000 psi), and these gas tanks have\nthick wells and are heavy.\n\nTypical cold gas propellants and some of their properties and characteristics\nare listed in Table 7-3. Nitrogen, argon, dry air, krypton and Freon 14 have\nbeen employed in spacecraft RCS. With high-pressure hydrogen or helium as\ncold gas, the specific impulse is much higher, but the densities of these gases are\nmuch lower. This requires a much larger gas storage volume and heavier high-\npressure tanks. In most applications the extra inert mass outweighs the advantage\nof better performance. In a few applications the gas (and its storage tank) are\nheated electrically or chemically. This improves the specific impulse and allows\na smaller tank, but it also introduces complexity.\n\nThe selection of the gas propellant, the storage tanks, and RCS design depend\non many factors, such as volume and mass of the storage tanks, the maximum\nthrust and total impulse, the gas density, required maneuvers, duty cycle, and\nflight duration. Cold gas systems have been used for total impulses of perhaps\n22,200 N-sec or 5000 Ibf-sec. Higher values usually employ liquid propellants.\n\nIf the operation is short (most of the gas consumed in a few minutes, while\nthe main engine is running), the gas expansion will be close to adiabatic (no heat\n",

For long\nintermittent operations (months or years in space) the heat from the spacecraft\nis transfered to the gas and the tank temperature stays essentially constant; the\nexpansion will be nearly isothermal.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of cold gas thrusters and systems are\ndescribed in Section 8.3 in the discussion of low thrust.\n7.7. SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS\nTo minimize the hazards and potential damage inherent in reactive propellant\nmaterials, it is necessary to be very conscientious about the likely risks and\nhazards (see Refs. 7-4, 7-13, and 7-14). This concerns toxicity, explosiveness,\nfire or spill danger, and others mentioned in Section 7.1. Before an operator,\nassembler, maintenance mechanic, supervisor, or engineer is allowed to transfer\nor use a particular propellant, he or she should receive safety training in the\nparticular propellant, its characteristics, its safe handling or transfer, potential\ndamage to equipment or the environment, and the countermeasures for limiting\nthe consequences in case of an accident. They must also understand the potential\nhazards to the health of personnel, first aid, remedies in case of contact exposure\nof the skin, ingestion, or inhaling, and the use of safety equipment. Examples of\nsafety equipment are protective clothing, face shields, detectors for toxic vapors,\nremote controls, warning signals, or emergency water deluge. The personnel\nworking with or being close to highly toxic materials usually have to undergo\nperiodic health monitoring. Also rocket engines need to be designed for safety\nto minimize the occurrence of a leak, an accidental spill, an unexpected fire, or\nother potentially unsafe conditions. Most organizations have one or more safety\nspecialists who review the safety of the test plans, manufacturing operations,\ndesigns, procedures, or safety equipment. With the proper training, equipment,\nprecautions, and design safety features, all propellants can be handled safely.\n",
    "285": "268 LIQUID PROPELLANTS\nIf a safety violation occurs or if an operation, design, procedure, or practice\n\nis found to be (or appears to be) unsafe, then a thorough investigation of the\n\nparticular item or issue should be undertaken, the cause of the lack of safety\nshould be investigated and identified, and an appropriate remedial action should\nbe selected and initiated as soon as possible.\n\nThe discharge of toxic exhaust gases to the environment and their dispersion\nby the wind can cause exposure of operating personnel as well as the people in\nnearby areas, and can cause damage to plants and animals. This is discussed in\nSection 20.2. The dumping or spilling of toxic liquids can contaminate subter-\nranean aquifers and surface waters, and their vapors can pollute the air. Today\nthe type and amount of gaseous and liquid discharges are regulated and moni-\ntored by government authorities. These discharge quantities must be controlled\nor penalties will be assessed against violators. Obtaining a permit to discharge\ncan be a lengthy and involved procedure.\n\nPROBLEMS\n\n1. Plot the variation of the density specific impulse (product of average specific gravity\nand specific impulse) with mixture ratio and explain the meaning of the curve.

The RP-1 hydrocarbon fuel has a nominal temperature of 298 K and it can\nvary at about 25\u00b0C. The liquid oxygen is nominally at its boiling point (90 K),\nbut, after the tank is pressurized, this temperature can increase by up to 30 K during\nlong time storage. What are the extreme mixture ratios under unfavorable temperature\nconditions? If this engine has a nominal mass flow rate of 100 kg/sec and a duration\nof 100 sec, what is the maximum residual propellant mass when the other propellant\nis fully consumed? Use the curve slopes of Fig. 7\u20141 to estimate changes in density.\nAssume that the specific impulse is constant for the relatively small changes in mixture\nratio, that small vapor pressure changes have no influence on the pump flow, that there\nis no evaporation of the oxygen in the tank, and that the engine has no automatic\ncontrol for mixture ratio. Assume zero residual propellant.\n\n5. The vehicle stage propelled by the rocket engine in Problem 4 has a design mass ratio\nmy /mo of 0.50 (see Eq. 4\u20146).

The thrust chamber is the key subassembly of a rocket engine.\nHere the liquid propellants are metered, injected, atomized, vaporized, mixed,\nand burned to form hot reaction gas products, which in turn are accelerated and\nejected at supersonic velocity (see Refs. 6\u20141, 6\u20142, and 8-1). A rocket thrust\nchamber assembly (Figs. 8\u20141 and 8\u20142) has an injector, a combustion chamber ,\na supersonic nozzle, and mounting provisions. All have to withstand the extreme\nheat of combustion and the various forces, including the transmission of the\nthrust force to the vehicle. There also is an ignition system if nonspontaneously\nignitable propellants are used. Some thrust chamber assemblies also have inte-\ngrally mounted propellant valves and sometimes a thrust vector control device,\nas described in Chapter 18. Table 8\u20141 gives various data about five different\nthrust chambers with different kinds of propellants, cooling methods, injectors,\nfeed systems, thrust levels, or nozzle expansions. Some engine parameters are\nalso listed. Some of the terms used in this table will be explained later in this\nchapter.\n\nThe basic analyses for thrust chamber specific impulse and combustion temper-\nature are given in Chapter 5, the basic design parameters (thrust, flow, chamber\npressure, or throat area) are in Chapter 3, and the combustion phenomena in\nChapter 9.\n\nAlthough we use the word thrust chamber in this book (for rocket engines\ngenerally larger than 1000 Ibf thrust), some technical publications use the terms\nthrust cylinder, thrust cell, or rocket combustor. We will also use the term thruster\nfor small thrust units, such as attitude control thrusters, and for electrical propul-\nsion systems.\n\n271\n",

    "293": "276 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\n8.1. INJECTORS\n\nThe functions of an injector are similar to those of a carburetor of an internal\ncombustion engine. The injector has to introduce and meter the flow of liquid\npropellants to the combustion chamber, cause the liquids to be broken up into\nsmall droplets (a process called atomization), and distribute and mix the propel-\nlants in such a manner that a correctly proportioned mixture of fuel and oxidizer\nwill result, with uniform propellant mass flow and composition over the chamber\ncross section.\n\nThere are two design approaches for admitting propellants into the combustion\nchamber. The individual locations on the injector face are called injector elements.\nThe older types use a set of propellant jets going through a set of holes in a pattern\non the injector face. Different hole arrangements are shown in Figure 8\u20143. Many\nof the rocket injectors developed in the United States used this type for large\nand small thrust chambers. The second type has cylindrical injection elements,\nwhich are inserted and fastened (welded, brazed, or soldered) into the injector\nface and each element delivers a conically shaped spray of propellants into the\ncombustion chamber. Figure 8\u20144 shows several spray injection elements with\nconical sheets of propellant coming from a slot or from the internal edge of a\nhollow cylinder in the injection element. It has been used with LOX/LH)p thrust\nchamber worldwide including the Space Shuttle thrust chamber. Also it has been\nthe preferred approach in Russia (and its predecessor the Soviet Union), where\nit was used with most propellants and all thrust chamber sizes. There are also\nsome combination types that use jets and sprays together. Typical injectors with\nhole patterns can be seen in Figs. 8\u20141 and 8-5.\n\nThe injection pattern on the face of the injector is closely related to the\ninternal manifolds or feed passages within the injector. These provide for the\ndistribution of the propellant from the injector inlet to all the injection holes or\nspray elements. A large complex manifold volume allows low passage velocities\nand good distribution of flow over the cross section of the chamber. A small\nmanifold volume allows for a lighter weight injector, a faster start, and reduces\nthe amount of \u201cdribble\u201d flow after the main valves are shut. The higher passage\nvelocities usually cause a more uneven flow through different identical injection\nholes and thus a poorer distribution and wider local gas composition variation.\nDribbling results in after-burning, which is an inefficient irregular combustion\nthat gives a little \u201ccutoff\u201d thrust after valve closing. For applications with very\naccurate terminal vehicle velocity requirements, the cutoff impulse has to be very\nsmall and reproducible and often valves are built into the injector to minimize\npassage volume.\n\nDoublet impinging-stream-type, multiple-hole injectors are commonly used\nwith oxygen\u2014hydrocarbon and storable propellants, as seen in Fig. 8-3. For\nunlike doublet patterns the propellants are injected through a number of separate\nsmall holes in such a manner that the fuel and oxidizer streams impinge upon\neach other. Impingement forms thin liquid fans and aids atomization of the liquids\ninto droplets, also aiding distribution. Characteristics of specific injector orifices\n",

The splash plate-type was popular in the late 1940s and 1950s\nbut is not used today. (Used with permission from Ref. 8-1.)\nare given in Table 8\u20142. Impinging hole injectors are also used for like-on-like or\nself-impinging patterns (fuel-on-fuel and oxidizer-on-oxidizer). The two liquid\nstreams then form a fan which breaks up into droplets. Unlike doublets work\nbest when the hole size (more exactly, the volume flow) of the fuel is about\nequal to that of the oxidizer and the ignition delay is long enough to allow the\nformation of fans. For uneven volume flow the triplet pattern often seems to be\nmore effective.\n\nThe nonimpinging or shower head injector employs nonimpinging streams\nof propellant usually emerging normal to the face of the injector. It relies on\nturbulence and diffusion to achieve mixing. The German World War II V-2\nrocket used this type of injector. This type is no longer used because it requires\na large chamber volume for good combustion.\n",

Simplified cross-section sketches of several common types of spray injec-\ntion elements. (Used with permission from Ref. 8-1.)\n\nSheet or spray-type injectors give cylindrical, conical, or other types of spray\nsheets; these sprays generally intersect and thereby promote mixing and atom-\nization. See Fig. 8\u20144. The conical sheets break up into droplets, which are then\nvaporized. The size distribution of droplets from spray injection elements is usu-\nally more uniform than with impinging streams from holes. By changing some\nof the internal dimensions of the spray elements (change size or number of tan-\ngential feed holes, the length/protrusion of an internal cylinder, or the angle of\nan internal spiral rib), it is possible to change the angle of the conical sheet or\nthe location of the impingement of fuel and oxidizer spray sheets, and to affect\nthe combustion efficiency. By varying the width of the sheet (through an axi-\nally movable sleeve), it is possible to throttle the propellant flow over a wide\nrange without excessive reduction in injector pressure drop. This type of variable\narea concentric tube injector was used on the descent engine of the Apollo lunar\nexcursion module and throttled over a 10:1 range of flow with only a very small\nchange in mixture ratio or performance.\n",

Large holes are inlets to fuel mani-\nfolds. Predrilled rings are brazed alternately over an annular fuel manifold or groove and\na similar adjacent oxidizer manifold or groove. A section through a similar but larger\ninjector is shown in Fig. 8-1.\n\nThe coaxial hollow post or spray injector has been used for liquid oxygen\nand gaseous hydrogen injectors by most domestic and foreign rocket designers.\nIt is shown in sketches d and e of Fig. 8\u20144. It works well when the liquid\nhydrogen has absorbed heat from cooling jackets and has been gasified. This\ngasified hydrogen flows at high speed (typically 330 m/sec or 1000 ft/sec); the\nliquid oxygen flows far more slowly (usually at less than 33 m/sec or 100 ft/sec),\nand the differential velocity causes a shear action, which helps to break up the\noxygen stream into small droplets. The injector has a multiplicity of these coaxial\nelements on its face. In Russia and in Germany the spray injector elements have\nalso been used with storable propellants.\n\nThe SSME injector shown in Fig. 9-6 uses 600 of these concentric sleeve\ninjection elements; 75 of them have been lengthened beyond the injector face to\nform cooled baffles, which reduce the incidence of combustion instability.\n\nThe original method of making injection holes was to carefully drill them and\nround out or chamfer their inlets. This is still being done today. It is difficult\nto align these holes accurately (for good impingement) and to avoid burrs and\nsurface irregularities. One method that avoids these problems and allows a large\nnumber of small accurate injecton orifices is to use multiple etched, very thin\nplates (often called platelets) that are then stacked and diffusion bonded together\n",

These relationships are general and can be applied to any one\nsection of the propellant feed system, to the injector, or to the overall liquid flow\nsystem.\n\nFor any given pressure drops the injection orifices usually determine the mix-\nture ratio and the propellant flows of the rocket unit. From Eqs. 6-1 and 8-2\nthe mixture ratio r is\n\nr = mo /mp = ((Ca)o/ (Cap Ao/Ap) V (Po / Pp) (APo/ Apr) (8-3)\nThe quantities in the preceding equations have to be chosen so that the correct\ndesign mixture ratio is attained. Orifices whose discharge coefficients are constant\nover a large range of Reynolds numbers and whose ratio (Cq)o/(Ca)\u00a2 remains\nessentially invariant should be selected. For a given injector it is usually difficult\nto maintain the mixture ratio constant at low flows or thrusts, such as in starting.\n\nThe quality of the injector can be checked by performing cold tests with\ninert simulant liquids instead of reactive propellant liquids. Often water is used\nto confirm pressure drops through the fuel or oxidizer side at different flows,\nand this allows determination of the pressure drops with propellants and the\ndischarge coefficients. Nonmixable inert liquids are used with a special apparatus\nto determine the local cold flow mixture ratio distribution over the chamber cross\nsection. The simulant liquid should be of approximately the same density and\nviscosity as the actual propellant. New injectors are usually hot fired and tested\nwith actual propellants.\n\nThe actual mixture ratio can be estimated from cold flow test data, the mea-\nsured hole areas, and discharge coefficients by correcting by the square root of the\ndensity ratio of the simulant liquid and the propellant. When water at the same\npressure is fed alternately into both the fuel and the oxidizer sides, App = Apo\nand py = , and the water mixture ratio will be\n\nr = [(Ca)o/(Cadp Ao/Ag (8-4)\nTherefore, the mixture ratio measured in water tests can be converted into the\nactual propellant mixture ratio by multiplying it by the square root of the density\nratio of the propellant combination and the square root of the pressure drop ratio.\nThe mechanism of propellant atomization with simultaneous vaporization, partial\ncombustion, and mixing is difficult to analyze, and performance of injectors has to\nbe evaluated by experiment within a burning rocket thrust chamber.

Smooth and well-rounded entrances to the\ninjection holes and clean bores give high values of the discharge coefficient, and\nthis hole entry design is the most common. Small differences in chamfers, hole\nentry radius, or burrs at the edge of a hole can cause significant variations in\nthe discharge coefficient and the jet flow patterns, and these in turn can alter the\nquality and distribution of the atomized small droplets, the local mixture ratio,\nand the local heat transfer rates. An improperly manufactured hole can cause\nlocal chamber or injector burnout.\n\nWhen an oxidizer and a fuel jet impinge, the resultant momentum can be\ncalculated from the following relation, based on the principle of conservation of\nmomentum. Figure 8\u20147 illustrates a pair of impinging jets and defines yo as the\nangle between the chamber axis and the oxidizer stream, yy as the angle between\nthe chamber axis and the fuel stream, and 6 as the angle between the chamber\naxis and the average resultant stream.

Some of the analyses (see Ref. 8\u20142) has been useful in understanding\nthe phenomenology and in indicating the directions for injector development. The\navailable data indicate several important factors that affect the performance and\noperating characteristics of injectors; some of these are briefly enumerated here.\nThese factors are different for injectors where both propellants are liquid (such\nas nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine) or where one propellant is liquid and the\nother is gaseous as with LOX/gasified liquid hydrogen. Monopropellant injectors\nfeed propellants into a catalyst bed and they are different and described in\nSection 8.3.\n\nPropellant Combination. The particular combination of fuel and oxidizer\naffects such characteristics as the relative chemical reactivity, the ease and speed\nof vaporization, the ignition temperature, the diffusion of hot gases, the volatil-\nity, or the surface tension. Hypergolic (self-igniting) propellants generally require\ninjector designs somewhat different from those required by propellants that must\nbe ignited. Injector designs that perform efficiently with one combination do not\nnecessarily work too well with a different propellant combination.\n\nInjection, Element Pattern, and Orifice Size. With individual elements of\nholes or sprays in the injector plate, there appears to be an optimum performance\nand/or heat transfer condition for each of the following parameters: orifice size,\nangle of impingement, angle of resultant momentum, distance of the impingement\nlocus from the injector face, number of injection orifices per unit of injector face\nsurface, flow per unit of injection orifice, and distribution of orifices over the\ninjector face. These parameters are largely determined experimentally or from\nsimilar earlier successful injectors.\n\nTransient Conditions. Starting and stopping may require special provisions\n(temporary plugging of holes, accurate valve timing, insertion of paper cups over\nholes to prevent entry of one propellant into the manifold of the other propellant\nas was done on the German A-4 or V-2 thrust chamber, or check valves) to\npermit satisfactory transient operation.\n\nHydraulic Characteristics. The orifice type and the pressure drop across the\ninjection orifice determine the injection velocity. A low pressure drop is desirable\nto minimize the weight of the feed system or the pumping power. High-pressure\ndrops are used often to increase the rocket\u2019s resistance to combustion instability\nand enhance atomization of the liquids and improve performance.\n",
    "302": "8.2. COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND NOZZLE 285\nHeat Transfer. Injectors influence the performance and the heat transferred\nin rocket thrust chambers. Low heat transfer rates have been obtained when\nthe injection pattern resulted in an intentionally rich mixture near the chamber\nwalls and when the chamber pressure is low. In general, the higher performance\ninjectors have a higher heat transfer rate to the walls of the combustion chamber,\nthe nozzle, and the injector face.\nStructural Design. The injector is highly loaded by pressure forces from the\ncombustion chamber and the propellant manifolds. During transition (starting or\nstopping) these pressure conditions can cause internal transient structural stresses\nwhich sometimes exceed the steady-state operating conditions. The faces of most\nmodern injectors are flat and must be reinforced by suitable structures which\nnevertheless should provide no obstructions to the hydraulic manifold passages;\nthe structure must also be sufficiently flexible to allow thermal deformations\ncaused by heating the injector face with hot combustion gases or cooling of\ncertain flow passages by cryogenic propellants. The injector design must also\nprovide for positive seals between fuel and oxidizer manifolds (an internal leak\ncan cause manifold explosions or internal fires) and a sealed attachment of the\ninjector to the chamber. In large, gimbal-mounted thrust chambers the injector\nalso often carries the main thrust load, and a gimbal mount is often directly\nattached to the injector, as shown in Figs. 6\u20141 and 8-1.\nCombustion Stability. The injection hole or spray pattern, impingement pat-\ntern, hole or spray element distribution, and pressure drop have a strong influence\non combustion stability; some types are much more resistant to pressure distur-\nbances. As explained in Section 9.3, the resistance to vibration is determined\nexperimentally, and often special antivibration devices, such as baffles or reso-\nnance cavities, are designed directly into the injector.\n8.2. COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND NOZZLE\nThe combustion chamber is that part of a thrust chamber where the combustion\nor burning of the propellant takes place. The combustion temperature is much\nhigher than the melting points of most chamber wall materials. Therefore it is\nnecessary either to cool these walls (as described in a later section of this chapter)\nor to stop rocket operation before the critical wall areas become too hot. If the\nheat transfer is too high and thus the wall temperatures become locally too high,\nthe thrust chamber will fail. Heat transfer to thrust chambers will be described\nlater in this chapter. Section 8.8 gives a sample analysis of a thrust chamber and\nRef. 8\u20142 describes the analyses for design and development.\nVolume and Shape\nSpherical chambers give the least internal surface area and inert mass per unit\nchamber volume; they are expensive to build and several have been tried. Today\n",
    "303": "286 THRUST CHAMBERS.\nwe prefer a cylindrical chamber (or slightly tapered cone frustum) with a flat\ninjector and a converging\u2014diverging nozzle. The chamber volume is defined as\nthe volume up to the nozzle throat section, and it includes the cylindrical chamber\nand the converging cone frustum of the nozzle. Neglecting the effect of the corner\nradii, the chamber volume V, is\n\nVe = ALi + AiLe (1 + VAr/Ai + Ar /Al) (8-8)\nHere L; is the cylinder length, A;/A; is the chamber contraction ratio, and L, is\nthe length of the conical frustum. The chamber surfaces exposed to heat transfer\nfrom hot gas are the injector face, the inner surface of the cylinder chamber, and\nthe inner surface of the converging cone frustrum. The volume and shape are\nselected after evaluating these parameters:\n\n1. The volume has to be large enough for adequate atomization, mixing, evapo-\nration, and complete combustion of propellants. Chamber volumes vary for\ndifferent propellants with the time delay necessary to vaporize and activate\nthe propellants and with the speed of combustion reaction of the propel-\nlant combination. When the chamber volume is too small, combustion is\nincomplete and the performance is poor. With higher chamber pressures\nor with highly reactive propellants, and with injectors that give improved\nmixing, a smaller chamber volume is usually permissible.\n\n2. The chamber diameter and volume can influence the cooling requirements.\nIf the chamber volume and the chamber diameter are large, the heat transfer\nrates to the walls will be reduced, the area exposed to heat will be large, and\nthe walls are somewhat thicker. Conversely, if the volume and cross section\nare small, the inner wall surface area and the inert mass will be smaller, but\nthe chamber gas velocities and the heat transfer rates will be increased. For\nthe same thrust chamber there is an optimum chamber volume and diameter\nwhere the total heat absorbed by the walls will be a minimum. This is\nimportant when the available cooling capacity of the coolant is limited (e.g.,\noxygen\u2014hydrocarbon at high mixture ratios) or if the maximum permissive\ncoolant temperature has to be limited (for safety reasons with hydrazine\ncooling). The total heat transfer can also be further reduced by going to a\nrich mixture ratio or by adding film cooling (discussed below).\n\n3. All inert components should have minimum mass. The thrust chamber mass\nis a function of the chamber dimensions, chamber pressure, and nozzle area\nratio, and the method of cooling.\n\n4. Manufacturing considerations favor a simple chamber geometry, such as\na cylinder with a double cone bow-tie-shaped nozzle, low-cost materials,\nand simple fabrication processes.\n\n5. In some applications the /ength of the chamber and the nozzle relate directly\nto the overall length of the vehicle. A large-diameter but short chamber\nand/or a short nozzle can allow a somewhat shorter vehicle with a lower\nstructural inert vehicle mass.\n",
    "304": "8.2. COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND NOZZLE 287\n\n6. The gas pressure drop for accelerating the combustion products within the\nchamber should be a minimum; any pressure reduction at the nozzle inlet\nreduces the exhaust velocity and the performance of the vehicle. These\nlosses become appreciable when the chamber area is less than three times\nthe throat area.\n\n7. For the same thrust the combustion volume and the nozzle throat area\nbecome smaller as the operating chamber pressure is increased. This means\nthat the chamber length and the nozzle length (for the same area ratio) also\ndecrease with increasing chamber pressure. The performance and the heat\ntransfer also go up with chamber pressure.\n\nThe preceding chamber considerations conflict with each other. It is, for\ninstance, impossible to have a large chamber that gives complete combustion\nbut has a low mass. Depending on the application, a compromise solution that\nwill satisfy the majority of these considerations is therefore usually selected and\nverified by experiment.\n\nThe characteristic chamber length is defined as the length that a chamber of\nthe same volume would have if it were a straight tube and had no converging\nnozzle section:\n\nLt =Ve/Ar (8-9)\nwhere L* (pronounced el star) is the characteristic chamber length, A, is the\nnozzle throat area, and V, is the chamber volume. The chamber includes all the\nvolume up to the throat area. Typical values for L* are between 0.8 and 3.0 m (2.6\nto 10 ft) for several bipropellants and higher for some monopropellants. Because\nthis parameter does not consider any variables except the throat area, it is useful\nonly for a particular propellant combination and a narrow range of mixture ratio\nand chamber pressure. The parameter L* was used about 40 years ago, but today\nthe chamber volume and shape are chosen by using data from successful thrust\nchambers of prior similar designs and identical propellants.\n\nThe stay time t, of the propellant gases is the average value of the time spent\nby each molecule or atom within the chamber volume. It is defined by\n\nts = Ve/(mVi) (8-10)\nwhere mm is the propellant mass flow, V, is the average specific volume or volume\nper unit mass of propellant gases in the chamber, and V, is the chamber vol-\nume. The minimum stay time at which a good performance is attained defines the\nchamber volume that gives essentially complete combustion. The stay time varies\nfor different propellants and has to be experimentally determined. It includes the\ntime necessary for vaporization, activation, and complete burning of the propel-\nlant. Stay times have values of 0.001 to 0.040 sec for different types and sizes\nof thrust chambers and for different propellants.\n",
    "305": "288 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nThe nozzle dimensions and configuration can be determined from the analyses\npresented in Chapter 3. The converging section of the nozzle experiences a much\nhigher internal gas pressure than the diverging section and therefore the design\nof the converging wall is similar to the design of the cylindrical chamber wall.\nThe exact contour of the converging nozzle section is not critical. Most thrust\nchambers use a shortened bell shape for the diverging nozzle section. Nozzles\nwith area ratios over 400 have been developed and flown.\n\nIn Chapter 3 it was stated that very large nozzle exit area ratios allow a\nsmall but significant improvement in specific impulse, particularly at very high\naltitudes; however, the extra length, extra nozzle mass, and extra vehicle mass\nnecessary to house a large nozzle often make this unattractive. This disadvantage\ncan be mitigated by a multipiece nozzle that is stored in annular pieces around\nthe engine during the ascent of the launch vehicle and automatically assem-\nbled in space after launch vehicle separation and before firing. This concept,\nknown as extendible nozzle, has been successfully employed in solid propellant\nrocket motors for space applications for about 27 years. The first flight with an\nextendible nozzle on a liquid propellant engine was performed in 1998 with a\nmodified version of a Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne upper stage engine. Its flight\nperformance is listed in Table 8\u20141. The engine is shown later in Fig. 8\u201417 and\nits carbon\u2014carbon extendible nozzle cone is described in the section on materials\nand fabrication of this chapter.\n\nHeat Transfer Distribution\n\nHeat is transmitted to all internal hardware surfaces exposed to hot gases, namely\nthe injector face, the internal chamber and nozzle walls. The heat transfer rate\nor heat transfer intensity, that is, local wall temperatures and heat transfer per\nunit wall area, varies within the thrust chamber. A typical heat transfer rate\ndistribution is shown in Fig. 8-8. Only 0.5 to 5% of the total energy generated\nin the gas is transferred as heat to the chamber walls. For a typical rocket of\n44,820 N or 10,000 lbf thrust the heat rejection rate to the wall may be between\n0.75 and 3.5 MW, depending on the exact conditions and design. See Section 8.5.\n\nThe amount of heat transferred by conduction from the chamber gas to the\nwalls in a rocket thrust chamber is negligible. By far the largest part of the heat is\ntransferred by means of convection. A part (usually 5 to 35%) of the transferred\nheat is attributable to radiation.\n\nFor constant chamber pressure, the chamber wall surface increases less rapidly\nthan the volume as the thrust level is raised. Thus the cooling of chambers is\ngenerally easier in large thrust sizes, and the capacity of the wall material or the\ncoolant to absorb all the heat rejected by the hot gas is generally more critical\nin smaller sizes because of the volume-\u2014surface relationship.\n\nHigher chamber pressure leads to higher vehicle performance (higher /,), but\nalso to higher engine inert mass. However, the resulting increase of heat transfer\nwith chamber pressure often imposes design or material limits on the maximum\npractical chamber pressure for both liquid and solid propellant rockets.\n",

Typical axial heat transfer rate distribution for liquid propellant thrust\nchambers and solid propellant rocket motors. The peak is always at the nozzle throat or\nslightly upstream of the throat and the lowest value is usually near the nozzle exit.\n\nThe heat transfer intensity in chemical rocket propulsion can vary from less\nthan 50 W/cm? or 0.3 Btu/in.?-sec to over 16 kW/cm? or 100 Btu/in.?-sec. The\nhigh values are for the nozzle throat region of large bipropellant thrust chambers\nand high-pressure solid rocket motors. The lower values are for gas generators,\nnozzle exit sections, or small thrust chambers at low chamber pressures.\nCooling of Thrust Chambers\nThe primary objective of cooling is to prevent the chamber and nozzle walls\nfrom becoming too hot, so they will no longer be able to withstand the imposed\nloads or stresses, thus causing the chamber or nozzle to fail. Most wall materials\nlose strength and become weaker as temperature is increased. These loads and\nstresses are discussed in the next section. With further heating, the walls would\nultimately fail or even melt. Cooling thus reduces the wall temperatures to an\nacceptable value.\n\nBasically, there are two cooling methods in common use today. The first is\nthe steady-state method. The heat transfer rate and the temperatures of the cham-\nbers reach thermal equilibrium. This includes regenerative cooling and radiation\ncooling. The duration is limited only by the available supply of propellant.\n\nRegenerative cooling is done by building a cooling jacket around the thrust\nchamber and circulating one of the liquid propellants (usually the fuel) through\nit before it is fed to the injector. This cooling technique is used primarily with\nbipropellant chambers of medium to large thrust. It has been effective in applica-\ntions with high chamber pressure and high heat transfer rates. Also, most injectors\nuse regenerative cooling on their hot faces.\n\nIn radiation cooling the chamber and/or nozzle have only a single wall made\nof high-temperature material, such as niobium or molybdenum. When it reaches\n",
    "307": "290 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nthermal equilibrium, this wall usually glows red or white hot and radiates heat\naway to the surroundings or to empty space. Radiation cooling is used with\nbipropellant and monopropellant thrusters, bipropellant and monopropellant gas\ngenerators, and for diverging nozzle exhaust sections beyond an area ratio of\nabout 6 to 10 in larger thrust chambers (see Fig. 8\u20142). A few small bipropellant\nthrusters are also radiation cooled. This cooling scheme has worked well with\nlower chamber pressures (less than 250 psi) and moderate heat transfer rates.\n\nThe second cooling method relies on transient heat transfer or unsteady heat\ntransfer. It is also called heat sink cooling. The thrust chamber does not reach a\nthermal equilibrium, and temperatures continue to increase with operating dura-\ntion. The heat-absorbing capacity of the metal hardware determines its maximum\nduration, which is usually short (a few seconds for an all-metal construction).\nThe rocket combustion operation has to be stopped just before any of the exposed\nwalls reaches a critical temperature at which it could fail. This method has mostly\nbeen used with low chamber pressures and low heat transfer rates. Heat sink cool-\ning of thrust chambers can also be done by absorbing heat in an inner liner made\nof an ablative material, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. Ablative materials burn\nor erode slowly and cumulative operating durations can be minutes. Ablative\nmaterials are used extensively in solid propellant rocket motors and will be dis-\ncussed further in Chapter 15. The analysis of both of these cooling methods is\ngiven in the next section of this chapter.\n\nFilm cooling and special insulation are supplementary techniques that are used\noccasionally with both methods to locally augment their cooling capability. All\nthese cooling methods will be described further in this chapter.\n\nCooling also helps to reduce the oxidation of the wall material and the rate\nat which walls would be eaten away. The rates of chemical oxidizing reactions\nbetween the hot gas and the wall material can increase dramatically with wall\ntemperature. This oxidation problem can be minimized not only by limiting the\nwall temperature but also by burning the liquid propellants at a mixture ratio\nwhere the percentage of aggressive gases in the hot gas (such as oxygen or\nhydroxyl) is very small, and by coating certain wall materials with an oxidation-\nresistant coating; for example, iridium has been coated on the inside of rhenium\nwalls.\n\nCooling with Steady-State Heat Transfer. Cooled thrust chambers have\nprovisions for cooling some or all metal parts coming into contact with hot gases,\nsuch as chamber walls, nozzle walls, and injector faces. Internal cooling passages,\ncooling jackets, or cooling coils permit the circulation of a coolant. Jackets can\nconsist of separate inner and outer walls or of an assembly of contoured, adjacent\ntubes (see Figs. 8\u20141 and 8-9). The inner wall confines the gases, and the spaces\nbetween the walls serve as the coolant passage. The nozzle throat region is\nusually the location that has the highest heat transfer intensity and is therefore\nthe most difficult to cool. For this reason the cooling jacket is often designed\nso that the coolant velocity is highest at the critical regions by restricting the\ncoolant passage cross section, and so that the fresh cold coolant enters the jacket\n",

While the selection of the coolant velocity and its variation\nalong the wall for any given thrust chamber design depends on heat transfer\nconsiderations, the selection of the coolant passage geometry often depends on\npressure loss, stresses, and manufacturing considerations. An axial flow cooling\nJacket, or a tubular wall, has a low hydraulic friction loss but is practical only\nfor large coolant flows (above approximately 9 kg/sec). For small coolant flows\nand small thrust units, the design tolerances of the cooling jacket width between\nthe inner and outer walls or the diameters of the tubes, become too small, or\nthe tolerances become prohibitive. Therefore, most small thrust chambers use\nradiation cooling or ablative materials.\n\nIn regenerative cooling the heat absorbed by the coolant is not wasted; it\naugments the initial energy content of the propellant prior to injection, increasing\nthe exhaust velocity slightly (0.1 to 1.5%). This method is called regenerative\ncooling because of the similarity to steam regenerators. The design of the tubular\nchamber and nozzle combines the advantages of a thin wall (good for reducing\nthermal stresses and high wall temperatures) and a cool, lightweight structure.\nTubes are formed to special shapes and contours (see Figs. 8\u20141 and 8\u20149), usually\nby hydraulic means, and then brazed, welded, or soldered together (see Ref. 8\u20143).\nIn order to take the gas pressure loads in hoop tension, they are reinforced on\nthe outside by high-strength bands or wires. While Fig. 8\u20149 shows alternate\ntubes for up and down flow, there are chambers where the fuel inlet manifold\nis downstream of the nozzle throat area and where the coolant flow is up and\ndown in the nozzle exit region, but unidirectionally up in the throat and chamber\nregions.\n\nRadiation cooling is another steady-state method of cooling. It is simple and\nis used extensively in the low heat transfer applications listed previously. Fur-\nther discussion of radiation cooling is given in Section 8.4. In order for heat to\nbe radiated into space, it is usually necessary for the bare nozzle and chamber\n",
    "309": "292 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nto stick out of the vehicle. Figure 8-16 shows a radiation-cooled thrust cham-\nber. Since the white hot glowing radiation-cooled chambers and/or nozzles are\npotent radiators, they may cause undesirable heating of adjacent vehicle or engine\ncomponents. Therefore, many have insulation (see Fig. 8\u201413) or simple exter-\nnal radiation shields to minimize these thermal effects; however, in these cases\nthe actual chamber or nozzle wall temperatures are higher than they would be\nwithout the insulation or shielding.\n\nCooling with Transient Heat Transfer. Thrust chambers with unsteady heat\ntransfer are basically of two types. One is a simple metal chamber (steel, copper,\nstainless steel, etc.) made with walls sufficiently thick to absorb plenty of heat\nenergy. For short-duration testing of injectors, testing of new propellants, rating\ncombustion stability, and very short duration rocket-propelled missiles, such as\nan antitank weapon, a heavy-walled simple, short-duration steel chamber is often\nused. The common method of ablative cooling or heat sink cooling uses a combi-\nnation of endothermic reactions (breakdown or distillation of matrix material into\nsmaller compounds and gases), pyrolysis of organic materials, counter-current\nheat flow and coolant gas mass flow, charring, and localized melting. An abla-\ntive material usually consists of a series of strong, oriented fibers (such as glass,\nKevlar, or carbon fibers) engulfed by a matrix of an organic binder material (such\nas plastics, epoxy resins or phenolic resins). As shown in Fig. 15\u201411, the gases\nseep out of the matrix and form a protective film cooling layer on the inner wall\nsurfaces. The fibers and the residues of the matrix form a hard char or porous\ncoke-like material that preserves the wall contour shapes.\n\nThe orientation, number, and type of fiber determine the ability of the com-\nposite ablative material to withstand significant stresses in preferred directions.\nFor example, internal pressure produces longitudinal as well as hoop stresses in\nthe thrust chamber walls and thermal stresses produce compression on the inside\nof the walls and tensile stresses on the outside. We have learned how to place the\nfibers in two or three directions, which makes them anisotropic. We then speak\nof two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D fiber orientation.\n\nA set of strong carbon fibers in a matrix of amorphous carbon is a special,\nbut favorite type of material. It is often abbreviated as C\u2014C or carbon-carbon.\nThe carbon materials lose their ability to carry loads at a high temperature of\nabout 3700 K or 6200 F. Carbon oxidizes readily form CO or COz. Its best\napplications are with fuel-rich propellant mixtures that have little or no free\noxygen or hydroxyl in their exhaust. It has also been used for nozzle throat\ninserts. Properties for one type of C\u2014C are given in Table 15-5. A C-C nozzle\nextension is shown in Fig. 8-17. See Ref. 8-4.\n\nAblative cooling was first used and is still used extensively with solid pro-\npellant rocket motors. It has since been successfully applied to liquid propel-\nlant thrust chambers, particularly at low chamber pressure, where the static gas\ntemperatures are relatively low. It is still used today as a material for nozzle\nextensions, such as for the RS-68 in Fig. 6\u201410, and it can operate for several\nminutes. It is also used as a chamber and nozzle liner at low chamber pres-\nsure. An example is the axial gimbaled thruster of the Peacekeeper fourth stage\n",

Ablative lined small thrusters (100 Ibf thrust or\nless) have been flown extensively in the 1950s and 1960s in Apollo missions\nand other applications for attitude control and minor maneuvers. They are no\nlonger used today because they are relatively heavy and because the eroded par-\nticle, droplets, or certain gases in the exhaust plume deposit condense on optical\nsurfaces of spacecraft (mirror, solar cells, or windows).\n\nIt is often advantageous to use a different cooling method for the downstream\n\npart of the diverging nozzle section, because its heat transfer rate per unit area\nis usually much lower than in the chamber or the converging nozzle section,\nparticularly with nozzles of large area ratio. There is usually a small saving in\ninert engine mass, a small increase in performance, and a cost saving, if the\nchamber and the converging nozzle section and the throat region (up to an area\nratio of perhaps 5 to 10) use regenerative cooling and the remainder of the nozzle\nexit section is radiation cooled (or sometimes ablative cooled). See Fig. 8\u20142 and\nRef. 8-4.\nFilm Cooling. This is an auxiliary method applied to chambers and/or nozzles,\naugmenting either a marginal steady-state or a transient cooling method. It can\nbe applied to a complete thrust chamber or just to the nozzle, where heat transfer\nis the highest. Film cooling is a method of cooling whereby a relatively cool\nthin fluid film covers and protects exposed wall surfaces from excessive heat\ntransfer. Figure 8\u201410 shows film-cooled chambers. The film can be introduced\nby injecting small quantities of fuel or an inert fluid at very low velocity through\na large number of orifices along the exposed surfaces in such a manner that a\nprotective relatively cool gas film or cool boundary layer is formed. In liquid\npropellant rocket engines extra fuel can also be admitted through extra injection\nholes at the outer layers of the injector; thus a propellant mixture is achieved (at\nthe periphery of the chamber), which has a much lower combustion temperature.\nThis differs from film cooling or transpiration cooling because there does not\nhave to be a chamber cooling jacket or film-cooling manifolds.\n\nFilm cooling by itself (without another cooling method) has been very effective\nin keeping chamber and nozzle materials from becoming too hot. In fact the very\nfirst thrust chambers developed by Robert H. Goddard in the 1920s were film\ncooled. However, the film coolant is not burned effectively and there was a 5\nto 17% reduction in specific impulse. Therefore, today, film cooling is used in\nsmall quantities (1 to 6% of fuel) to locally supplement other cooling methods\nand the performance loss is 0.5 to 2%. In solid propellant rocket engines this\nfilm cooling can be accomplished by inserting a ring of cool-burning propellant\nupstream of the nozzle, as shown in Fig. 8\u201410 or by wall insulation materials,\nwhose ablation and charring will release relatively cool gases into the boundary\nlayer.\n\nTurbine discharge gas (400 to 800\u00b0C or 752 to 1972\u00b0F) has also been used as\na film coolant for uncooled nozzle exit sections of large liquid propellant rocket\nengines. Of course, the injection of an annular gas layer at the periphery of the\nnozzle exit, at a temperature lower than the maximum possible value, causes\n",

Therefore, it is desirable to reduce both the\nthickness of this cooler layer and the mass flow of cooler gas, relative to the\ntotal flow, to a practical minimum value at which cooling will still be effective.\n\nA special type of film cooling, sweat cooling or transpiration cooling, uses\na porous wall material which admits a coolant through pores uniformly over the\nsurface. This technique has been successfully used to cool injector faces in the\nupper stage engine (J-2) of the moon launch vehicle and the Space Shuttle main\nengine (SSME) with hydrogen fuel.\nThermal Insulation. Theoretically, a good thermal insulation layer on the gas\nside of the chamber wall can be very effective in reducing chamber wall heat\ntransfer and wall temperatures. However, efforts with good insulation materials\nsuch as refractory oxides or ceramic carbides have usually not been success-\nful. They will not withstand differential thermal expansion without cracking or\nspalling. A sharp edge on the surface (crack or flaked-off piece of insulator)\nwill cause a sudden rise in the stagnation temperature and most likely lead to\na local wall failure. Asbestos is a good insulator and was used several decades\nago; because it is a cancer-causing agent, it is no longer used. Coating develop-\nment efforts with rhenium and other materials are continuing. Insulation or heat\nshields have been successfully applied on the exterior of radiation-cooled thrust\nchambers to reduce the heat transfer from the hot thrust chamber wall to adjacent\nsensitive equipment or structures.\n\nWith hydrocarbon fuels it is possible to form small carbon particles or soot in\nthe hot gas and that can lead to a carbon deposit on the gas side of the chamber\n",

More likely it forms hard, caked deposits,\nwhich can be spalled off in localized flakes and form sharp edges, and then it is\nundesirable. Most designers have preferred instead to use film cooling or extra\nhigh coolant velocities in the cooling jacket with injectors that do not create\nadhesive soot.\n\nHydraulic Losses in the Cooling Passage\n\nThe cooling coil or cooling jacket should be designed so that the fluid adsorbs all\nthe heat transferred across the inner motor wall, and so that the coolant pressure\ndrop will be small.\n\nA higher pressure drop allows a higher coolant velocity in the cooling jacket,\nwill do a better job of cooling, but requires a heavier feed system, which increases\nthe engine mass slightly and thus also the total inert vehicle mass. For many\nliquid propellant rockets the coolant velocity in the chamber is approximately\n3 to 10 m/sec or 10 to 33 ft/sec and, at the nozzle throat, 6 to 24 m/sec or 20 to\n80 ft/sec.\n\nA cooling passage can be considered to be a hydraulic pipe, and the friction\nloss can be calculated accordingly. For a straight pipe,\n\nAp/p = 5 fv(L/D) (8-11)\nwhere Ap is the friction pressure loss, p the coolant mass density, L the length of\ncoolant passage, D the equivalent diameter, v the average velocity in the cooling\npassage, and f the friction loss coefficient. In English engineering units the right\nside of the equation has to be divided by go, the sea-level acceleration of gravity\n(32.2 ft/sec\u201d). The friction loss coefficient is a function of Reynolds number and\nhas values between 0.02 and 0.05. A typical pressure loss of a cooling jacket is\nbetween 5 and 25% of the chamber pressure.\n\nA large portion of the pressure drop in a cooling jacket usually occurs in those\nlocations where the flow direction or the flow-passage cross section is changed.\nHere the sudden expansion or contraction causes a loss, sometimes larger than\nthe velocity head v?/2. This hydraulic situation exists in inlet and outlet chamber\nmanifolds, injector passages, valves, and expansion joints.\n\nThe pressure loss in the cooling passages of a thrust chamber can be calculated,\nbut more often it is measured. This pressure loss is usually determined in cold\nflow tests (with an inert fluid instead of the propellant and without combustion),\nand then the measured value is corrected for the actual propellant (different phys-\nical properties) and the hot firing conditions; a higher temperature will change\npropellant densities or viscosities and in some designs it changes the cross section\nof cooling flow passages.\n\nThrust Chamber Wall Loads and Stresses\nThe analysis of loads and stresses is performed on all propulsion components\nduring their engineering design. Its purpose is to assure the propulsion designer\n",

In this section we concentrate\non the loads and stresses in the walls of thrust chambers, where high heat fluxes\nand large thermal stresses complicate the stress analysis. Some of the information\non safety factors and stress analysis apply also to all propulsion systems, including\nsolid propellant motors and electric propulsion.\n\nThe safety factors (really margins for ignorance) are very small in rocket\npropulsion when compared to commercial machinery, where these factors can\nbe 2 to 6 times larger. Several load conditions are considered for each rocket\ncomponent; they are:\n\n1. Maximum expected working load is the largest likely operating load under\nall likely operating conditions or transients. Examples are operating at a\nslightly higher chamber pressure than nominal as set by tolerances in design\nor fabrication (an example is the tolerance in setting the tank pressure\nregulator) or the likely transient overpressure from ignition shock.\n\n2. The design limit load is typically 1.20 times the maximum expected work-\ning load, to provide a margin. If the variation in material composition,\nmaterial properties, the uncertainties in the method of stress analysis, or\npredicted loads are significant, a larger factor may be selected.\n\n3. The damaging load can be based on the yield load or the ultimate load\nor the endurance limit load, whichever gives the lowest value. The yield\nload causes a permanent set or deformation, and it is typically set as 1.10\ntimes the design limit load. The endurance limit may be set by fatigue or\ncreep considerations (such as in pulsing). The ultimate load induces a stress\nequal to the ultimate strength of the material, where significant elongation\nand area reduction can lead to failure. Typically, it is set as 1.50 times the\ndesign limit load.\n\n4. The proof test load is applied to engines or their components during devel-\nopment and manufacturing inspection. It is often equal to the design limit\nload, provided this load condition can be simulated in a laboratory. Thrust\nchambers and other components, whose high thermal stresses are difficult\nto simulate, use actual hot firing tests to obtain this proof, often with loads\nthat approach the design limit load (e.g., higher than nominal chamber\npressure or a mixture ratio that results in hotter gas).\n\nThe walls of all thrust chambers are subjected to radial and axial loads from\nthe chamber pressure, flight accelerations (axial and transverse), vibration, and\nthermal stresses. They also have to withstand a momentary ignition pressure\nsurge or shock, often due to excessive propellant accumulation in the chamber.\nThis surge can exceed the nominal chamber pressure. In addition, the chamber\nwalls have to transmit thrust loads as well as forces and in some applications\nalso moments, imposed by thrust vector control devices described in Chapter 18.\n",
    "314": "8.2. COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND NOZZLE 297\nWalls also have to survive a \u201cthermal shock,\u201d namely, the initial thermal stresses\nat rapid starting. When walls are cold or at ambient temperature, they experience\nhigher gas heating rates than after the walls have been heated. These loads are\ndifferent for almost every design, and each unit has to be considered individually\nin determining the wall strengths.\n\nA heat transfer analysis is usually done only for the most critical wall regions,\nsuch as at and near the nozzle throat, at a critical location in the chamber, and\nsometimes at the nozzle exit. The thermal stresses induced by the temperature\ndifference across the wall are often the most severe stresses and a change in\nheat transfer or wall temperature distribution will affect the stresses in the wall.\nSpecific failure criteria (wall temperature limit, reaching yield stress, or maximum\ncoolant temperature, etc.) have to be established for these analyses.\n\nThe temperature differential across a chamber wall introduces a compressive\nstress on the inside and a tensile stress on the outside of the inner wall; the stress\ns can be calculated for simple cylindrical chamber walls that are thin in relation\nto their radius as\n\ns =2XE AT/(1\u2014v) (8-12)\nwhere 2 is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the wall material, E the\nmodulus of elasticity of the wall material, AT the temperature drop across the\nwall, and v the Poisson ratio of the wall material. Temperature stresses frequently\nexceed the yield point. The materials experience a change in the yield strength and\nthe modulus of elasticity with temperature. The preceding equation is applicable\nonly to elastic deformations. This yielding of rocket thrust chamber wall materials\ncan be observed by the small and gradual contraction of the throat diameter after\neach operation (perhaps 0.05% reduction in throat diameter after each firing) and\nthe formation of progressive cracks of the inside wall surface of the chamber and\nthroat after successive runs. These phenomena limit the useful life and number\nof starts or temperature cycles of a thrust chamber (see Refs. 8-5 and 8-6).\n\nIn selecting a working stress for the wall material of a thrust chamber, the\nvariation of strength with temperature and the temperature stresses over the wall\nthickness have to be considered. The temperature drop across the inner wall is\ntypically between 50 and 550 K, and an average temperature is sometimes used\nfor estimating the material properties. The most severe thermal stresses can occur\nduring the start, when the hot gases cause thermal shock to the hardware. These\ntransient thermal gradients cause severe thermal strain and local yielding.\n\nA picture of a typical steady-state stress distribution caused by pressure loads\nand thermal gradients is shown in Fig. 8\u201411. Here the inner wall is subjected to a\ncompressive pressure differential caused by a high liquid pressure in the cooling\njacket and a relatively large temperature gradient. In a large rocket chamber,\nsuch as is used in the Redstone missile or the German V-2, the wall thickness\nof the nozzle steel way may be 7 mm and the temperature differential across it\nmay readily exceed several hundred degrees. This temperature gradient causes\nthe hot inner wall surface to expand more than the wall surface on the coolant\n",

In these thick walls the stress\ninduced by the pressure load is usually small compared to the thermal stress.\nThe resultant stress distribution in thick inner walls (shown shaded in the sample\nstress diagram of Fig. 8-11) indicates that the stress in the third of the wall\nadjacent to the hot gases has exceeded the yield point. Because the modulus of\nelasticity and the yield point diminish with temperature, the stress distribution is\nnot linear over the yielded portion of the wall. In effect, this inner portion acts\nas a heat shield for the outer portion which carries the load.\n\nBecause of the differential expansion between the hot inner shell and the\nrelatively cold outer shell, it is necessary to provide for axial expansion joints to\nprevent severe temperature stresses. This is particularly critical in larger double-\nwalled thrust chambers.

The tubes have to hold the internal coolant pressure, absorb the\nthermal stresses, and contain the gas pressure in the chamber. The hottest tem-\nperature occurs in the center of the outer surface of that portion of each tube\nexposed to hot gas. The thermal stresses are relatively low, since the temperature\ngradient is small; copper has a high conductivity and the walls are relatively thin\n(0.5 to 2 mm). The coolant pressure-induced load on the tubes is relatively high,\nparticularly if the thrust chamber operates at high chamber pressure. The inter-\nnal coolant pressure tends to separate the tubes. The gas pressure loads in the\nchamber are usually taken by reinforcing bands which are put over the outside\nof the tubular jacket assembly (see Figs. 8\u20141 and 8-9). The joints between the\ntubes have to be gas tight and this can be accomplished by soldering, welding,\nor brazing.\n\nWhen a high-area-ratio nozzle is operated at high ambient pressure (sea level\nor low altitude), the lower part of the nozzle structure experiences a compression\nbecause the pressure in the nozzle near the exit is actually below atmospheric\nvalue. Therefore, high-area-ratio nozzles usually have stiffening rings on the\noutside of the nozzle near the exit to maintain a circular shape and thus prevent\nbuckling, flutter, or thrust misalignment.\n\nAerospike Thrust Chamber\n\nA separate category comprises thrust chambers using a center body, such as a\nplug nozzle or aerospike nozzle. They have more surface to cool than ordinary\nthrust chambers. A circular aerospike thruster is described in Chapter 3 and\nshown schematically in Figs. 3\u201412 and 8-12 and described in Ref. 8\u20147. Here the\ndiameter of the exhaust flow plume increases with altitude. Each individual small\n(regeneratively cooled) thrust chamber or cell has its own cylindrical combustion\nchamber, a circular small nozzle throat, but a rectangular nozzle exit of low area\nratio. The gas from these rectangular nozzle exits is further expanded (and thus\nreaches a higher exhaust velocity) along the contour of the spike or ramp. The flat\nsurface at the bottom or base is porous or full of small holes and a low-pressure\ngas flows through these openings. This causes a back pressure on the flat base\nsurface. This flow can be the exhaust gas from the turbopumps of an engine\nwith a gas generator cycle; it is typically 1 or 2% of the total flow. The gas\nregion below this base is enclosed by gas flows from the ramps. A linear version\nof a truncated (shortened) aerospike engine with two opposing ramps has been\ndeveloped using LOX/LH) propellants at a thrust level of about 200,000 Ibf and\nthe ground tests were satisfactory. It has two fuel-cooled side plates. Except for\na flight of a very small, inefficient, truncated experimental aerospike, none of\nthese liquid propellant engines have flown.\n\nThe thrust of this aerospike thrust chamber consists of (1) the axial component\nthrusts of each of the little chamber modules or cells, (2) the integral of the\npressures acting on the ramps over the axially projected area normal to the axis\nof the ramps, and (3) the pressure acting over the base area.\n",

Figure 8\u201412 shows a typical pressure\ndistribution on a typical ramp surface and the flow patterns for low and high\naltitude. The hot gas flows coming out of the cell nozzles are turned into a nearly\naxial direction by multiple expansion waves (shown as dashed lines), which\ncause a reduction in pressure. At lower altitudes the turning causes compression\nshock waves (represented as solid lines), which causes local pressures to rise.\nThe compression waves are reflected off the boundary between the hot gas jet\nand the ambient airstream, creating further expansion waves. At high altitude\nthere are no compression waves emanating from the ramp and the expanding\ndiverging flow exerts a decreasing pressure on the ramp area and behaves very\nsimilarly to the diverging nozzle flow in a bell-shaped conventional nozzle exit\nsection. The contact locations, where the compression waves touch the ramp\nsurface, have higher local heat transfer than other areas on the ramp surface; these\n",

The wave patterns and\nthe pressure distribution on the spike or ramp surface can be determined from\ncomputerized fluid dynamics programs or a method of characteristics program.\n\nThe advantages claimed for an aerospike engine are these: (1) Compared to\nrocket engines with conventional axisymmetric nozzles, the truncated aerospike\nis very short (about one third the length), and this also reduces the vehicle length\nand vehicle structure mass; (2) it has altitude compensation and thus operates at\noptimum nozzle expansion and highest possible exhaust velocity at every altitude;\nand (3) differential throttling of certain sets of individual thruster modules or cells\nallows pitch and yaw control, and with two engines it also allows roll control of\nthe vehicle during powered flight, as explained in Chapter 18. There is no gimbal\njoint, no movement of the nozzle, no actuators, and no actuator power supply or\nstrong structural locations for actuator side loads. The disadvantages include the\nlack of proven flight experience, proven reliability and performance validation,\nand a larger-than-usual surface area subject to high heat transfer. There are some\nsmall performance losses as the supersonic gas flow goes from a round nozzle\nthroat of each cell into a rectangular nozzle exit of the cell, also in turning the\nflow on the ramp, and in combining supersonic flow from adjacent cell nozzles.\nThe average total loss with liquid propellants is believed to be about 1% of\nthe specific impulse. For combustion gases, which contain small particulates\n(e.g., gases from solid composite propellant explained in Chapter 13), the losses\nwill be higher\u2014up to 7%\u2014depending on the percentage of particulates (which\nare tiny solid particles and/or small liquid droplets). Due to the inertia of the\nparticulates, they can only be turned through a small angle in a high-speed gas\nflow and they will hit the nozzle walls. The mass flow distribution will be uneven\nwith the heavy particulates mostly in the gas layers next to the concave curved\nnozzle walls. Ref. 8-8 gives an example, which did not recognize the loss from\nparticulates.\n\n8.3. LOW-THRUST ROCKET THRUST CHAMBERS OR THRUSTERS\nSpacecraft, certain tactical missiles, missile defense vehicles, and upper stages of\nballistic missiles often use special, multiple thrusters in their small, liquid pro-\npellant rocket engines. They generally have thrust levels between about 0.5 and\n10,000 N or 0.1 to 2200 Ibf, depending on vehicle size and mission. As mentioned\nin Section 4.5, they are used for trajectory corrections, attitude control, docking,\nterminal velocity control in spacecraft or ballistic missiles, divert or side move-\nment, propellant settling, and other functions. Most operate with multiple restarts\nfor relatively short durations during a major part of their duty cycle. As mentioned\nin Section 6.7, they can be classified into hot gas thrusters (high-performance\nbipropellant with combustion temperatures above 2600 K and vacuum J, of 230\nto 325 sec), warm gas thrusters such as monopropellant hydrazine (temperatures\nbetween 500 and 1600 K and /, of 180 to 245 sec), and cold gas thrusters such\nas high-pressure stored nitrogen (200 to 320 K) with low specific impules (40 to\n120 sec).\n",
    "319": "302 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nA typical small thruster for bipropellant is shown in Fig. 8-13 and for\nhydrazine monopropellant in Fig. 8-14. For attitude control angular motions\nthese thrust chambers are usually arranged in pairs as explained in Section 4.5.\nThe same control signal activates the valves for both units of such a pair. All\nthese small space rocket systems use a pressurized feed system, some with pos-\nitive expulsion provisions, as explained in Section 6.2. The vehicle mission and\nthe automatic control system of the vehicle often require irregular and frequent\npulses to be applied by pairs of attitude control thrust chambers, which often\noperate for very short periods (as low as 0.01 to 0.02 sec). This type of frequent\nand short-duration thrust application is also known as pulsed thrust operation.\nFor translation maneuvers a single thruster can be fired (often in a pulsing mode)\nand the thrust axis usually goes through the center of gravity of the vehicle. The\nresulting acceleration will depend on the thrust and the location of the thruster\non the vehicle; it can be axial or at an angle to the flight velocity vector.\n\nThere is a performance degradation with decreasing pulse duration for all three\ntypes of thrusters, because propellants are used inefficiently during the buildup\nof thrust and the decay of thrust, when they operate below full chamber pressure\nand the nozzle expansion characteristics are not optimum.

This in turn often requires endurance proof\ntests of 400,000 to 800,000 cycles.\n\nThrottling or reducing the thrust is equivalent to reducing the total impulse\nover the operating duration. This can be achieved by varying (1) the time between\npulses (less total cumulative impulse per unit time) or (2) by limiting the total\nnumber of pulses.\n\nLiquid storable bipropellants such as NyO4-monomethylhydrazine are used\nwhen high performance is mandatory. Some have used ablative materials for\nthrust chamber construction, as in the Gemini command module. The Space\nShuttle small thrusters use radiation cooling with refractory metals, as shown\nin Fig. 8-13. A radiation-cooled thruster is shown later in Fig. 8-16. Carbon\nmaterials made of woven strong carbon fibers in a matrix of carbon have also\nbeen used in radiation-cooled bipropellant thrusters.\n\nHydrazine monopropellant thrusters are used when system simplicity is impor-\ntant and moderate performance is acceptable. They have a nontoxic, clear, clean\nexhaust plume. Virtually all hydrazine monopropellant attitude control rockets\nuse finely dispersed iridium or cobalt deposited on porous ceramic (aluminum\noxide) substrate pellets 1.5 to 3 mm in diameter as a catalyst. Figure 8\u201414 shows\na typical design of the catalyst pellet bed in an attitude control thruster designed\nfor pulse and steady-state operation meeting a specific duty cycle. Each injection\npassage is covered with a cylindrical screen section which extends into a part of\nthe catalyst bed and distributes the hydrazine propellant. Figure 8\u201414 also shows\nother successful types of hydrazine injector. Several arrangements of catalyst\nbeds are employed; some have spring-loading to keep the pellets firmly packed.\nHydrazine monopropellant thrust units range in size from 0.2 to 2500 N of thrust;\nthe scaling procedure is empirical and each size and design requires testing and\nretesting. The amount of ammonia decomposition, shown in Fig. 7\u20143, can be\ncontrolled by the design of the catalyst bed and its decomposition chamber.\n\nMechanical, thermal, and chemical problems arise in designing a catalyst bed\nfor igniting hydrazine, the more important of which are catalytic attrition and\ncatalyst poisoning. Catalytic attrition or physical loss of catalyst material stems\nfrom motion and abrasion of the pellets, with loss of very fine particles. Crushing\nof pellets can occur because of thermal expansion and momentary overpressure\nspikes. As explained in Chapter 7, the catalyst activity can also decline because of\npoisoning by trace quantities of contaminants present in commercial hydrazine,\nsuch as aniline, MMH, UDMH, sulfur, zinc, sodium, or iron. Some of these\ncontaminants come with the hydrazine and some are added by the materials\nused in the tanks, and propellant plumbing in the spacecraft. The high-purity\ngrade hydrazine has less than 0.003% aniline and less than 0.005% carbonaceous\nmaterial; it does not contaminate catalysts. Catalyst degradation, regardless of\ncause, produces ignition delays, overpressures, and pressure spikes, decreases\nthe specific impulse, and decreases the impulse bit per pulse in attitude control\nengines.\n",

Electrical postheating of the reaction gases from catalysis allows an\nincrease of the altitude specific impulse from 240 sec to about 290 or 300 sec.\nA number of these combination auxiliary thrusters have successfully flown on a\nvariety of satellite applications and are particularly suitable for spacecraft where\nelectrical power is available and extensive short-duration pulsing is needed.\n\nCold gas thrusters use stored high-pressure inert gas as the propellant; they\nand their performance were mentioned in Section 7.6 and their propellants and\nspecific impulses are listed in Table 7\u20143. They are simple, low cost, used with\npressurized feed systems, used for pulsing operations, and for low thrust and low\ntotal impulse. They can use aluminum or plastics for thrusters, valves, and piping.\nThe early versions of the Pegasus air-launched launch vehicle used them for roll\ncontrol. The advantages of cold gas systems are: (a) they are very reliable and\nhave been proven in space flights lasting more than 10 years; (b) the system is\nsimple and relatively inexpensive; (c) the ingredients are nontoxic; (d) no deposit\nor contamination on sensitive spacecraft surfaces, such as mirrors; (e) they are\nsafe; and (f) capable of random pulsing. The disadvantages are: (a) engines are\nrelatively heavy with poor propellant mass fractions (0.02 to 0.19); (b) the specific\nimpulses and vehicle velocity increments are low, when compared to mono- or\nbipropellant systems; and (c) relatively large volumes.\n\n8.4. MATERIALS AND FABRICATION\n\nThe choice of the material for the inner chamber wall in the chamber and the\nnozzle throat region, which are the critical locations, is influenced by the hot\ngases resulting from the burning of propellants, the maximum wall temperature,\nthe heat transfer, and the duty cycle. A large variety of material has been used.\nTable 8-3 lists typical selected materials for several applications, thrust sizes,\nand propellants. For high-performance, high heat transfer, regeneratively cooled\nthrust chambers a material with high thermal conductivity and a thin-wall design\nwill reduce the thermal stresses. Copper is an excellent conductor and it will not\nreally oxidize in fuel-rich noncorrosive gas mixtures. It is often used with oxygen\nand hydrogen below a mixture ratio of 6.0. The inner walls are therefore usually\nmade of a copper alloy (with small additions of zirconium, silver, or silicon),\nwhich has a conductivity not quite as good as pure (oxygen-free) copper but has\nimproved high-temperature strength.\n\nFigure 8-15 shows a partial section through five configurations of cooling\njackets. All involve curved or doubly curved components and precision fits for\ngood fastening or joining.

    "325": "308 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nThe depth and width of the cooling channels vary with the chamber pro-\nfile location and the local thrust chamber diameter. At the nozzle throat region\nthe heat transfer is the highest; therefore it is the location of the highest cool-\ning velocity; therefore the total cooling passage area at the throat region is the\nsmallest. Often two or sometimes three different cooling jacket constructions are\ndesigned into the same thrust chamber. Typically, the milled groove configuration\nis used for the nozzle throat region and other configurations are then used for the\nchamber and the nozzle exit regions.\n\nThe failure modes often are bulging on the hot wall on the gas side and the\nopening up of cracks. During hot firing, the strain at the hot surface can exceed\nthe local yield point, thus giving it a local permanent compressive deformation.\nWith the cooldown after operation and with each successive firing, some addi-\ntional yielding and further plastic deformation will occur until cracks form. With\nsuccessive firings the cracks can become deep enough for a leak of cooling pro-\npellant into the chamber or nozzle and the thrust chamber will then usually fail.\nThe useful life of a metal thrust chamber is the maximum number of firings\n(and sometimes also the cumulative firing duration) without such a failure. The\nprediction of wall failures is not simple and Refs. 8\u20145 and 8-6 explain this in\nmore detail. Useful life can also be limited by the storage life of soft compo-\nnents (O-rings, gaskets, valve stem lubricant) and, for small thrusters with many\npulses, also the fatigue of valve seats. Therefore, there is a maximum limit on\nthe number of firings that such a thrust chamber can withstand safely, and this\nlimits its useful life.\n\nFor radiation cooling, several different carbon materials have worked in a\nreducing, fuel-rich rocket combustion atmosphere. At leaner gas mixtures the\ncarbon can oxidize at the elevated temperatures when they glow red or white.\nThey can be used at wall temperatures up to perhaps 3300 K or 6000\u00b0R. Carbon\nmaterials and ablative materials are used extensively in solid propellant rocket\nmotors and are discussed further in Chapter 15.\n\nFor some small radiation-cooled bipropellant thrusters with storable propel-\nlants, such as those of the reaction control thrusters on the Space Shuttle orbiter,\nthe hot walls are made of niobium coated with disilicide (up to 1120 K or\n2050\u00b0R). To prevent damage, a fuel-rich mixture or film cooling is often used.\nFor small thrusters rhenium walls protected by iridium coatings (oxidation resis-\ntant) have come into use more recently and have been used up to about 2300 K or\n4100\u00b0R (see Refs. 8\u20141 and 8-9). Other high-temperature materials, such as tung-\nsten, molybdenum, alumina, or tantalum, have been tried but have had problems\nin manufacture, cracking, hydrogen embrittlement, or excessive oxidation.\n\nA small radiation-cooled bipropellant thruster is shown in Fig. 8-16. It uses\nthree different nozzle and chamber materials. This thruster\u2019s injector has extra\nfuel injection holes (not shown in Fig. 8-16) to provide film cooling to keep wall\ntemperatures below their failure limits.

Progress in manufacturing equipment and technology has now made it\npossible to build and fly larger pieces made of carbon fiber in a carbon matrix. A\nthree-piece extendible carbon nozzle exit cone of 2.3 m (84 in.) diameter and 2.3\nto 3 mm thickness has flown on an upper-stage engine.

This evaluation includes\nphysical properties, such as tensile and compressive strengths, yield strength, frac-\nture toughness, modulus of elasticity (for determining deflections under load),\nthermal conductivity (a high value is best for steady-state heat transfer), coef-\nficient of thermal expansion (some large thrust chambers grow by 3 to 10 mm\nwhen they become hot, and that can cause problems with their piping connec-\ntions or structural supports), specific heat (capacity to absorb thermal energy),\nreflectivity (for radiation), or density (ablatives require more volume than steel).\n",

The\ntemperature where a material loses perhaps 60 to 75% of its room temperature\nstrength is often selected as the maximum allowable wall temperature, well below\nits melting point. Since a listing of all the key properties of a single material\nrequires many pages, it is not possible to list them here, but they are usually\navailable from manufacturers and other sources. Other important properties are\nerosion resistance, little or no chemical reactions with the propellants or the hot\ngases, reproducible decomposition or vaporization of ablative materials, ease and\nlow cost of fabrication (welding, cutting, forming, etc.), the consistency of the\ncomposition (impurities) of different batches of each material (metals, organics,\nseals, insulators, lubricants, cleaning fluids), and ready availability and low cost\nof each material.\n8.5. HEAT TRANSFER ANALYSIS\nIn actual rocket development not only is the heat transfer analyzed but the rocket\nunits are almost always tested to assure that heat is transferred satisfactorily under\nall operating and emergency conditions. Heat transfer calculations are useful to\nguide the design, testing, and failure investigations. Those rocket combustion\ndevices that are regeneratively cooled or radiation cooled can reach thermal equi-\nlibrium and the steady-state heat transfer relationships will apply. Transient heat\ntransfer conditions apply not only during thrust buildup (starting) and shutdown\nof all rocket propulsion systems, but also with cooling techniques that never\nreach equilibriurm, such as with ablative materials.\n\nSophisticated finite element analysis (FEA) programs of heat transfer have\nbeen available for at least 20 years, and several different FEA computer programs\nhave been used for the analysis of thrust chamber steady-state and transient\nheat transfer, with different chamber geometries or different materials and with\ntemperature-variant properties. A detailed description of this powerful analysis\nis beyond the scope of this book, but can be found in Refs. 8-10, 8-11, and\n8-12. Major rocket propulsion organizations have developed their own versions\nof suitable computer programs for solving their heat transfer problems. This\nsection gives the basic relationships that are the foundation for FEA programs.\nThey are intended to give some understanding of the phenomena and underlying\nprinciples.\n\nGeneral Steady-State Heat Transfer Relations\n\nFor heat transfer conduction the following general relation applies:\nQ dT AT\n= = -\u2014K\u2014 = \u2014\u00ab \u2014 (8-13)\nA dty ty\n",

The\nnegative sign indicates that temperature decreases as thickness increases.\n\nThe steady-state heat transfer through the chamber wall of a liqud-cooled\nrocket chamber can be treated as a series-type, steady-state heat transfer problem\nwith a large temperature gradient across the gaseous film on the inside of the\nchamber wall, a temperature drop across the wall, and, in cases of cooled cham-\nbers, a third temperature drop across the film of the moving cooling fluid.

The strength and thermal properties of\nmaterials are functions of temperature. Any consistent set of units can be used\nin these equations. These simple relations assume that the heat flow is radial.\nThe simple quasi-one-dimensional theory also often assumes that the thermal\nconductivity and the film coefficients are at average values and not functions\nof temperature or pressure. A two- or three-dimensional finite element model\nwould also need to be used to analyze the heat transfer in the axial directions,\nwhich usually occurs in the nozzle throat wall regions; some of the heat from\nthe hot nozzle throat is transferred to wall regions upstream and downstream of\nthe throat.\n\nBecause the film coefficients, the gas and liquid coolant temperatures, the wall\nthickness, and the surface areas usually vary with the axial distance L within\na combustion chamber (assuming axial heat transfer symmetry), the total heat\ntransfer per unit time Q can be found by integrating the local heat transfer over\nthe entire internal surface area of the chamber and the nozzle:\n\n= fadr=n [ dg at (8-19)\n\nBecause both qg and D are complicated functions of the thrust chamber length\nL, the equation usually has to be solved by dividing the rocket chamber into finite\nlengths. Assuming that qg is given by Eqs. 8-13 to 8-19 and remains constant\nover the length of each element gives an approximate solution.\n\nThe important quantities for controlling the heat transfer across a rocket cham-\nber wall are the fluid film boundaries established by the combustion products on\none side of the wall and the coolant flow on the other. The gas film coefficient\nlargely determines the numerical value of the heat transfer rate, and the liquid\nfilm largely determines the value of the wall temperatures. The determination of\nthe film coefficients in Eqs. 8-16 and 8-18 is difficult because of the complex\ngeometries, the nonuniform velocity profile, the surface roughness, the boundary\nlayer behavior, and the combustion oscillations.\n\nConventional heat transfer theory is usually given in terms of several dimen-\nsionless parameters (Ref. 8-10, 8-11, and 8-12):\n\n0.8\nheP _ 9.026 (7) (Hey (8-20)\nK bh K\nwhere hg is the film coefficient, D the diameter of the chamber of the nozzle,\nv the calculated average local gas velocity, \u00ab the conductivity of the gas, yz the\nabsolute gas viscosity, c, the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure, and p\nthe gas density.\n\nIn Eq. 8\u201420 the quantity hgD/\u00ab is known as the Nusselt number, the quantity\n\nDvp/w as the Reynolds number, and the quantity c,/\u00ab as the Prandtl number\n",

The\nboundary layer temperature gradient has effects on the various gas properties in\nrocket combustion, Conventional theoretical approaches, such as for Eq. 8\u201420\nor 8-21, are usually for heated circular tubes, relatively long tubes, steady-state\nflow, and they reach an equilibrium velocity profile. Heat flows into the tube from\nall sides (360\u00b0). However, in thrust chambers the heat flow to the coolant passage\nis only on one side of the cooling passage and the combustion phenomena are\npropellant specific. The chamber length is relatively short, and an equilibrium\nflow profile does not exist. The actual flow in the combustion chamber is highly\nturbulent. There are liquid droplets, which evaporate, and there is no equilibrium.\nFor these reasons Eqs. 8\u201420 and 8\u201421 an approximations only.\n\nEquations where the coefficients have been validated by actual experimen-\ntal data are more reliable and they are used in design.

Again, the empirical constant\n0.026 is dimensionless when compatible dimensions are used for the other terms.\nThe gas velocity v is the local free-stream velocity corresponding to the density\np\u2019. Since density raised to the 0.8 power is roughly proportional to the pressure\nand the gas film coefficient is roughly proportional to the heat flux, it follows that\nthe heat transfer rate increases approximately linearly with the chamber pressure.\nThese semiempirical heat transfer equations have been modified and validated\nfor common propellants, limited chamber pressure ranges, and specific injectors\n(see Ref. 8\u201413) and are often proprietary to specific design organizations.\n\nThe temperature drop across the inner wall and the maximum temperature are\nreduced if the wall is thin and is made of material of high thermal conductiv-\nity.

Thermal equilibrium is not reached.\nThe uncooled walls act essentially as a heat sponge and absorb heat from the hot\ngases. With the aid of experimental data to determine some typical coefficients,\nit is possible in some cases to predict the transient heating of uncooled walls.\n\nHeat is transferred from the hot gases to the wall, and during operation a\nchanging temperature gradient exists across the wall. The heat transferred from\nthe hot wall to the surrounding atmosphere, and by conduction of metal parts to\nthe structure, is negligibly small during this transient heating. Each local point\nwithin the wall has its temperature raised as the burning process is extended in\ntime. After the completion of the rocket\u2019s operation, the wall temperatures tend\nto equalize. A typical temperature\u2014time-\u2014location history is given in Fig. 8\u201420.\nHere the horizontal line at T = 21\u00b0C denotes the initial equilibrium condition\nof the wall before the rocket operates; the various curves show the temperature\nprofile across the wall at successive time intervals after initiation of combustion.\nThe line at T = 357\u00b0C shows an equilibrium temperature of the wall a finite time\nafter cutoff.\n\nThe heat transferred across the hot surface of the wall (and distributed within\nthe wall by conduction) must be less than the heat-absorbing capacity of the wall\nmaterial below the critical temperature. If heat transfer to the outside atmosphere\nand axially within the metal wall is neglected, this can be expressed in a simplified\nform:\n\nQO At = \u2014KA(dT /dL) At = mc AT (8-23)\nwhere Q is the heat per second transferred across an inner wall surface area A.\nEquation 8-14 shows that Q/A depends on the hot gas temperature, the wall\ntemperature, and the gas film coefficient.

This approach should\ninclude simulation for the pyrolysis, chemical decomposition, char depth, and\nout-gassing effects on film coefficient, and it requires good material property\ndata. Most simulations require some experimental data.\n\nSteady-State Transfer to Liquids in Cooling Jacket\n\nThe term regenerative cooling is used for rockets where one of the propellants is\ncirculated through cooling passages around the thrust chamber prior to the injec-\ntion and burning of this propellant in the chamber. It is really forced convection\nheat transfer. The term regenerative is perhaps not altogether appropriate here,\nand it bears little relation to the meaning given to it in steam turbine practice. It\nis intended to convey the fact that the heat absorbed by the coolant propellant is\nnot wasted but augments its initial temperature and raises its energy level before\nit passes through the injector. This increase in the internal energy of the liquid\npropellant can be calculated as a correction to the enthalpy of the propellant\n(see Chapter 5). However, the overall effect on rocket performance is usually\nvery slight. With some propellants the specific impulse can be 1% larger if the\npropellants are preheated through a temperature differential of 100 to 200\u00b0C.\nIn hydrogen-cooled thrust chambers and in small combustion chambers, where\nthe wall-surface-to-chamber volume ratio is relatively large, the temperature rise\nin the regenerative coolant will be high, and the resulting increase in specific\nimpulse is sometimes more than 1%.\n\nThe behavior of the liquid film is critical for controlling the wall temperatures\nin forced convection cooling of rocket devices at high heat fluxes (see Table 8-4\nand Refs. 8-10, 8-14, and 8-15). At least four different types of film appear\nto exit, as can be interpreted from Fig. 8-21. Here the heat transfer rate per\nunit of wall surface g is shown as a function of the difference between the wall\ntemperature on the liquid side 7,,; and the bulk temperature of the liquid 77.\n\n1. The normal forced convection region at low heat flux appears to have\n\na liquid boundary layer of predictable characteristics. It is indicated by\nregion A\u2014B in Fig. 8-21. Here the wall temperature is usually below the\nboiling point of the liquid at the cooling jacket pressure.

When the wall temperature T,,; exceeds the boiling point of the liquid by\nperhaps 10 to 50 K, small vapor bubbles form at the hot wall surface.\nThese small, nuclei-like bubbles cause local turbulence, break away from\nthe wall, and collapse in the cooler liquid. This phenomenon is known\nas nucleate boiling. The turbulence induced by the bubbles changes the\ncharacter of the liquid film and, augmented by the vaporization of some\nof the propellant, the heat transfer rate is increased without a proportional\nincrease in the temperature drop across the film, as can be seen by the steep\nslope B\u2014C of the curve in Fig. 8\u201421. If the pressure of the fluid is raised,\nthen the boiling point is also raised and the nucleate boiling region shifts to\nthe right, to B\u2019-C\u2019.

In Table 8-5 it can\nbe seen that hydrazine is a good heat absorber, but kerosene is poor (low\nmax and low critical pressure).\n\n3. As the heat transfer is increased further, the rate of bubble formation and\nthe bubble size become so great that the bubbles are unable to escape from\nthe wall rapidly enough. This reaction (shown as C\u2014D in Fig. 8-21) is\ncharacterized by an unstable gas film and is difficult to obtain reproducibly\nin tests. When a film consisting largely or completely of gas forms along\nthe hot wall surface, then this film acts as an insulation layer, causing a\ndecrease in heat flux and, usually, a rapid increase in wall temperature,\noften resulting in a burnout or melting of the wall material. The cooling\nflow system has to be designed to avoid this unstable gas film regime\n\n4. As the temperature difference across the film is further increased, the wall\ntemperatures reach values in which heat transfer by radiation becomes\nimportant. Region D\u2014E is not of interest to cooling jacket designers.\n\nCooling can also be accomplished by a fluid above its critical point with\ncoolants such as hydrogen. In this case there is no nucleate boiling and the heat\ntransfer increases with the temperature difference, as shown by the supercritical\n(dashed) line in Fig. 8-21. Liquid hydrogen is an excellent coolant, has a high\nspecific heat, and leaves no residues.\n\nChemical changes in the liquid can seriously influence the heat transfer from\nhot walls to liquids. Cracking of hydrocarbon fuel, with an attendant formation\nof insoluble gas, tends to reduce the maximum heat flux and thus promote failure\nmore readily. Hydrocarbon fuel coolants (methane, jet fuel) can break down and\nform solid, sticky carbon deposits inside the cooling channel, impeding the heat\ntransfer. Other factors influencing steady-state coolant heat transfer are gas radi-\nation to the wall, bends in the coolant passage, improper welds or manufacture,\nand flow oscillations caused by turbulence or combustion unsteadiness. Some\npropellants, such as hydrazine, can decompose spontaneously and explode in the\ncooling passage if they become too hot.\n\nTo achieve a good heat-absorbing capacity of the coolant, the pressure and\nthe coolant flow velocity are selected so that boiling is permitted locally, but the\nbulk of the coolant does not reach this boiling condition. The total heat rejected\nby the hot gases to the surface of the hot walls, as given by Eq. 8-14 must be\nless than that permitted by the temperature rise in the coolant, namely\n\ngA = Q =mt(T; \u2014 Tr) (8-25)\nwhere m is the coolant mass flow rate, \u00a2 the average specific heat of the liquid,\nT, the initial temperature of the coolant as it enters the cooling jacket, and T> its\nfinal temperature; Q is the rate of heat absorption per unit time; g is this same\nrate per unit heat transfer area A; T, should be below the boiling point prevailing\nat the cooling jacket pressure.\n",

    "339": "322 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nRadiation\n\nRadiation heat emission is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a gas, liquid,\nor solid body by the virtue of its temperature and at the expense of its inter-\nnal energy. It covers the wavelength range from 10,000 to 0.0001 tm, which\nincludes the visible range of 0.39 to 0.78 um. Radiation heat transfer occurs\nmost efficiently in a vacuum because there is no absorption by the intervening\nfluids.\n\nThe heat transmitted by the mechanism of radiation depends primarily on the\ntemperature of the radiating body and its surface condition. The second law of\nthermodynamics can be used to prove that the radiant energy E is a function of\nthe fourth power of the absolute temperature T:\n\nE = feoAT* (8-26)\nThe energy E radiated by a body is defined as a function of the emissivity e,\nwhich is a dimensionless factor for surface condition and material properties,\nthe Stefan\u2014Boltzmann constant 0 (5.67 x 1078 W/m?-K*), the surface area A,\nthe absolute temperature T, and the geometric factor f, which depends on the\narrangement of adjacent parts and the shape. At low wall temperatures (below\n800 K) radiation accounts for only a negligible portion of the total heat transfer\nin a rocket device and can usually be neglected.\n\nIn rocket propulsion there are these radiation concerns:\n\n1. Emission of hot gases to the internal walls of a combustion chamber, and its\nnozzle converging section, a solid propellant grain, or a hybrid propellant\ngrain.\n\n2. Emission to the surroundings or to space from the external surfaces of\nhot hardware (radiation-cooled chambers, nozzles, or electrodes in electric\npropulsion).\n\n3. Radiation from the hot plume downstream of the nozzle exit. This is\ndescribed in Chapter 20.\n\nIn rocket combustion devices gas temperatures are between 1900 and 3900 K\nor about 3000 to 6600\u00b0F; their radiation contributes between 3 and 40% of the\nheat transfer to the chamber walls, depending on the reaction gas composition,\nchamber size, geometry, and temperature. It can be a significant portion of the\ntotal heat transfer. In solid propellant motors the radiation heating of the grain\nsurfaces can be critical to the burning rate, as discussed in Chapter 12. The\nabsorption of radiation on the wall follows essentially the same laws as those of\nemission. Metal surfaces and formed tubes reflect much of the radiant energy,\nwhereas ablative materials and solid propellants seem to absorb most of the\nincident radiation. A highly reflective surface on the inside wall of a combustor\ntends to reduce absorption and to minimize the temperature increase of the walls.\n\nThe hot reaction gases in rocket combustion chambers are potent radiation\nsources. Gases with symmetrical molecules, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and\n",

Also, they do not\nreally absorb much radiation and do not contribute considerable energy to the\nheat transfer. Heteropolar gases, such as water vapor, carbon monoxide, car-\nbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrocarbons, ammonia, oxides of nitrogen, and\nthe alcohols, have strong emission bands of known wavelengths. The radiation of\nenergy of these molecules is associated with the quantum changes in their energy\nlevels of rotation and interatomic vibration. In general, the radiation intensity of\nall gases increases with their volume, partial pressure, and the fourth power of\ntheir absolute temperature. For small thrust chambers and low chamber pressures,\nradiation contributes only a small amount of energy to the overall heat transfer.\n\nIf the hot reaction gases contain small solid particles or liquid droplets, then\nthe radiation heat transfer can increase dramatically by a factor of 2 to 10. The\nparticulates greatly increase the radiant energy as explained in Section 20.1. For\nexample, the reaction gas from a gelled liquid propellants contains small solid\nparticles and many solid propellants contain fine aluminum powder. When burned\nto form aluminum oxide, the heat of combustion and the combustion temperature\nare increased (raising heat transfer), and the specific impulse is raised somewhat\n(giving improved performance). The oxide can be in the form of liquid droplets\n(in the chamber) or solid particles (in the nozzle diverging section), depending on\nthe local gas temperature. Furthermore, the impact of these particulates with the\nwall will cause an additional increase in heat transfer, particularly to the walls\nin the nozzle throat and immediately upstream of the nozzle throat region. The\nparticles also cause erosion or abrasion of the walls.\n\n8.6. STARTING AND IGNITION\n\nThe starting of a thrust chamber has to be controlled so that a timely and even\nignition of propellants is achieved and the flow and thrust are built up smoothly\nand quickly to their rated value (see Refs. 6-1, 8\u201416, and 8-17). The initial\npropellant flow is always less than full flow, and the starting mixture ratio is\nusually different from the operating mixture ratio. A low initial flow prevents\nstrong water hammer, gives a low initial heat release, and for nonhypergolic\npropellants it prevents an excessive accumulation of unignited liquid propellants\nin the chamber.\n\nThe starting injection velocity is low, the initial vaporization, atomization, and\nmixing of propellants in a cold combustion chamber is often incomplete, and\nthere are local regions of lean and rich mixtures. With cryogenic propellants the\ninitial chamber temperature can be below ambient. The optimum starting mixture\nis therefore only an average of a range of mixture ratios, all of which should\nbe readily ignited. Mixture ratios near the stoichiometric mixture ratio have a\nhigh heat release per unit of propellant mass and therefore permit bringing the\nchamber and the gases up to equilibrium faster than would be possible with other\nmixtures. The operating mixture ratio is usually fuel rich and is usually selected\n",
    "341": "324 THRUST CHAMBERS.\nfor optimum specific impulse. One method of analytical modeling of the ignition\nof cryogenic propellants is given in Ref. 8-16.\n\nThe time delay for starting a thrust chamber ideally consists of the following\ntime periods:\n\n1. Time needed to fully open the propellant valves (typically 0.002 to more\n\nthan 1.00 sec, depending on valve type and its size and upstream pressure).\n\n2. Time needed to fill the liquid passage volume between the valve seat and\nthe injector face (piping, internal injector feed holes, and cavities).\n\n3. Time for forming discrete streams or sprays of liquid propellant (sometimes\ngaseous propellant, if cryogenic liquid is preheated by heat from cooling\njacket) and for initial atomization into small droplets and for mixing these\ndroplets.\n\n4. For today\u2019s hypergolic propellant combinations at ambient initial tempera-\ntures, the combustion starts within a few milliseconds after a fuel droplet\nor fuel vapor comes into contact with an oxidizer droplet or oxidizer vapor.\nThis delay can be longer at low ambient temperatures and at off-mixture\nratios.\n\n5. For nonhypergolic propellant combinations an igniter system has to provide\nsufficient heat to bring a flow of mixed propellant to its ignition tempera-\nture, before combustion can safely start. The igniter is usually started before\nany propellant is admitted to the chamber and usually before the propellant\nvalves are opened. The time for the igniter to operate before any propellant\ncomes in contact with the igniter flame can be one or more seconds in\nlarger thrust chambers. If the igniter fails to operate and if this is sensed,\nthen the engine controls can block the opening of the propellant valves.\n\n6. Time needed for droplets to vaporize and ignite (laboratory tests show this\nto be short, 0.02 to 0.05 sec, but this depends on the propellants and the\navailable heat).\n\n7. Once ignition is achieved at a particular location in the chamber, it takes\ntime to spread the flame or to heat all the mixed propellant that is entering\ninto the chamber, vaporizing it, and raising it to ignition temperature.\n\n8. Time needed to raise the chamber pressure and temperature to the point\nwhere combustion will be self-sustaining. Then it is raised to its full pres-\nsure.\n\nThere are overlaps in these delays and several of them can occur simultaneously.\nThe delays are longer with large injectors or large-diameter chambers. Small\nthrusters can usually be started very quickly, in a few milliseconds, while larger\nunits require 1 sec or more, sometimes as much as 5 sec.\n\nIn starting a thrust chamber, one propellant always reaches the chamber a\nshort time ahead of the other; it is almost impossible to synchronize exactly\nthe fuel and oxidizer feed systems so that the propellants reach the chamber\nsimultaneously at all injection holes or spray elements. Frequently, a more reliable\n",
    "342": "8.6. STARTING AND IGNITION 325\nignition is assured when one of the propellants is intentionally made to reach the\nchamber first. For example, for a fuel-rich starting mixture the fuel is admitted\nfirst. Reference 8\u201417 describes the control of the propellant lead.\n\nOther factors influencing the starting flows, the propellant lead or leg, and\nsome of the delays mentioned above are the liquid pressures supplied to the\ninjector (e.g., regulated pressure), the temperature of the propellant (some can be\nclose to their vapor point), and the amount of insoluble gas (air bubbles) mixed\nwith the initial quantity of propellants.\n\nThe propellant valves (and the flow passages betwen the valves and the injec-\ntor face) are often so designed and controlled that they operate in a definite\nsequence, thereby assuring an intentional lead of one of the propellants and a\ncontrolled buildup of flow and mixture ratio. Often the valves are only partially\nopened because it is easier to ignite a small flow and it avoids an accumulation\nof hazardous unburned propellant mixture in the chamber. Once combustion is\nestablished, the valves are fully opened and full flow may reach the thrust cham-\nber assembly. The initial reduced flow burning period is called the preliminary\nstage. Section 11.4 describes the starting controls.\n\nFull flow in the larger thrust chambers is not initiated with non-self-igniting\npropellants until the controller received a signal of successful ignition. The verifi-\ncation of ignition or initial burning is often built into engine controls using visual\ndetection (photocell), heat detection (pyrometer), a fusible wire link, or sensing\nof a pressure rise. If the starting controls are not designed properly, unburnt\npropellant may accumulate in the chamber; upon ignition it may then explode,\ncausing sometimes severe damage to the rocket engine. Starting controls and\nengine calibrations are discussed in Sections 11.4 and 11.5.\n\nNonspontaneously ignitable propellants need to be activated by absorbing\nenergy prior to combustion initiation. This energy is supplied by the ignition\nsystem. Once ignition has begun the flame is self-supporting. The igniter has to\nbe located near the injector in such a manner that a satisfactory starting mixture\nat low initial flow is present at the time of igniter activation, yet it should not\nhinder or obstruct the steady-state combustion process. At least five different\ntypes of successful propellant ignition systems have been used.\n\nSpark plug ignition has been used successfully on liquid oxygen\u2014gasoline\nand on oxygen\u2014hydrogen thrust chambers, particularly for multiple starts during\nflight. The spark plug is often built into the injector, as shown in Fig. 9-6.\n\nIgnition by electrically heated wires has been accomplished but at times has\nproven to be less reliable than spark ignition for liquid propellants.\n\nPyrotechnic ignition uses a solid propellant squib or grain of a few seconds\u2019\nburning duration. The solid propellant charge is electrically ignited and burns\nwith a hot flame within the combustion chamber. Almost all solid propellant\nrockets and many liquid rocket chambers are ignited in this fashion. The igniter\ncontainer may be designed to fit directly onto the injector or the chamber (see\nFig. 8-1), or may be held in the chamber from outside through the nozzle. This\nignition method can only be used once; thereafter the charge has to be replaced.\n",
    "343": "326 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nIgnition has been achieved in a precombustion chamber also called premix\nchamber; see Fig. 8-3; it is a small chamber built next to the main combustion\nchamber and connected through an orifice; this is similar to the precombustion\nchamber used in some internal combustion engines. A small amount of fuel and\noxidizer is injected into the precombustion chamber and ignited. The burning\nmixture enters the main combustion chamber in a torchlike fashion and ignites\nthe larger main propellant flow which is injected directly into the main chamber.\nThis ignition procedure permits repeated starting of thrust chambers and has\nproved successful with the liquid oxygen-gasoline and oxygen\u2014hydrogen thrust\nchambers.\n\nAuxiliary fluid ignition is a method whereby some hypergolic liquid or gas, in\naddition to the regular fuel and oxidizer, is injected into the combustion chamber\nfor a very short period during the starting operation. This fluid is hypergolic,\nwhich means it produces spontaneous combustion with either the fuel or the oxi-\ndizer. The combustion of nitric acid and some organic fuels can, for instance,\nbe initiated by the introduction of a small quantity of hydrazine or aniline at the\nbeginning of the rocket operation. Liquids that ignite with air (zinc diethyl] or alu-\nminum triethyl), when preloaded in the fuel piping, can accomplish a hypergolic\nignition. The flow diagram of the RD 170 Russian rocket engine in Fig. 11-2\nshows several cylindrical containers prefilled with a hypergolic liquid, one for\neach of the high-pressure fuel supply lines; this hypergolic liquid is pushed out\n(by the initial fuel) into the thrust chambers and into the preburners to start their\nignitions.\n\nIn vehicles with multiple engines or thrust chambers it is required to start two\nor more together. It is often difficult to get exactly simultaneous starts. Usually\nthe passage or manifold volumes of each thrust chamber and their respective\nvalues are designed to be the same. The temperature of the initial propellant\nfed to each thrust chamber and the lead time of the first quantity of propellant\nentering into the chambers have to be controlled. This is needed, for example,\nin two small thrusters when used to apply roll torques to a vehicle. It is also\none of the reasons why large space launch vehicles are not released from their\nlaunch facility until there is assurance that all the thrust chambers are started and\noperating.\n\n8.7. RANDOM VARIABLE THRUST\n\nOnly some applications require a randomly variable thrust from an engine.\nExamples are descend on a planet or the moon, combat aircraft or upper stage\nof an anti-ballistic missile. One of the advantages of liquid propellant rocket\nengines is that they can be designed to throttle or randomly vary its thrust over\na wide range during flight. There have been several approaches to achieve vari-\nable or randomly reduced thrust. Essentially all the approaches to vary the thrust\ninvolve the thrust chamber and therefore this section has been placed into the\nthrust chamber chapter. One of the early schemes was to use multiple engines or\n",
    "344": "8.7. RANDOM VARIABLE THRUST 327\nmultiple thrust chambers on the same engine and then stop the operation of one\nor more of them. The Reaction Motors 6,000C-4 engine had four thrust chambers\nand they could be turned on or off individually; this gave a step change in thrust.\n\nToday one can distinguish between two modes of operation and both depend\non reducing the propellant flow. The first is moderate throttling, typically over\na thrust range of two or three, and this can usually be accomplished without\nsignificant design changes to the engine. In one application the thrust is throttled\nduring the ascent of a booster vehicle in order to prevent excessive aerodynamic\nheating. The other mode, often called deep throttling , varies the thrust by a factor\nof between 6 to 30 for specific engines. It applies, for example, to a planetary\nlanding rocket engine with controlled deceleration. To achieve this deep throttling,\nthe engine requires some special features and some of these are mentioned below.\n\nThe thrust is almost proportional to the propellant mass flow (Eq. 2-14) and\ntherefore reducing that flow will reduce the thrust. With moderate throttling it\ncan be achieved by simultaneously closing the main fuel valve and the main\noxidizer valve (with matching flow characteristics) or alternatively by slowing\ndown the rotary speed of the turbopumps (by reducing the gas flow to the turbine)\nwith a hydraulically matched fuel pump and oxidizer pump. At lower flow the\npressure drop across the injector and the injection velocity will be diminished,\nthe atomization and mixing of the propellants will be somewhat less efficient and\nthe combustion will be less complete, and the chamber pressure will be reduced.\nThis usually causes a decrease in the specific impulse at the lower thrust levels\nof perhaps 1.5 to 9%, depending on the specific engine design. This method\nof varying the thrust is used in a number of booster engines for space launch\nvehicles.\n\nWith deeper throttling the oxidizer and fuel flows tend to oscillate and will\nusually no longer be at the original mixture ratio, the propellant injection streams\nor sprays and their impingement locations will wander, and the flow is likely to\nbecome erratic. To prevent these phenomena the engines have some special fea-\ntures as illustrated by the lunar landing rocket engine; this engine was throttled\nby a factor of up to 10:1, was developed by the predecessor of Northrop Grum-\nman, and flew in the late 1960s and 1970s. Its propellant flow control valves\neach included a cavitating venturi with a movable tapered pintle that allowed to\nvary the flow area of the venturi throat of the thrust chamber valve. This assured\na predetermined steady reduced flow of propellants at all thrust levels, and main-\ntained the mixture ratio to be the same as the full thrust value. Furthermore the\ninjection of the propellants was through a pintle injector with two annular slots\nof a moving sleeve and the width of these slots could be reduced by an actuator\nbuilt into the injector. The lower right sketch of Fig. 8-3 shows this feature. It\nallows high injection velocities of the liquid propellants, giving good atomization\nand pretty good combustion and a relatively small loss in performance at low\nthrust. The highest thrust variation of 357 to 1.0 was with the sustainer engines of\nthe Lance surface-to-surface missile. Its engine, developed by Rocketdyne (today\nPratt & Whitney Rocketdyne), first flew in the late 1960s. The specific impulse\nat low thrust was poor (more than 15% loss).\n",
    "345": "328 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nAnother approach to achieve variable thrust is to also vary the nozzle throat\narea. See Eq. 3-31. This scheme requires a moveable tapered pintle in the main\nnozzle throat area. The pintle has to be made of heat-tolerant material or has to be\nregeneratively cooled and the pintle position is usually hydraulically controlled.\nThis will allow to maintain essentially constant chamber pressure at all thrust\nlevels. Several experimental liquid propellant engines and also solid propellant\nmotors with a random variable nozzle throat area have been built and tested. To\nthe best of the author\u2019s knowledge, none have flown.\n\nFor small reaction control thrusters the average thrust is usually reduced\nby pulsing. It is accomplished by controlling the number of cycles or pulses\n(each has one short fixed-duration thrust pulse plus a short fixed-duration zero-\nthrust pause), by modulating the duration of individual pulses (with short pauses\nbetween pulses), or alternatively by lengthening the pause between pulses.\n\n8.8. SAMPLE THRUST CHAMBER DESIGN ANALYSIS\n\nThis example shows how a thrust chamber is strongly influenced by the overall\nvehicle system requirements or the mission parameters and the vehicle design.\nAs outlined in the design section of Chapter 11 and in the discussion of the\nselection of propulsion systems in Chapter 19, each engine goes through a series\nof rationalizations and requirements that define its key parameters and its design.\nIn this example we describe one way of how the thrust chamber parameters are\nderived from the vehicle and engine requirements. The overall system require-\nments relate to the mission, its purpose, environment, trajectories, reusability,\nreliability, and to restraints such as allowable engine mass, or maximum dimen-\nsional envelope. We are listing some, but not all of the requirements. It shows\nhow theory is blended with experience to arrive at the initial choices of the design\nparameters. This example could be different, if it would be done by a different\ndesign team.\n\nExample 8-2. Here we define the application as a new upper stage of an existing\nmultistage space launch vehicle that will propel a payload into deep space. This means\ncontinuous firing (no restart or reuse), operating in the vacuum of space (high nozzle area\nratio), modest acceleration (not to exceed 5 go), reasonably low cost, moderately high\nperformance (specific impulse), and a thrust whose magnitude depends on the payloads,\nthe flight path, and acceleration limits. The desired mission velocity increase of the stage\nis 3400 m/sec. The engine is attached to its own stage, which is subsequently disconnected\nand dropped from the payload stage. The payload stage (3500 kg) consists of a payload of\n1500 kg (for scientific instruments, power supply, or communications and flight control\nequipment) and its own propulsion systems (including propellant) of 2000 kg (for trajec-\ntory changes, station keeping, attitude control, or emergency maneuvers). There are two\ngeometric restraints: The vehicle has an outside diameter of 2.0 m, but when the structure,\nconduits, certain equipment, thermal insulation, fittings, and assembly are considered, it\n",

We can summarize the key requirements:\n\nApplication Uppermost stage to an existing\n\nmultistage launch vehicle\n\nPayload 3500 kg\n\nDesired velocity increase Au 3400 m/sec in gravity-free vacuum\n\nMaximum stage diameter 1.90 m\n\nMaximum stage length 4.50 m\n\nMaximum acceleration 5 g0\nDecisions on Basic Parameters. The following engine design decisions or\nparameter selection should be made early in the design process:\nPropellant combination\nChamber pressure\nNozzle area ratio\nFeed system, using pumps or pressurized tanks\nThrust level\n\nFrom a performance point of view, the best propellant combination would\n\nbe liquid oxygen with liquid hydrogen. However, this bipropellant would have\na low average specific gravity (0.36). There is not enough volume in this upper\nstage to allow sufficient propellant mass for attaining the desired vehicle velocity\nincrement Au. The lower stages of the existing launch vehicle use liquid oxygen\nwith RP-1 fuel with an average specific gravity of about 1.014, and the launch\npad is already equipped for supplying these. The new stage is limited in volume\nand cross section. Because of these factors the propellant combination of liquid\noxygen and RP-1 (a type of kerosene) is selected. From Fig. 5-1 we see that\nthe theoretical specific impulse is between 280 and 300 sec, depending on the\nmixture ratio and whether we use frozen or shifting chemical equilibrium in\nthe nozzle flow expansion. This figure also shows that the maximum value of\nthe characteristic velocity c* is reached at a mixture ratio of about 2.30, which\nis a fuel-rich mixture. We select this mixture ratio. Its combustion temperature\nis lower than the mixture ratios with higher values, and this should make the\ncooling of the thrust chamber easier. We will see later that cooling may present\nsome problems. Based on universal experience, we select a value of J, part way\n(about 40%) between the values for frozen and shifting equilibrium, namely 292\nsec at the standard chamber pressure of 1000 psi or 6.895 MPa, and a nozzle big\nenough for expansion to sea level. From Fig. S\u20141 and Table 5\u20145 we find the\nmolecular mass to be 23 kg/kg-mol and the specific heat ratio k to be about 1.24.\nLater we will correct this value of J, from this standard reference condition to\nthe actual vacuum specific impulse of the thrust chamber with its actual nozzle\nexit area ratio.\n",
    "347": "330 THRUST CHAMBERS.\n\nNext we will select a chamber pressure, a nozzle area ratio, and a feed system\nconcept. Historically there has been favorable experience with this propellant\ncombination at chamber pressures between 100 and 3400 psia with nozzle area\nratios up to about 40 with both gas generator cycles and staged combustion\ncycles, giving proof that this is feasible. The following considerations enter into\nthis selection:\n\n1. Higher chamber pressures allow a smaller thrust chamber and (for the\nsame nozzle exit pressure) a shorter nozzle cone with a smaller nozzle exit\ndiameter. The thrust chamber is small enough for a toroidal tank to be built\naround it, and this conserves stage length. This not only saves vehicle space\nbut usually also some inert mass in the vehicle and the engine. Figure 8\u201422\nshows the relative sizes of thrust chambers for three chamber pressures\nand two nozzle area ratios (\u20ac of 100 and 300). The nozzle length and exit\ndiameter cannot exceed the values given in the requirements, which, as can\nbe seen, rules out low chamber pressure or a large nozzle. The dimensions\nshown are calculated later in this analysis.\n\n2. The heat transfer rate, which varies with the gas-film coefficient, is almost\nproportional to the gas density, which is nearly proportional to the chamber\npressure, as shown by Eq. 8-20 or 8-22. On some prior thrust cham-\nbers there have been problems with the formation of solid carbon layer or\ndeposits either inside the cooling jacket (increasing wall temperatures) or\non the inner walls of the combustion chamber (the solid can flake off and\ncause burnout). This favors a lower chamber pressure.\n\nPp, = 8.962 MPa P; = 4.826 MPa Pp; = 0.689 MPa\n(1300 psia) (700 psia) (100 psia)\n1.4m\n1.7m 1.69m\n| +\u2014 254m 4 | |\n+ | - f 3.32 m\nDyoo = 0.60 m 4\nPsoo = 1.05 m Digg = 0.835 m |\nDayo = 1.44 m ca\n71m Dyoo = 2.21 m\n| Dao = 3.79 m\nFIGURE 8-22.

    "348": "8.8. SAMPLE THRUST CHAMBER DESIGN ANALYSIS 331\n\n3. Concern over leak-free seals for both static and dynamic seals increases\nwith chamber pressure, which in turn causes all feed pressures also to\nincrease.\n\n4. A feed system using pressurized gas is feasible, but its inert masses of tanks\nand engine are favorable only if the chamber pressure is very low, perhaps\naround 100 psia or less. The tanks for propellants and pressurizing gas\nbecome very heavy and the thrust chamber will be very large and exceed\nthe dimensional restraints mentioned above. We therefore cannot use this\nfeed system or very low chamber pressures.\n\n5. If we use a pump feed system, the power needed to drive the pumps\nincreases directly with chamber pressure p;. In a gas generator engine\ncycle this means a slightly reduced performance as the value of p; goes\nup. For a staged combustion cycle it means high pressures, particularly\nhigh-pressure hot gas flexible piping, and a more complex, heavier, and\nexpensive engine. We therefore select a gas generator cycle (see Fig. 1\u20144)\nat a low enough chamber pressure so that the thrust chamber (and the other\ninert hardware) will just fit the geometrical constraints, and the engine inert\nmass and the heat transfer will be reasonable.\n\nFor these reasons we pick a chamber pressure of 700 psia or 4.825 MPa and an\narea ratio of 100. With further analysis we could have picked p; more precisely;\nit could be slightly lower. Next we correct the specific impulse to the operating\nconditions using a ratio of thrust coefficients. We can use Eq. 3-30 or interpolate\nbetween Figs. 3-7 and 3-8 for a value of k = 1.24. The reference or standard\ncondition (see Fig. 3\u20146) is for a pressure ratio p;/p3 of 1000/14.7 = 68, which\ncorresponds to an area ratio of about 8. Then (Cr) standard = 1.58. For the actual\nhigh-altitude operation the pressure ratio is close to infinity. The nozzle has an\narea ratio of 100; we can determine the thrust coefficient by interpolating with\npressure at k = 1.24. The result is (Cr) yacuum = 1.90. The new ideal specific\nimpulse value for a chamber threshold of 700 psia and a nozzle area ratio of\n100 is therefore 292 x (1.90/1.58) = 351.1 sec. In order to correct for losses\n(divergence, boundary layer, incomplete combustion, some film cooling, etc.)\nwe use a correction factor of 0.96 giving a thrust chamber specific impulse of\n337.1 sec. The engine uses a gas generator and this will reduce the engine specific\nimpulse further by a factor of approximately 0.98 or (Js engine = 330.3 sec or an\neffective exhaust velocity of 3237 m/sec.\n\nStage Masses and Thrust Level. An estimate of the stage masses will next\nbe made. We assume that the inert hardware (tanks, gas, generator, turbopumps,\netc.) is about 7% of the propellant mass, which is conservative when compared\nto existing engines. In a full-fledged engine design this number would be verified\nor corrected once an estimated but more detailed mass budget becomes available.\nFrom Eq. 4-7\n\nedujy _ Mo _ mp + 0.07m, + 3500 = 9340/3237\nmy 0.07mp + 3500\n",

It is Fimax = moa = 11,510 x 5 x 9.8 = 564,400 N. This would become\na relatively large and heavy thrust chamber. Considerable saving in inert mass\ncan be obtained if a smaller thrust size (but longer firing duration) is chosen.\nSince this same thrust chamber is going to be used for another mission where an\nacceleration of somewhat less than 1.0 go is wanted, a thrust level of 50,000 N or\n11,240 Ibf is chosen.

The internal diameter of the\nnozzle at exit A> is determined from the area ratio of 100 to be Dy = /100 x D,\nor 83.26 cm. A shortened or truncated bell nozzle (as discussed in Section 3.4)\nwill be used with 80% of the length of a 15\u00b0 conical nozzle, but with the same\nperformance as a 15\u00b0 cone.

For an 80% shortened bell nozzle this\nlength would be about 111.8 cm. The contour or shape of a shortened bell nozzle\ncan be approximated by a parabola (parabola equation is y? = 2px). Using an\nanalysis (similar to the analysis that resulted in Fig. 3-14), the maximum angle\nof the diverging section at the inflection point would be about 6; = 34\u00b0 and the\nnozzle exit angle 9, = 7\u00b0. The approximate contour consists of a short segment\nof radius 0.4r, of a 34\u00b0 included angle (between points T and J in Fig. 3-14) and\na parabola with two known points at J and E.

Before detail design\nis undertaken, a more accurate contour, using the method of characteristics, is\nsuggested.\n\nThe chamber diameter should be about twice the nozzle throat diameter to\navoid pressure losses in the combustion chamber (D, = 16.64 cm). Using the\napproximate length of prior successful smaller chambers and a characteristic\nlength L* of about 1.1 m, the chamber length (together with the converging nozzle\nsection) is about 11.8 in. or 29.9 cm. The overall length of the thrust chamber\n(169 cm) is the sum of the nozzle length (111.8 cm), chamber (29.9 cm), injector\nthickness (estimated at 8 cm), mounted valves (estimated at 10 cm), a support\nstructure, and possibly also a gimbal joint.

First we determine how much of this volume is occupied\nby propellant tanks and how much might be left over or be available for the\n",

This analysis would normally be done by tank design specialists.\nThe average density of the propellant mixture can be determined from Eq. 7-1\nto be 1014 kg/m? and the total usable propellant of 7478 kg. Using densities\nfrom Table 7\u20141 the fuel volume and the oxidizer volume can be calculated to be\n2.797 and 4.571 m\u00b0, respectively. For a diameter of 1.90 m, a nearly spherical\nfuel tank, a separate oxidizer cylindrical tank with elliptical ends, 6% ullage, and\n2% residual propellant, a layout would show an overall tank length of about 3.6\nm in a space that is limited to 4.50 m. This would leave only 0.9 m for the length\nof the thrust chamber, and this is not long enough. Therefore we would need to\nresort to a more compact tank arrangement, such as using a common bulkhead\nbetween the two tanks or building a toroidal tank around the engine. It is not\nthe aim to design the tanks in this example, but the conclusion affects the thrust\nchamber. Since the available volume of the vehicle is limited, it is not a good\nidea to try to make the thrust chamber bigger.\n\nThis diversion into the tank design shows how a vehicle parameter affects\n\nthe thrust chamber design. For example, if the tank design would turn out to be\ndifficult or the tanks would become too heavy, then one of these thrust chamber\noptions can be considered: (1) go to a higher chamber pressure (makes the thrust\nchamber and nozzle smaller, but heavier), (2) go to a lower thrust engine (will\nbe smaller and lighter), (3) store the nozzle of the upper-stage thrust chamber in\ntwo pieces and assemble them during the flight once the lower stages have been\nused and discarded (see extendible nozzle in Fig. 8\u201417; it is more complex and\nsomewhat heavier), or (4) use more than one thrust chamber in the engine (will\nbe heavier, but shorter and can provide roll control). We will not pursue these or\nother options here.\nHeat Transfer. The particular computer program for estimating heat transfer\nand cooling parameters of thrust chambers will depend on the background and\nexperience of specific engineers and rocket organizations. Typical computer pro-\ngrams divide the internal wall surface of the chamber and nozzle into incremental\naxial steps. Usually in a preliminary analysis the heat transfer is estimated only\nfor critical locations such as for the throat and perhaps the chamber.\n\nFrom Fig. 5\u20141 and Eq. 3\u201412 or 3\u201422 we determine the following gas temper-\natures for the chamber, nozzle throat region, and a location in the diverging exit\nsection. They are: T; = 3600 K, 7; = 3214 K, and T, = 1430 K at an area ratio\nof 6.0 in the diverging nozzle section. The chamber and nozzle down to an exit\narea ratio of 6 will have to be cooled by fuel. For this propellant combination and\nfor the elevated wall temperatures a stainless steel has been successfully used for\nthe inner wall material.\n\nNotice that beyond this area ratio of about 6, the nozzle free-stream gas tem-\nperatures are relatively low. Uncooled high-temperature metals can be used here\nin this outer nozzle region. Radiation cooling, using a material such as niobium\n(coated to prevent excessive oxidation) or carbon fibers in a nonporous carbon\nmatrix, is suitable between an area ratio of 6 and about 25. For the final large\nnozzle exit section, where the temperatures are even lower, a lower cost material\n",
    "352": "8.8. SAMPLE THRUST CHAMBER DESIGN ANALYSIS 335\nsuch as stainless steel or titanium is suggested. Ablative materials have been ruled\nout because of the long duration and the aggressive ingredients in the exhaust\ngas. The gas compositions of Figs. 5\u20142 and 5\u20143 indicate that some free oxygen\nand hydroxyl are present.\n\nWe now have identified the likely materials for key chamber components. The\nbest way to cool the radiation-cooled exit segment of the nozzle (beyond area\nratio of 6) is to let it stick out of the vehicle structure; the heat can then be freely\nradiated to space. One way to accomplish this is to discard the vehicle structure\naround the nozzle end after stage separation and before second-stage start.\n\nAs in Fig. 8-8, the maximum heat transfer rate will be at the nozzle throat\nregion. A variety of heat transfer analysis programs are available for estimat-\ning this heat transfer. If a suitable computer program is not available, then an\napproximate steady-state heat transfer analysis can be made using Eqs. 8-14 to\n8-18 and the physical properties (specific heat, thermal conductivity, and den-\nsity) of RP-1 at elevated temperatures. The film coefficients of Eqs. 8-22 and\n8-24 are also needed. This is not done in this example, in part because data\ntables for the physical properties would take up a lot of space and results are\nnot always reliable. Data from prior thrust chambers with the same propellants\nindicate a heat transfer rate at the nozzle throat region exceeding 10 Btu/in.?-sec\nor 1.63 x 107 W/m?.\n\nThe RP-1 fuel is an unusual coolant since it does not have a distinct boiling\npoint. Its composition is not consistent and depends on the oil stock from which\nit was refined and the refining process. It is distilled or evaporated gradually\nover a range of temperatures. The very hot wall can cause the RP-1 to locally\nbreak down into carbon-rich material and to partially evaporate or gasify. As\nlong as the small vapor bubbles are recondensed when they are mixed with the\ncooler portions of the coolant flow, a steady heat transfer process will occur. If\nthe heat transfer is high enough, then these bubbles will not be condensed, may\ncontain noncondensable gases, and the flow will contain substantial gas bubbles\nand become unsteady, causing local overheating. The recondensing is aided by\nhigh cooling passage velocities (more than 10 m/sec at the throat region) and by\nturbulence in these passages. A coolant flow velocity of 15 m/sec is selected for\nthe nozzle throat region (adequate to prevent big gas bubbles), 7 m/sec for the\nchamber region and somewhat less, 3 m/sec for the cooled nozzle exit segment.\n\nThe material for the cooling jacket will be stainless steel to resist the oxidation\nand erosion of the fast moving, aggressive hot gas, which contains a small amount\nof free oxygen and hydroxyl species. The forced cooling by fuel will assure that\nthe temperatures of this stainless steel are well below its softening temperature\nof about 1050 K.\n\nThe construction of the cooling jacket can be tubular, as shown in Figs. 8-1\nand 8-9, or it can consist of milled channels as shown in Figs. 8\u20142 and 8-15.\nThe cross section of each tube or cooling channel will be a minimum at the throat\nregion, gradually become larger, and be about two or more times as large at the\nchamber and diverging nozzle regions. The wall thickness (on the hot gas side)\nshould be as small as possible to reduce the temperature drop across the wall\n",

Figure 8\u201411 shows this behavior, but for a thick wall. Practical\nconsiderations such as manufacturability, the number of test firings before flight,\nthe deformation under pressure loads, the temperature gradient and dimensional\ntolerances also enter into the selection of the wall thickness. A inner wall thick-\nness of 0.5 mm and a cooling velocity of 15 m/sec have been selected for the\nthroat region of the cooling jacket. Milled slots (rather than tubes) have been\nselected for this thrust chamber.\n\nThe selection of the number of milled slots, their cross sections, and the wall\nthickness is a function of the coolant mass flow, its pressure, wall stresses, wall\nmaterial, and the shape of the channel. Figure 8\u201423 and Table 8\u20146 describe\nthe channel width and height for different numbers of channels and different\nlocations. The fuel coolant flow is diminished by the gas generator fuel flow\n(0.293 kg/sec) and is about 4.387 kg/sec. For this flow and a cooling velocity\nof 15 m/sec in the throat region the cumulative cross-sectional area of all the\nchannels is only about 3.62 cm*. The cooling velocity is lower in the chamber\nand nozzle regions and the cumulative channel flow area will be larger there.\nThe variables are the number of channels, the thickness of the hot wall, the rib\nthickness between channels, the cooling velocity, the gas temperature, and the\nlocation along the thrust chamber profile. The number of channels or tubes will\ndetermine the shape of the cross section, ranging from deep and thin to almost\nsquare. The effect of varying the number of channels or channel dimensions and\nshape is shown in Table 8\u20146. The minimum inert mass of the cooling jacket and\na low friction loss occur, when the shape (which varies axially throughout the\njacket) is on the average close to a square. On the basis of analyses, as shown\nin the table, a 150-channel design has been selected for giving favorable cross\nsection, reasonable dimensions for ease of fabrication, good cooling, and often\nlow thermal wall stresses.\n\nReinforcing bands have to be put on the outside of the tubes or channels to\nhold the internal gas pressure during operation, to contain the coolant pressures,\nwhich cause heated walls wanting to become round, and any surge pressures\nduring the start transient or arising from water hammer in the lines.

For this propellant combination we have used both doublets\n(like and unlike), and triplets in the United States, and the Russians have used\nmultiple hollow double posts with swirling or rotation of the flow in the outer\nannulus. Based on good experience and demonstrated combustion stability with\nsimilar designs, we select a doublet self-impinging-type stream pattern (Fig. 8\u20143)\nand an injector structure design similar to Fig 8\u20145. The impinging streams form\nfans of liquid propellant, which break up into droplets. Oxidizer and fuel fans\nalternate radially. We could also use a platelet design, like Fig. 8-6.\n\nThe pressure drop across the injector is usually set at values between 15 and\n25% of the chamber pressure, in part to obtain high injection velocities, which\naid in atomization and droplet breakup.

The equation is solved for the area A, which is the\ncumulative cross-section area of all the injection holes of one of the propellants\nin the injector face.\n\nWith rounded and clean injection hole entrances the discharge coefficient will\n\nbe about 0.80 as shown in Table 8\u20142. Solving for the cumulative injection hole\narea for the fuel and the oxidizer flows gives 1.98 cm? for the fuel and 4.098 cm?\nfor the oxidizer. A typical hole diameter in this size of injector would be about\n0.5 to 2.5 mm. We will use a hole size of 1.5 mm for the fuel holes (with\n90% of the fuel flow) and 2.00 mm for the oxidizer hole size, resulting in 65\ndoublets of oxidizer holes and 50 doublets of fuel. By using a slightly smaller fuel\ninjection hole diameter, we can match the number of 65 doublets as used with\nthe oxidizer holes. These injection doublets will be arranged on the injector face\nin concentric patterns similar to Fig. 8-5. We may be able to obtain a slightly\nhigher performance by going to smaller hole sizes and a large number of fuel\nand oxidizer holes. In addition there will be extra fuel holes on the periphery\nof the injector face to help in providing the cooler boundary layer, which is\nneeded to reduce heat transfer. They will use 10% of the fuel flow and, for a\n0.5-mm hole diameter, the number of holes will be about 100. To make a good\nset of liquid fans, equal inclination angles of about 25\u00b0 are used with the doublet\nimpingements. See Fig. 8-7.\nIgniter Dimensions. A pyrotechnic (solid propellant) igniter will be used. It\nhas to have enough energy and run long enough to provide the pressure and\ntemperature in the thrust chamber for good ignition. Its largest diameter has to\nbe small enough to be inserted through the throat, namely 8.0 cm maximum\ndiameter and it can be 10 to 15 cm long. The actual igniter will, most likely, be\nsmaller than this.\n",

We now have\nenough of the key design parameters of the selected thrust chamber, so a pre-\nliminary layout drawing can be made. Before this can be done well, we will\nneed some analysis or estimates on the thrust chamber manifolds for fuel and\noxidizer, valve mounting provisions and their locations, a nozzle closure during\nstorage, a thrust structure, and possibly an actuator and gimbal mount, if gim-\nbaling is required by the mission. A detailed layout or CAD (computer-aided\ndesign) image (not shown in this analysis) would allow a more accurate picture\nand a good determination of the mass of the thrust chamber and its center of\ngravity both with and without propellants.\n\nEstimates of gas pressures, liquid pressures (or pressure drops) in the flow\npassages, injector, cooling jacket, and the valves are needed for the stress anal-\nysis, so that various wall thicknesses and component masses can be determined.\nMaterial properties will need to be obtained from references or tests. A few of\nthese analyses and designs may actually change some of the data we selected or\nestimated early in this sample analysis, and some of the calculated parameters\nmay have to be re-analyzed and revised. Further changes in the thrust chamber\ndesign may become evident in the design of the engine, the tanks, or the inter-\nface with the vehicle. The methods, processes, and fixtures for manufacturing\nand testing (and the number and types of tests) will have to be evaluated and the\nnumber of thrust chambers to be built has to be decided before we can arrive at\na reasonable manufacturing plan, a schedule, and cost estimates.\n\nPROBLEMS\n1.

    "363": "CHAPTER 9\nSS\nLIQUID PROPELLANT COMBUSTION\nAND ITS STABILITY\n\nIn this chapter we treat the complex phenomena of the combustion processes in\nthe combustion chamber of a liquid bipropellant thrust chamber. We describe\nin general terms the combustion behavior, the progress in analysis of combus-\ntion, the several types of combustion instability with its undesirable effects, and\nsemiempirical remedies which avoid these. The objective is to operate at very\nhigh combustion efficiencies and to prevent 100% of all the occurrence of disrup-\ntive or destructive combustion instability. Thrust chambers should operate with\nstable combustion over their full range of operating conditions. For a treatment\nof these subjects see Refs. 9-1 to 9-7.\n\nThe combustion of liquid propellants is very efficient in well-designed thrust\nchambers, precombustion chambers, or gas generators. Efficiencies of 95 to\n99.5% are typical compared to turbojets or furnaces, which can range from\n50 to 97%. This is due to the very high reaction rates at the high combustion\ntemperatures and the thorough mixing of fuel and oxidizer reaction species by\nmeans of good injection flow distribution and gas turbulence. The losses are\nlargely due to incomplete burning or inadequate mixing (nonuniform mixing\nratio). For very small bipropellant thrust chambers or small gas generators,\nwhere the injector has very few injection orifices or elements, the combustion\nefficiency can be well below 95%.\n\n9.1. COMBUSTION PROCESS\n\nIn describing the combustion processes, it is convenient and helpful to the\nunderstanding to divide the combustion chamber into a series of discrete zones,\nas shown in Fig. 9-1 for a typical configuration.

The relative\nthicknesses of these zones in the axial direction, their behavior, and their\ntransitions are influenced by the specific propellant combination, the operating\nconditions (pressure, mixture ratio, etc.), the design of the injector, and chamber\ngeometry. The boundaries between the zones shown in Fig. 9\u20141 are really not flat\nsurfaces and do not display steady flow. They are undulating, dynamically mov-\nable, irregular boundaries with localized changes in velocity, temporary bulges,\nlocally intense radiation emissions, or variable temperature. Table 9-1 shows\nthe major interacting physical and chemical processes that occur in the chamber.\nThis table is a modification of tables and data in Refs. 9-2, 9-3, and 9-7.\n\nThe combustion behavior is propellant dependent. If the cryogenic fuel hydro-\ngen has been used to cool the thrust chamber, the hydrogen would be gaseous\nand fairly warm (60 to 240 K); there would be no liquid hydrogen droplets and\nno evaporation. With hypergolic propellants there is an initial chemical reaction\nin the liquid phase when a droplet of fuel impinges on a droplet of oxidizer.\nExperiments show that the contact can create local explosions and enough\nenergy release to suddenly vaporize a thin layer of the fuel and the oxidizer\nlocally at the droplet\u2019s contact face; there immediately follows a vapor chemical\nreaction and a blow-apart and breakup of the droplets. Occasionally there are\nsmall local explosions and shock wave phenomena (Refs. 9\u20148 and 9-9).\n\nThe combustion process is usually analyzed as a steady-flow process, but in\nreality it is not so. When observing any one location within the chamber, one\nfinds a turbulent flow with local fluctuations with time in pressure, flow, tem-\nperature, density, mixture ratio, or radiation emissions. The boundaries between\nzones identified in Fig. 9-1 or Table 9\u20141 are not in a single plane, do not have\nsteady flow, are more like an undulating changing surface, which locally moves\n",

    "366": "9.1. COMBUSTION PROCESS 349\n\nThe further breakdown of the propellant chemicals into intermediate fractions\nand smaller, simpler chemicals and the oxidation of fuel fractions occur rapidly\nin this zone. The rate of heat release increases greatly, and this causes the specific\nvolume of the gas mixture to increase and the local axial velocity to increase by\na factor of 100 or more. The rapid expansion of the heated gases also forces a\nseries of small local transverse gas flows (cross flow) and even some localized\ntemporary back flow from hot high-burning-rate sites to colder low-burning-\nrate sites. The liquid droplets that may still persist in the upstream portion of\nthis zone, do not follow the gas flow quickly, and are difficult to move in a\ntransverse direction. Therefore, zones of fuel-rich or oxidizer-rich gases will\npersist according to the orifice spray pattern in the upstream injection zone.\nThe gas composition and mixture ratio across the chamber section become more\nuniform as the gases move through this zone, but the mixture never becomes\ntruly uniform. As the reaction product gases are accelerated, they become hotter\n(due to further heat releases) and the lateral velocities remain relatively small\ncompared to the increasing axial velocities. Our understanding of the process is\naided by high-speed photography See Ref. 9-7.\n\nInjection/Atomization Zone\n\nTwo different liquids are injected, both with storable bipropellants and/or liquid\noxygen\u2014hydrocarbon combinations. They are injected through orifices or slots at\nvelocities typically between 7 and 60 m/sec or about 20 to 200 ft/sec. The injector\ndesign has a profound influence on the combustion behavior and some seemingly\nminor design changes can have a major effect on instability. The pattern, sizes,\nnumber, distribution, and types of orifices influence the combustion behavior, as\ndo the pressure drop, manifold geometry, or surface roughness in the injection\norifice walls. The individual jets, streams, or sheets break up into droplets by\nimpingement of one jet with another (or with a surface), by impingement of\nconical spray sheets, by the inherent instabilities of liquid jets or sprays, or by\nthe interaction with gases at a different velocity and temperature. In this first\nzone the liquids are atomized into a large number of small droplets (see Refs.\n9-3, 9-6, 9-7, 9-9, and 9-10). Heat is transferred to the droplets by radiation\nfrom the very hot rapid combustion zone and by convection from moderately hot\ngases in the first zone. The droplets evaporate and create local regions rich either\nin fuel vapor or oxidizer vapor.\n\nThis first zone is heterogeneous; it contains liquids and vaporized propellant\nas well as some burning hot gases. With the liquid being located at discrete sites,\nthere are large gradients in all directions with respect to fuel and oxidizer mass\nfluxes, mixture ratio, size and dispersion of droplets, or properties of the gaseous\nmedium. Chemical reactions begin to occur in this zone, but the rate of heat\ngeneration is relatively low, in part because the liquids and the gases are still\nrelatively cold and in part because vaporization near the droplets causes fuel-rich\nand fuel-lean regions which do not burn as quickly. Some hot gases from the\ncombustion zone are recirculated back from the rapid combustion zone, and they\n",

The hot gases,\nwhich can flow in unsteady vortexes or turbulence patterns, are essential to the\ninitial evaporation of the liquids.\n\nThe injection, atomization, and vaporization processes are different if one of\nthe propellants is a gas. For example, this occurs in liquid oxygen with gaseous\nhydrogen propellant in thrust chambers or precombustion chambers, where\nliquid hydrogen has absorbed heat from cooling jackets and has been gasified.\nHydrogen gas has no droplets and does not evaporate. The gas usually has a\nmuch higher injection velocity (above 120 m/sec) than the liquid propellant.\nThis causes shear forces to be imposed on the liquid jets, with more rapid\ndroplet formation and gasification. The preferred injector design for gaseous\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen is different from the individual jet streams used\nwith storable propellants, as shown in Chapter 8.\n\nStream Tube Combustion Zone\n\nIn this zone oxidation reactions continue, but at a lower rate, and some addi-\ntional heat is released. However, chemical reactions continue because the mixture\ntends to be driven toward an equilibrium composition. Axial velocities are high\n(200 to 600 m/sec), and the transverse convective flow velocities are relatively\nsmall. Streamlines are formed and there is relatively little turbulent mixing across\nstreamline boundaries. Locally the flow velocity and the pressure fluctuate some-\nwhat. The residence time in this zone is very short compared to the residence\ntime in the other two zones. The streamline type, inviscid flow, and the chemical\nreactions toward achieving chemical equilibrium presist not only throughout the\nremainder of the combustion chamber, but are also extended into the nozzle.\n\nThe residence time of the propellant material in the combustion chamber is\nvery short, usually less than 10 msec. Combustion in a liquid rocket engine is very\ndynamic, with the volumetric heat release being approximately 370 MJ/m?-sec,\nwhich is much higher than in turbojets. Further, the higher temperature in a rocket\ncauses chemical reaction rates to be several times faster (increasing exponentially\nwith temperature) than in turbojet.\n\n9.2. ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION\n\nFor the purpose of analyzing the combustion process and its instabilities, it\nhas been convenient to divide the acoustical characteristics into linear and\nnonlinear behavior. A number of computer simulations with linear analyses\nhave been developed over the last 45 years and have been used to understand\nthe combustion process with liquid propellant combustion devices and to predict\ncombustion oscillation frequencies. The nonlinear behavior (e.g., why does a dis-\nturbance cause an apparently stable combustion to suddenly become unstable?)\nis not well understood and not properly simulated. Mathematical simulations\nrequire a number of assumptions and simplifications to permit feasible solutions\n",
    "368": "9.2. ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION 351\n(see Refs. 9-1 to 9-5, 9-7, 9-11, and 9-12). Good models exist for relatively\nsimple phenomena such as droplets of a propellant vaporizing (see Refs. 9-8\nand 9-10) and burning in a gaseous atmosphere or the steady-state flow of gases\nwith heat release from chemical reactions. The thermochemical equilibrium\nprinciples mentioned in Chapter 5 also apply here. Some programs consider\nturbulence and film cooling effects.\n\nThe following phenomena are usually ignored or greatly simplified: cross\nflows; nonsymmetrical gradients; unsteadiness of the flow; time variations in the\nlocal temperature, local velocity, or local gas composition; thermochemical reac-\ntions at local off-design mixture ratios and at different kinetic rates; enhancement\nof vaporization by acoustic fields (see Ref. 9\u20149); uncertainties in the spatial as\nwell as the size distribution of droplets from sprays; or drag forces on droplets.\nIt requires skilled, experienced personnel to use, interpret, and modify the more\ncomplex programs so that meaningful results and conclusions can be obtained.\nThe outputs of these computer programs can give valuable help and confirmation\nabout the particular design and are useful guides in interpreting actual test results,\nbut by themselves they are not sufficient to determine the designs, select specific\ninjector patterns, or predict the occurrence of combustion instabilities.\n\nAll the existing computer programs known to the authors are suitable for\nsteady-state flow conditions, usually at a predetermined average mixture ratio and\nchamber pressure. However, during the starting, thrust change (such as throttling),\nand stopping transients, the mixture ratio and the pressure can change drastically.\nThe analysis of these transient conditions is more difficult.\n\nThe combustion is strongly influenced by the injector design. The following\nare some of the injection parameters which influence combustion behavior:\ninjector spray or jet pattern, their impingement, hole sizes or hole distribu-\ntion, droplet evaporation, injection pressure drop, mixture ratio, pressure or\ntemperature gradients near the injector, chamber/injector geometry, pressurant\ngas saturation, initial propellant temperature, and liquid injection pressure drop.\nAttempts to analyze these effects have met with only partial success.\n\nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a relatively new analytical tool\nthat can provide a comprehensive description of complex fluid dynamic and\nthermodynamic behavior. It allows for a time history of all parameters and can\neven include some nonlinear effects. Numerical approaches are used to evaluate\nsets of equations and models that represent the behavior of the fluid. For\ncomplex geometries the information has been tracked with more than 150,000\ndiscrete locations and can include changes in gas composition, thermodynamic\nconditions, equilibrium reactions, phase changes, viscous or nonviscous flow,\none-, two-, or three-dimensional flow and steady-state or transient conditions.

    "369": "352 LIQUID PROPELLANT COMBUSTION AND ITS STABILITY\n\n9.3. COMBUSTION INSTABILITY\n\nIf the process of rocket combustion is not controlled (by proper design), then\ncombustion instabilities can occur which can very quickly cause excessive pres-\nsure vibration forces (which may break engine parts) or excessive heat transfer\n(which may melt thrust chamber parts). The aim is to prevent all occurrences\nof this instability and to maintain reliable operation (see Refs. 9-5 and 9-11 to\n9-14). Much progress has been made in understanding and avoiding combustion\ninstability.\n\nReferences 9\u20141 to 9-3 and 9-5 to 9-7 describe the analysis and behavior\nof combustion instability in thrust chamberts as practiced in the United States.\nReferences 9-13 and 9\u201414 present the same but as practiced in Russia and its\npredecessor the Soviet Union. There are some differences in the assumptions,\nanalysis, and testing, but the basic approach is essentially similar. In both coun-\ntries any new or modified thrust chamber and/or rocket engine has to be tested\nto demonstrate that combustion instability will not occur.\n\nTable 9-2 lists the principal types of combustion vibrations encountered in\nliquid rocket thrust chambers (see Refs. 9-3 and 9-9). Admittedly, combustion\nin a liquid rocket is never perfectly smooth; some fluctuations of pressure, tem-\nperature, and velocity are always present. When these fluctuations interact with\nthe natural frequencies of the propellant feed system (with and without vehicle\nstructure) or the chamber acoustics, periodic superimposed oscillations, recog-\nnized as instability, occur. In normal rocket practice smooth combustion occurs\nwhen pressure fluctuations during steady operation do not exceed about +5% of\nthe mean chamber pressure. Combustion that gives greater pressure fluctuations\nat a chamber wall location which occur at completely random intervals is called\nrough combustion. Unstable combustion, or combustion instability, displays orga-\nnized oscillations occurring at well-defined intervals with a pressure peak that\nmay be maintained, may increase, or may die out. These periodic peaks, repre-\nsenting fairly large concentrations of vibratory energy, can be easily recognized\nagainst the random-noise background (see Fig. 9-2).\n\nChugging, the first type of combustion instability listed in Table 9-2, stems\nmostly from the elastic nature of the feed systems and structures of vehicles or\nthe imposition of propulsion forces upon the vehicle. Chugging of an engine\nor thrust chamber assembly can occur in a test facility, especially with low cham-\nber pressure engines (100 to 500 psia), because of propellant pump cavitation,\ngas entrapment in propellant flow, tank pressurization control fluctuations, and\nvibration of engine supports and propellant lines. It can be caused by resonances\nin the engine feed system (such as an oscillating bellows inducing a periodic\nflow fluctuation) or a coupling of structural and feed system frequencies.\n\nWhen both the vehicle structure and the propellant liquid in the feed system\nhave about the same natural frequency, then force coupling can occur, not\nonly to maintain but also to strongly amplify oscillations. Propellant flow rate\ndisturbances, usually at 10 to 50 Hz, give rise to low-frequency longitudinal\ncombustion instability, producing a longitudinal motion of vibration in the\n",

This vehicle flight instability phenomenon has been called pogo\ninstability since it is similar to pogo jumping stick motion. Pogo instabilities\ncan occur in the large, long propellant feed lines of large vehcles such as space\nlaunch vehicles or ballistic missiles. See Refs. 9-15 to 9-17.\n\nAvoiding objectionable engine\u2014vehicle coupled oscillation is best accom-\nplished at the time of initial design of the vehicle, as contrasted to applying\n\u201cfixes\u201d later as has been the case with rocket engines for the Thor, Atlas, and\nTitan vehicles. Analytical methods exist for understanding the vibration modes\nand damping tendencies of major vehicle components, including the propellant\ntanks, tank pressurization systems, propellant flow lines, engines, and basic vehi-\ncle structure. Figure 9\u20143, a simplified spring\u2014mass model of a typical two-stage\nvehicle, indicates the complexity of the analytical problem. Fortunately, the vibra-\ntional characteristics of the assembly can be affected substantially by designing\ndamping (energy absorption) into the major components or subassemblies. Tech-\nniques for damping pogo instability include the use of energy absorption devices\nin fluid flow lines, perforated tank liners, special tank supports, and properly\ndesigned engine, interstage, and payload support structures.\n\nA partially gas-filled pogo accumulator has been an effective damping device;\nit is attached to the main propellant feed line. Such an accumulator is used in\nthe oxidizer feed line of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) betwen the two\noxidizer turbopumps; it can be seen in Figs. 6\u20141 and 6\u201412. The SSME fuel line\ndoes not need such a damping device because the fuel has a relatively very low\ndensity and a lower mass flow.\n",

    "373": "356 LIQUID PROPELLANT COMBUSTION AND ITS STABILITY\nThe third type, screeching or screaming, has high frequency and is most\nperplexing and most common in the development of new engines. Both liquid and\nsolid propellant rockets commonly experience high-frequency instability during\ntheir development phase. Since energy content increases with frequency, this\ntype is the most destructive, capable of destroying an engine in much less than\n1 sec. Once encountered, it is the type for which it is most difficult to prove that\nthe incorporated \u201cfixes\u201d or improvements render the engine \u201cstable\u201d under all\nlaunch and flight conditions. It can be treated as a phenomenon isolated to the\ncombustion chamber and not generally influenced by feed system or structure.\nHigh-frequency instability occurs in at least two modes, longitudinal and\ntransverse. The longitudinal mode (sometimes called organ pipe mode) prop-\nagates along axial planes of the combustion chamber, and the pressure waves\nare reflected at the injector face and the converging nozzle cone. The trans-\nverse modes propagate along planes perpendicular to the chamber axis and can\nbe broken down into tangential and radial modes. Transverse mode instability\npredominates in large liquid rockets, particularly in the vicinity of the injec-\ntor. Figure 9\u20144 shows the distribution of pressure at various time intervals in\na cylindrical combustion chamber (cross section) encountering transverse mode\ninstability. Two kinds of wave form have been observed for tangential vibrations.\nOne can be considered a standing wave that remains fixed in position while its\npressure amplitude fluctuates. The second is a spinning or traveling tangential\nwave which has associated with it a rotation of the whole vibratory system. This\nwaveform can be visualized as one in which the amplitude remains constant\nwhile the wave rotates. Combinations of transverse and longitudinal modes can\nalso occur and their frequency can also be estimated. See Refs. 9-3 to 9-6.\nEnergy that drives screeching is believed to be predominantly from\nacoustically stimulated variations in droplet vaporization and/or mixing, local det-\nonations, and acoustic changes in combustion rates. Thus, with favorable acoustic\nproperties, high-frequency combustion instability, once triggered, can rapidly\ndrive itself into a destructive mode. Invariable, a distinct boundary layer seems\nto disappear and heat transfer rates increase by an order of magnitude, much\nas with detonation, causing metal melting and wall burn-throughs, sometimes\nwithin less than 1 sec. The tangential modes appear to be the most damaging,\nheat transfer rates during instability often increasing 4 to 10 times. Often the\ninstantaneous pressure peaks are about twice as high as with stable operation.\nOne possible source of triggering high-frequency instability is a rocket\ncombustion phenomenon called popping. Popping is an undesirable random\nhigh-amplitude pressure disturbance that occurs during steady-state operation of\na rocket engine with hypergolic propellants. It is a possible source for initiation\nof high-frequency instability. \u201cPops\u201d exhibit some of the characteristics of a\ndetonation wave. The rise time of the pressure is a few microseconds and the\npressure ratio across the wave can be as high as 7:1. The elimination of popping\nis usually achieved by redesign of the injector rather than by the application of\nbaffles or absorbers. They are explained later in this chapter.\n",

These include: (1) nondirectional \u201cbombs\u201d placed\nwithin the combustion chamber; (2) oriented explosive pulses from a \u201cpulse\ngun\u201d directed through the chamber sidewall; and (3) directed flows of inert\ngas through the sidewall into the chamber. Often heavy prototype thrust\nchambers are used because they are less expensive and more resistant to damage\nthan flight-weight engines. Other techniques used less widely but which are\nimportant, especially for small engines include: (1) momentary operation at\n\u201coff-mixture ratio;\u201d (2) introduction of \u201cslugs\u201d of inert gas into a propellant\nline; and (3) a purposeful \u201chard start\u201d achieved by introducing a quantity of\nunreacted propellant at the beginning of the operation.\n\nThe objective of these rating techniques is to measure and demonstrate the\nability of an engine system to return quickly to normal or rated operation and\nstable combustion after the combustion process has intentionally been disturbed\nor perturbed.\n\nAll techniques are intended to introduce shock waves into the combustion\nchamber or to otherwise perturb the combustion process, affording opportunity\nfor measuring recovery time from a predetermined overpressure disturbance,\nassuming stable combustion resumes. Important to the magnitude and\nmode of the instability are the type of explosive charge selected, the size of\nthe charge, the location and direction of the charge, and the duration of the\nexciting pulse. The bottom curve in Fig. 9-2 characterizes the recovery of\nstable operation after a combustion chamber was \u201cbombed.\u201d The time interval\nto recover and the magnitude of explosive or perturbation pressure are then\nused to rate the resistance of the engine to instability.\n",
    "377": "360 LIQUID PROPELLANT COMBUSTION AND ITS STABILITY\n\nThe nondirectional bomb method and the explosive pulse-gun method are\nthe two techniques in more common use. The bomb that can be used in large\nflight-weight thrust chambers without modification consists of six charges of\n250 grains or 16.2 grams of explosive (PETN, RDX, or similar) encased in\na Teflon, nylon, or micarta case. Detonation of the bomb is achieved either\nelectrically or thermally. Although the pulse gun requires modification of\na combustion chamber, this technique affords directional control, which is\nimportant to tangential modes of high-frequency instability and allows several\ndata points to be observed in a single test run by installing several pulse guns\non one combustion chamber. Charges most frequently used are 10, 15, 20, 40,\nand 80 grains of pistol powder. Pulse guns can be fired in sequence, introducing\nsuccessive pressure perturbations (approximately 150 msec apart), each of\nincreasing intensity, into the combustion chamber.\n\nControl of Instabilities\n\nThe control or really the complete elimination of instabilities is an important\ntask during the design and development of a rocket engine. The designer usually\nrelies on prior experience with similar engines and tests on new experimental\nengines. Analytical tools are available with which to simulate and evaluate the\ncombustion process. The design selection has to be proven in actual experiments\nto be free of instabilities over a wide range of transient and steady-state operating\nconditions. Some of the experiments can be accomplished on a subscale rocket\nthrust chamber that has a similar injector, but most tests have to be done on a\nfull-scale engine.\n\nThe design features to control instabilities are different for the three types\nof vibrations described in Table 9-2. Chugging is usually avoided if there is no\nresonance in the propellant feed system or its coupling with the elastic vehicle\nstructure. Increased injection pressure drop and the addition of artificial damping\ndevices in the propellant feed lines have been used successfully. Chugging and\nacoustical instabilities sometimes relate to the natural frequency of a particular\nfeed system component that is free to oscillate, such as a loop of piping that can\nvibrate an injector dome, or a bellows whose oscillations cause a pumping effect.\n\nWith the choice of the propellant combination usually fixed early in the plan-\nning of a new engine, the designer can alter combustion feedback (depressing the\ndriving mechanism) by altering injector details (such as changing the injector hole\npattern, hole sizes, or by increasing the injection pressure drop), or alternatively\nby increasing acoustical damping within the combustion chamber. Of the two\nmethods, the second has been favored in recent years because it is very effective,\nit is better understood, and theory fits. This leads to the application of injector\nface baffles, discrete acoustic energy absorption cavities , and combustion chamber\nliners or changes in injector design, often by using a trial-and-error approach.\n\nInjector face baffles (see Fig. 9-6) were a widely accepted design practice in\nthe 1960s for overcoming or preventing high-frequency instability.

The baffles minimize influential coupling\nand amplification of gas dynamic forces within the chamber. Obviously, baffles\nmust be strong, have excellent resistance to combustion temperatures (they are\nusually cooled by propellant), and must protrude into the chamber enough to be\neffective, yet not so far as to act like an individual combustion chamber with\nits own acoustical characteristics. The number of baffle compartments is usually\nodd. An even number of compartments enhances the standing modes of insta-\nbility, with the baffles acting as nodal lines separating regions of relatively high\nand low pressure. The design and development of baffles remains largely empir-\nical. Generally, baffles are designed to minimize acoustical frequencies below\n4000 Hz, since experience has shown damaging instability is rare at frequencies\nabove 4000 Hz.\n\nVarious mechanisms of energy absorption or vibration damping exist in a\nthrust chamber. Damping by wall friction in combustion chambers is not sig-\nnificant. The exhaust nozzle produces the main damping of longitudinal mode\noscillations; the reflection of waves from the convergent nozzle entrance departs\nfrom that of an ideal closed end. The principal damping source affecting propa-\ngation in the transverse plane is combustion itself. The great volumetric change\nin going from liquid to burned gases and the momentum imparted to a particle\n(solid or liquid) both constitute damping phenomena in that they take energy\nfrom high instantaneous local pressures.

COMBUSTION INSTABILITY 363\npropellant rocket engine shown in Fig. 8\u20142 has acoustic absorption cavities in\nthe chamber wall at a location next to the injector.\n\nThe resonance frequency f of a Helmholtz cavity can be estimated as\n\n< A 9-2\n\nfax V(L+ AL) 0-2)\n\nHere a is the local acoustic velocity, A is the restrictor area, A = (1/4)a?, and\n\nother symbols are as shown in Fig. 9\u20147. The AL is an empirical factor between\n\n0.05 and 0.9L to allow for additional oscillating gas mass. It varies with the\n\nL/d ratio and the edge condition of the restricted orifice (sharp edge, rounded,\n\nchamfered). Resonators in thrust chambers are tuned or designed to perform their\nmaximum damping at predicted frequencies.\n\nSmall changes in injector geometry or design can cause an unstable combustion\nto become stable and vice versa. New injectors, therefore, use the design and\ngeometry of proven, stable prior designs with the same propellants. For example,\nthe individual pattern of concentric tube injector elements used with gaseous\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen (shown in Fig. 8\u20144d) are likely to be more stable,\nif the hydrogen gas is relatively warm and the injection velocity of the hydrogen\nis at least 10 times larger than that of the liquid oxygen.\n\nThere are other combustion vibration remedies besides those that have\nalready been mentioned, such a baffles or resonance cavities. This includes\nhigher injection pressure drop, avoiding resonance with certain key engine\ncomponent structures, changing critical injector dimension details, changing or\nmodifying the propellant, or adding liners. References 9-3 and 9-6 describe\nseveral others, such as cooled flame holders, eliminating the entry of gases\ninto the chamber during combustion, changing the locations of maximum heat\nrelease, varying critical dimensions on the injector elements, varying the number\nof injector elements and their distribution over the cross section of the chamber,\nchanging the mixture ratio to be nonuniform near the face of the injector, or\ntemporary consumable baffles, which are effective only during the start.\n\nIn summary, the designer needs to (1) use data from prior successful engines\nand simulation programs to establish key design features and estimate the likely\nresonances of the engine and its major components, (2) design the feed system\nand structure to avoid these resonances, (3) use a robust injector design that will\nprovide good mixing and dispersion of propellants and be resistant to distur-\nbances, and (4) if needed, include tuned damping devices (cavities) to overcome\nacoustic oscillations. To validate that a particular thrust chamber is stable, it is\nnecessary to test it over the range of likely operating conditions without encoun-\ntering instability. An analysis is needed to determine the maximum and minimum\nlikely propellant temperatures, maximum and minimum probable chamber pres-\nsures, and the highest and lowest mixture ratios, using a propellant budget as\nshown in Section 11.1. These limits then establish the variations of test condi-\ntions for this test series. Because of our improved understanding, the amount of\ntesting needed to prove stability has been reduced compared to that required 20\nto 40 years ago.\n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThis is the first revised edition of this book, which has a separate chapter on tur-\nbopumps (abbreviated here as TP) and their gas supplies. A TP is a high-pressure\nhigh-precision piece of rotating high-speed power machinery usually consisting\nof a turbine driving one or two centrifugal propellant pumps. Its purpose is to\ntake propellants from the vehicle\u2019s propellant tanks, raise their pressure, and\ndeliver these propellants into the high-pressure piping system. The pressurized\npropellants are then fed to one or more thrust chambers, where they are burned\nand form hot gases. A TP is a unique key component of all larger liquid propel-\nlant rocket engines with a pumped feed system and its design, fabrication, and\nfunctions are unlike any of the other rocket engine components. This chapter dis-\ncusses the various common types of TPs, outlines one design approach, describes\nmajor TP components, and mentions some of their principal design issues.\n\nA well-designed TP delivers the intended propellant flows at the intended\npump discharge pressures and mixture ratio, must have good enough reliabil-\nity so that it will not malfunction or fail during the intended flight duration,\nand many will run at the highest practical energy efficiency of the pumps and\nturbines. Furthermore the TP should not stimulate or cause any significant vibra-\ntion (in the engine or vehicle) or should not be adversely affected by externally\ncaused vibrations, will function well over all operating conditions (such as dif-\nferent initial propellant temperatures, a range of ambient temperatures, start and\nstop transients, accelerations in the flight direction and other directions) at the\n366\n",

It is important that the pumps will not cavitate\nbecause the cavitation bubbles can reduce the steady nominal propellant flow and\ncan cause combustion instability. Cavitation is discussed later in Section 10.5.\nThe bearings and seals need to be adequately cooled by small secondary flows\nof propellant within the TP assembly to prevent their overheating and malfunc-\ntioning. There should not be any unexpected leakage in the seals and secondary\nflow passages within a TP; this means leaks between bipropellants, between tur-\nbine stages (gas) or pump stages (liquid), between a propellant and hot gas, or\nbetween propellant or hot gas and the outside.\n\nThe selection of a specific TP configuration, such as those seen later in this\nchapter, will depend on the propellant combination, the desired flows and pump\ndischarge pressures, the engine cycle, the available suction pressure, the number\nof units to be built and delivered, and other factors. The available proven heat-\nresistant materials and their maximum working temperatures for turbine blades\nor the maximum load capacity of a bearing can influence the design selection.\nThe best placement of a TP within a rocket engine is usually a compromise\nbetween several design considerations. For example, its inlet and outlet flanges\nshould be placed to minimize the piping, access bearings and turbine blades\nfor inspection on reusable engines, mounting which allows thermal expansion\nwithout high stresses, or the simplicity of the design (e.g., minimum number of TP\ncomponents) \u2014all these will influence the choice of the TP design configuration.\nReferences 10\u20141 to 10-5 give further information on TP selection and design.\n10.2. DESCRIPTIONS OF SEVERAL TURBOPUMPS\nTypical TPs can be seen in Figs. 10\u20141 to 10-3 and 6-10, and many key compo-\nnents can be identified by their callouts. Most of the part names in these figures\nwill be discussed in subsequent paragraphs of this chapter. TPs are also seen as a\ncomponent of an engine in Figs. 6-1, 6-11, 6\u201412, and 8-17. Figure 6-2 gives\na diagram of various common feed system arrangements; many have one or more\nTPs. A number of different arrangements of the key TP components for several\ncommon TP assemblies are shown in Fig. 10\u20144. This includes different numbers\nof pumps and turbines, different component arrangements on TP shafts, with or\nwithout gear cases, or with and without booster pumps. All will be discussed\nlater in this chapter. Figures 10-1 and 10-2 are experimental TPs. They were\nselected for this book because they clearly identify the key components. (see Ref.\n10-6). Figure 10\u20141 shows a single-stage propellant pump; it has a screw-type\naxial-flow inducer impeller ahead of the main impeller, is driven by a single-\nstage axial-flow turbine. The hot combustion gases, which drive this turbine, are\nburned in a separate gas generator (or a precombustion chamber or preburner)\nat a mixture ratio that gives gases between 900 and 1200 K; this is sufficiently\ncool, so that the hot turbine hardware (blades, nozzles, manifolds, or disks) still\nhave sufficient strength without needing forced cooling. The gases are expanded\n(accelerated) in an annular set of converging\u2014diverging supersonic turbine inlet\n",

SELECTION OF TURBOPUMP CONFIGURATION\n\nThe selection of the features, performance, and configuration of a specific new\nTP arrangement can be complex.

These engine criteria\nhave to be evaluated, weighed, and prioritized. Furthermore it depends on the\nengine cycle (see Section 6.6 and Fig. 6\u20149), propellant physical properties (such\nas vapor pressure, density, or viscosity), the nominal flows and pump discharge\npressures (sum of chamber pressure, hydraulic losses in valves, cooling jacket,\ninjector, and pipes), minimum practical inert TP mass, high reliability (no flight\nfailures allowed), available suction pressure, maximum and minimum propel-\nlant and hardware initial temperatures, and the components arrangement of the\nassembly. It is also influenced by the size of the TP, the location of the TPs\ninlet and outlet flanges relative to the thrust chamber inlets and the suction pipes\noutlets, maximum allowable turbine gas inlet temperature (which depends on the\nturbine material), number of hot starts during the life time, critical speed of the\nrotating assembly, or the simplicity of the design (e.g., fewest number of parts).\nIf reuse is an engine requirement, then additional factors have to be considered,\nsuch as ease of access to bearings, seals, or turbine blades for inspection of wear\nor cracks. With throttling of the thrust the TP has to operate efficiently over a\nrange of speeds. There can be other TP selection criteria. Some of the preliminary\nselection and design criteria are explained in Refs. 10-1 to 10-3 and 10-5 and\nbasic texts on pumps are in Refs. 10\u20148 and 10-9.\n\nThe shaft speed is related to the TP diameter or size and thus to the TP mass.\nThe tip speed of the pump impeller blades or the speed of the turbine blades at\ntheir mean diameter can be the same at different diameters and rotational speeds.\nObviously, the highest practical shaft speed gives the smallest diameter, and thus\nusually the lowest inert TP mass. This is often in conflict with other criteria, such\nas cavitation avoidance, which is likely to be more difficult if the impeller speed\nis increased. It will be discussed later in this section.\n\nThe arrangements of the various key TP components into an assembly can be\nan important design criteria. Figure 10\u20144 shows several common arrangements.\nThe two most common are to have one turbine with two propellant pumps on the\nsame shaft (Figs. 10\u20144a and 10-\u20144b) and two smaller separate TPs, one where\na turbine drives an oxidizer pump and one where another turbine drives a fuel\npump (Fig. 10\u20144e). In Fig. 10\u20144a the fuel pump inlet has a shaft going through\nit and that will affect the suction pressure. In the TP in Fig. 10\u20144b the turbine\nrequires more seals. Although not discussed here, the placement and selection of\nbearings and seals influences the TP selection.\n\nCentrifugal pumps are used in all known production TPs, and these are basi-\ncally constant-volume flow devices (Refs. 10\u20143, 10-4, 10-5, 10-8, and 10-9).\nIf the two propellants have similar densities (say within about 40%), such as\nnitrogen tetroxide and UDMH or liquid oxygen and kerosene and the volume\nflow of oxidizer and of fuel are similar, then the same type of impeller (running\n",

Instead two separate TPs are used\u2014rotating at high\nspeed for the fuel pump and lower speed for the oxidizer pump\u2014thus giving\ngood pump efficiencies. This corresponds to Fig. 10\u20144e.\nIt is at times difficult to package a relatively large TP into an engine package.\nThe two-TP configuration is often easier to integrate into an engine assembly,\n",
    "391": "374 TURBOPUMPS AND THEIR GAS SUPPLIES\n\nboth pumps will be able to run at a relatively high efficiency, the TP will have\nfewer seals, and since the shafts are shorter, they are lighter for the same shaft\nstiffness.\n\nFigure 10\u20144g shows two shafts, in line with each other, with a mechanical cou-\npling between them (Ref. 10-10). In this example the fuel pump and the turbine\nare on one shaft and the oxidizer pump on the other. The two shafts are connected\nby a flexible coupling, and this allows considerable shaft misalignment, and as\na result some more generous fabrication and assembly tolerances in the TP. The\nfirst two-shaft inline TP assembly was in the German V-2 rocket engine (1938)\nwith a six pin/sleeve type of flexible coupling. The Soviet Union developed a\ncurvic coupling serrated sleeve as a coupling and it was smaller and lighter. Ref-\nerences 10\u20141 and 10\u20144 show a section view of these two TPs. The United States\ndid not produce a TP with two inline coupled shafts. When compared to a larger\nsingle shaft, the smaller spans between bearings on each of the two shafts results\nin substantially smaller shaft diameters, which in turn can reduce the mass of the\nshafts, the diameter and mass of pumps and pump housings, and the inertia of\nthe rotary assembly and can allow some increases of the shaft speed.\n\nFigures 10\u20144d and 10\u20144f show TPs with a gear case to transmit the power\nfrom the turbine to the pumps (Ref. 10-11). The purpose is to allow the turbine\nto run at high speed and the pumps to rotate at lower speeds, where the efficien-\ncies are relatively high, thus minimizing the amount of gas generator propellant\nneeded to drive the TP. Gear cases for TPs were common in the United States\nbeginning in the early 1950s and one is still in use. In Fig. 10\u20144e the turbine\nruns at a higher speed and the two pumps run at lower, but somewhat different\nspeeds. In Fig. 10\u20144f the fuel is liquid hydrogen; the fuel pump and the turbine\nrun at a higher speed on the same shaft and the oxygen pump is geared down to\na lower speed.\n\nFigures 10\u20144e and 10\u20144h represent two arrangements for using booster TPs\nin addition to the two main TPs. See Ref. 10-12. The purpose is to reduce\nthe vehicle\u2019s tank pressure and inert mass further, thus improving the vehicle\nperformance. A typical booster TP provides about 10% of the propellant pressure\nrise and the respective main pump about 90%. Booster pumps typically use axial-\nflow impellers, and a few can operate with considerable cavitation in the leading\nedges of the booster impellers. With a booster pump the pressure at the inlet to the\nmain pump is raised enough so cavitation does not occur in these higher pressure\nimpellers. The low rotating speed causes the booster pumps to have a relatively\nlarge diameter. In some liquid propellant rocket engines they are larger than the\nmain pump. Since pressures in booster pumps are low, the walls are thin, and\nthe booster pump inert mass can be low. Most of the turbines of booster TPs are\ndriven by gas expansion, but some are powered by high-pressure liquid propellant\ntaken from the discharge of the main pump. The total number worldwide of rocket\nengines with booster pumps is small, perhaps a dozen. Booster pumps provide\nlow suction pressure and good cavitation resistance to the main pumps of the\nengines, but the engines are more complex and more costly.\n\nBearings and seals will be overloaded or fail if the shaft deflects (even by a\nsmall amount like 0.001 in. in some TPs). See Refs. 10-13 and 10-14. In order to\n",
    "392": "10.3. SELECTION OF TURBOPUMP CONFIGURATION 375\nminimize deflection of the shaft, the shaft has to be stiff (less deflection for a given\nside load) and that means large in diameter and heavy. The rotating assembly\n(turbine, pumps, seals, bearings) has to be carefully balanced. An unbalance\ncauses a side load (which can be substantial at high rotational speed) and a\ndeflection of the shaft. Both accurate static and dynamic balances are usually\nrequired during assembly. The operating speed of the rotating assembly is never\nchosen to be the same as the resonant or critical shaft speed, where deflections\ncan become very high and the bearings, seals, or even the shaft can fail. The\nsynchronous or critical speed is usually well above the operating speed. A stiffer\nshaft (larger diameter, heavier, a shorter distance between bearings, and less\noverhang beyond the bearing) gives a higher critical speed and allows the pumps\nto run at higher speed, which allows a lighter TP assembly. There are some TP\nwhere the operating speed is actually above the critical speed. Here the shaft\nmomentarily goes trough the critical speed during startup and shutdown.\n\nThere are usually several secondary flow passages in a TP. A bearing, rotating\nshaft seal, or impeller wear ring are all usually cooled and/or lubricated with a\nvery small flow of propellant, which is heated in the process and can then be\nfed back to the suction side of a pump or dumped overboard. It requires a set\nof small external tubes or internal passages in the TP assembly to route several\nsmall flows for achieving this cooling and lubrication of rubbing surfaces. There\nis a good number of seals and bearings that need a small propellant supply and\nthe distribution system for this propellant can be complex; some routes have to\nbe throttled to the desired small flow, and a mixing of unlike propellants has to\nbe avoided. The analysis of these secondary flow passages can be tedious. If a\nbearing or seal is close to a turbine, they will get warm (needs more coolant) and\nif they are pumping a cryogenic propellant, the adjacent hardware will become\nvery cold. The clearances of these bearings or seals have to be so designed that\nthe intended clearance is correct at the operating conditions.\n\nBubbles in the flow of propellant are indeed unwanted. They can be introduced\ninto the propellant feed pipes by extensive cavitation in the pumps, (see Refs.\n10\u20144 and 10-9) by leaks in low-pressure suction piping, or by improper priming\nor filling of the propellant lines before or during start. Bubbles reduce the effec-\ntive density of the propellant, which in turn reduces the mass flow and the mixture\nratio and usually reduces the thrust level somewhat below the nominal value. If\nthe intended operating mixture ratio was fuel rich and bubbles were to reduce\nthe fuel flow, this mixture ratio will approach a stochiometric value; this creates\na very hot gas and would most likely cause a failure of the cooling jacket in less\nthan a second. A major concern with bubbles is that they can readily trigger com-\nbustion instability (see Chapter 9), which often leads to thrust chamber failure.\nThe key design objectives are to select a high enough shaft speed (which gives\nthe smallest and lightest TP, but is still not prone to cavitation), a low enough\npump suction pressure (which gives the lightest vehicle tank mass, but this pro-\nmotes pump cavitation), and an impeller configuration, which will be strong and\nefficient and prevent dangerous cavitation under all operating conditions.\n\nA balance of axial fluid pressure forces within the TP rotatinggassembly and\nits housings is necessary to prevent excessive axial hydraulic pressure forces\n",

Unbalance would cause a small axial movement of the\nrotating assembly (typically just a few thousands of an inch) and often intense\nrubbing of stationary and rotating parts. These pressure forces are created by\nthe fluids flowing through the pump paths (increasing pressures) and the turbine\ngases flowing through moving and stationary sets of turbine blades (decreasing\npressures), and by the radial placement of wear rings or seals. Some turbopumps\nhave balancing pistons and some use the fluid pressures on the back side of an\nimpeller or turbine disk to make an effective balance piston. Pressure on the\npiston is controlled by a slight axial movement, which changes clearances at the\nedge of the piston. During the transient operations (start, stop, change thrust),\nthere typically are brief periods of unbalance caused by changes in the pressure\ndistributions of the internal flows, but they are of short duration. Nevertheless\nthere can be some rubbing or axial contact of a rotating and a stationery surface\nnormal to the shaft during the brief periods of unbalance. If the axial rubbing\ncontact persists, there will be some damage to the TP.\n10.4. FLOW, SHAFT SPEEDS, POWER, AND PRESSURE BALANCES\nThe design of a TP requires the careful balancing of the propellant flows, the\nshaft speeds, and the power between the key pumps and turbines and the pressure\ndistribution of the propellant along its flow paths. For a TP with two pumps and a\ngear transmission, the shaft speeds can be written as in Eq. 10-1. The relationship\nbetween shaft speeds, torques, and power can readily be seen by reviewing a flow\ndiagram of a TP such as Fig. 1-4. With a gear case the relation between shaft\nspeeds can be written as\nN; = doNo = ag N\u00a2 (10-1)\nHere N is the shaft speed, the subscripts \u00a2, f, and o stand for turbine, fuel pump,\nand oxidizer pump, respectively. The a, and af are the gear ratios for the oxidizer\nand fuel pumps. When there are no gears, then a, and ay become 1.0. For a TP\nsimilar to Fig. 10\u20144a and 10\u20144b:\nN, =Ne =No and L,=Ly + Ly + Ly (10-2)\nHere Ly, is the torque to overcome friction in bearings, seals, or auxiliaries. For\na TP as in Figs.10\u20144a and 10\u20144b, the power of the turbine P; has to equal the\nsum of the powers of the pumps plus some losses. This power balance can also\nbe expressed as the product of the torque L and the speed N:\nP, => Pp+Ps (10-3)\nP, =L,N, =L\u00a2Np + LoNo + Po (10-4)\n",
    "394": "10.4. FLOW, SHAFT SPEEDS, POWER, AND PRESSURE BALANCES 377\nHere P;, is the power for overcoming the friction in all the bearings and seals,\nand in some TP configurations also the power loss in gears, and auxiliaries (such\nas an oil pump for lubricating gears). The power P\u00bb used in bearing, seals, and\nauxiliaries is usually small.\n\nFor the two separated TP scheme in Fig. 10\u20144e each of the TPs has its own\ninternal losses. It is obvious that the speeds N and the power P and even the\ntorques L must balance in this configuration:\n\n(Ni)o = (po and (Nip = (Np )p (10-5)\n(Pio =(Pp)o + (Po)o and (Pr )\u00a2 = (Ppp + (Pop (10-6)\n\nThe subscripts \u00a2 and p stand for turbine and pump. The pressure balance\nequation for the fuel line (the oxidizer line is the same) at a point just past the\nfuel pump discharge flange can be written as\n\n(pp)a = (Pp)s + (Ape) pump (10-7)\n\n= (AP) main fuel system + P1\n\n= (AP)agas generator fuel system + Pgg\nHere the fuel pump discharge pressure (py) equals the fuel pump suction pres-\nsure (Ap,)s plus the pressure rise across the pump (Ap)pump. This discharge\npressure in turn has to equal the chamber pressure p, plus all the pressure drops\nin the high-pressure main fuel flow system downstream of the pump and upstream\nof the chamber. This usually includes the pressure losses in the cooling jacket,\nthe injector, the piping, and the open fuel valve. This pump discharge pressure\nfurthermore has to equal the gas generator combustion pressure pgg and all the\npressure losses between the fuel pump discharge and the gas generator combus-\ntion chamber. A similar pressure balance is needed for the oxidizer systems.\n\nThe fourth type of balance is different from the other three (flow, pressure, and\npower balance); it is aimed at preventing certain high-pressure axial hydraulic\nloads and/or axial gas pressure loads from causing damage inside the TP assem-\nbly See Refs. 10-1, 10-4, and 10-15. These axial internal loads (side forces\non impellers or turbine disks) can be very high, particularly in large sized TPs.\nCertain ball bearings are capable of withstanding considerable axial loads, in\naddition to the usual radial loads. The axial movement of the rotating assembly\nis limited by design and is very small. This method of controlling axial forces\nwith a ball bearing is used in many TPs, but usually the maximum axial load\nof ball bearings is limited; therefore it is used mostly with small-diameter TPs\nor low-pressure TPs. A balance of axial fluid pressure forces within a large TP\nrotating assembly and its large stationary housing assembly can be accomplished\nby balance pistons. Some TPs have balancing pistons and some use the fluid\npressures on the back side of an impeller or turbine disk to make an effective\nbalance piston. Otherwise it would cause undesirable rubbing of certain parts\nof the rotating TP assembly with parts of the stationary TP housing assembly.\n",
    "395": "378 TURBOPUMPS AND THEIR GAS SUPPLIES\n\nUnbalanced large high-pressure loads cause a very small axial movement of the\nrotating assembly (typically just 0.001 to 0.003 inch) and the balancing mech-\nanism can be usually designed to prevent further axial movement and intense\nrubbing of stationary and rotating parts. Pressure on the balance piston is con-\ntrolled by a slight axial movement, which changes the circular clearances at the\nedge of the piston, and the rotating assembly is kept from moving more that\na couple of thousands of an inch. During the transient operations (start, stop,\nchange thrust) there typically are brief periods of unbalance caused by changes\nin the pressure distributions on the internal surfaces normal to the shaft, but they\nare of short duration. Nevertheless there can be some rubbing or axial contact of\na rotating and a stationery surface normal to the shaft during the brief periods\nof unbalance. If the axial rubbing contact persists, there will usually be some\ndamage to the TP.\n\nA phenomena characteristic of rotating machinery is the relative displacement\nand very small movement of the center of the rotating shaft within the con-\nfinement of small clearances of a fixed sleeve bearing; this is known as whirl.\nReference 10\u201416 describes a condition where the relative small movement of the\nshaft\u2019s center is synchronous or the same as the rotation movement of the shaft\nitself (revolutions per unit time).\n\nThe above equations relate to the steady-state operating condition. The tran-\nsient and dynamic conditions are important and many have been analyzed using\niterative procedures and digital computers. Many have been tested, as shown\nin Ref. 10-17. They are the start, stop, and thrust change. For example, the\ntransient starting condition includes the tank pressurization, the filling of pipes,\npumps, or manifolds with liquid propellants, the filling of turbines and their man-\nifolds with heated gas, ignition of gas generators, or thrust buildup. However, no\ndetailed discussion of these transient conditions will be given in this book. These\ndynamic conditions can be complex, are related to the combustion behavior, and\nare sometimes difficult to analyze. Each major rocket propulsion organization has\ndeveloped some method for analyzing these transients and they are often specific\nto specific engines or specific organizations. A similar yet simpler and different\ntransient analysis of flows and pressure drops is usually performed for engines\nwith a pressurized gas feed system.\n\n10.5.

In some pumps the curved diffuser vanes are\nupstream of the collector. The three-dimensional hydraulic design of impeller\nvanes, diffuser vanes, and volute passages can be accomplished by computer\nprograms to give high efficiency and adequate strength. Internal leakage, or\ncirculation between the high-pressure (discharge) side and the low-pressure (suc-\ntion) side of an impeller, is held to a minimum by maintaining close clearances\nbetween the rotating and stationary parts at the seals or wear ring surfaces.\nExternal leakage along the shaft is minimized or prevented by the use of a shaft\nseal. Single-stage pumps (one impeller only) are stress limited in the pressure\nrise they can impart to the liquid, and multiple-stage pumps are therefore needed\nfor high pump head,\u201d such as with liquid hydrogen. References 10-2, 10-5,\n10-8, 10\u20149, and 10-17 give information on different pumps. There is a free\npassage of flow through the pump at all times, and no positive means for shutoff\nare provided. The pump characteristics, that is, the pressure rise, flow, and effi-\nciency, are functions of the pump speed, the impeller, the vane shape, and the\ncasing configuration. Figure 10\u20146 shows a typical set of curves for centrifugal\npumps. The negative slope on the head versus flow curve indicates a stable pump\nbehavior. Reference 10\u20147 describes the development of a smaller turbopump and\nthe testing of a spiral high-speed first-stage impeller, called an inducer.\n\nA shrouded impeller has a shroud or cover (in the shape of a surface of\nrevolution) on top of the vanes as shown in Figs. 10-1, 10-3, and 10-5. This\ntype usually has higher stresses and lower leakage around the impeller. In an\n*Pump head means the difference between pump discharge and pump suction head. Its units are\nmeters or feet. The head is the height of a column of liquid with equivalent pressure at its bottom.\nThe conversion from pounds per square inch into feet of head is: (X) psi = 144 (X)/density (Ib/ft*).\nTo convert Pascals (N/m*) of pressure into column height (m), divide by the density (kg/m?) and\n80 (9.806m/sec\u2019).\n",

In addi-\ntion to the flow required by the thrust chamber, the propellant consumption of\nthe gas generator, and in some designs also a bypass around the turbine and aux-\niliaries have to be considered in determining the pump flows. The required pump\ndischarge pressure is determined from the chamber pressure and the hydraulic\nlosses in valves, lines, cooling jacket, and injectors (see Eq. 10-7). To obtain\nthe rated flow at the rated pressure, an additional adjustable pressure drop for a\ncontrol valve or orifice is usually included which permits a calibration adjustment\nor change in the required feed pressure. A regulation of the pump speed can also\nchange the required adjustable pressure drop. As described in Section 11.5, this\nadjustment of head and flow is necessary to allow for hydraulic and performance\ntolerances on pumps, valves, injectors, propellant density, and so on.\n\nIt is possible to predict the pump performance at various speeds if the perfor-\nmance is known at any given speed. Because the fluid velocity in a given pump\nis proportional to the pump speed N, the flow quantity or discharge Q is also\nproportional to the speed and the head H is proportional to the square of the\nspeed. This gives the following relations:\n\nQ (flow) ~ N (rpm or rad/sec)\nH (pump head) ~ N2 (10-8)\nP (pump power) ~ N?\n\nFrom these relations it is possible to derive a parameter called the specific\nspeed N,. It is a dimensionless number derived from a dimensional analysis of\npump parameters as shown in Ref. 10-8.\n\nNs =NyQe/(go AHe)*\"\" (10-9)\n\nAny set of consistent units will satisfy the equation: for example, N in radians\nper second, Q in m/sec, go as 9.8m/sec\u201d, and H in meters. The subscript e refers\nto the maximum efficiency condition. In U.S. pump practice it has become the\ncustom to delete go, express N in rpm, and Q in gallons per minute or ft/sec.\nMuch of the existing U.S. pump data is in these units. This leads to a modified\nform of Eq. 10\u20142, where N; is not dimensionless, namely\n\nN, = 21.2N/Q./(AH,)*/4 (10-10)\n",

The continuity equation\nthen is in terms of mass flow in\n\nm = Ajv1p) = A2v2p2 (10-13)\nThe head developed by the pump will then also depend on the change in density.\n\nThe pump performance is limited by cavitation, a phenomenon that occurs\nwhen the static pressure at any point in a fluid flow passage becomes less than\nthe fluid\u2019s vapor pressure. Cavitation is discussed in Refs. 10-1 to 10-5, 10-8,\n10-9, and 10-17. The formation of vapor bubbles in the low-pressure regions\ncauses cavitation. These bubbles collapse when they reach a region of higher\npressure, that is, when the static pressure in the fluid is above the vapor pressure.\nIn centrifugal pumps cavitation is most likely to occur behind the leading edge of\nthe pump impeller vane at the inlet because this is the point at which the lowest\nabsolute pressure is encountered. The excessive formation of vapor causes the\npump discharge mass flow to diminish and fluctuate and can reduce the thrust\nand make the combustion erratic and dangerous.\n\nWhen the bubbles travel along the pump impeller surface from the low-\npressure region (where they are formed) to the downstream higher-pressure\nregion, the bubbles collapse. The sudden collapses create local high-pressure\npulses that have caused excessive stresses in the metal at the impeller surface.\nIn most rocket applications this cavitation erosion is not as serious as in water\nor chemical pumps because the cumulative duration is relatively short and the\nerosion of metal on the impeller is not usually extensive. However, it has been\na concern with some test facility transfer pumps.\n\nThe required suction head (H,)p is the limit value of the head at the pump inlet\n(above the local vapor pressure); below this value cavitation in the impeller may\noccur. It is a function of the pump and impeller design and its value increases\nwith flow as can be seen in Fig. 10\u20146. To avoid cavitation the suction head\nabove the vapor pressure required by the pump (H;)r must always be Jess than\nthe available or net positive suction head furnished by the line up to the pump\n(H,)q, that is, (H,)r < (Hs),4. The required suction head above vapor pressure\ncan be determined from the suction specific speed S:\n\nSs =212N /0./(H);/ (10-14)\nThe suction specific speed S depends on the quality of design and the specific\nspeed N,, as shown in Table 10\u20142. The suction specific speed S has a value\nbetween 5000 and 60,000 when using ft-lbf units. For pumps with poor suc-\ntion characteristics it has values near 5000, for the best pump designs without\ncavitation it has values near 10,000 and 25,000, and for pumps with limited\nand controllable local cavitation it has values above 40,000. In Eq. 10-14 the\nrequired suction head (H,)r is usually defined as the critical suction head at\nwhich the developed pump discharge head has been diminished arbitrarily by\n",

Turbopump\ndevelopment has, over the last several decades, led to impeller designs which\ncan operate successfully with considerably more cavitation than the arbitrary and\ncommonly accepted 2% head loss limit. Inducers are now designed to run stably\nwith extensive vapor bubbles near the leading edge of their vanes, but these bub-\nbles collapse at the trailing end of these vanes. Inducers now can have S values\nabove 80,000. A discussion of one method for the design of impeller blades can\nbe found in Ref. 10-8.\n\nThe head that is available at the pump suction flange is called the net positive\nsuction head or available suction head above vapor pressure (H,),. It is an\nabsolute head value determined from the tank pressure (the absolute gas pressure\nin the tank above the liquid level), the elevation of the propellant level above\nthe pump inlet, diminished by the friction losses in the line between tank and\npump, and the vapor pressure of the fluid. When the flying vehicle is undergoing\naccelerations, the head due to elevation must be corrected accordingly. These\nvarious heads are defined in Fig. 10\u20147.

    "402": "10.5. PUMPS 385\nTo avoid pump cavitation, (H,)4 has to be higher than (H, )r. If additional head\nis required by the pump, the propellant may have to be pressurized by external\nmeans, such as by the addition of another pump in series (called a booster pump)\nor by gas pressurization of the propellant tanks. This latter method requires thicker\ntank walls and, therefore, heavier tanks, and a bigger gas-pressurizing system.\nFor example, the oxygen tank of the German V-2 was pressurized to 2.3 atm,\npartly to avoid pump cavitation. For a given value of (H,),4, propellants with\nhigh vapor pressure require correspondingly higher tank pressures and heavier\ninert tank masses. For a given available suction head (H;)4, a pump with a low\nrequired suction pressure usually permits designs with high shaft speeds, small\ndiameter, and low pump inert mass. A small value of (H;)r is desirable because it\nmay permit a reduction of the requirements for tank pressurization and, therefore,\na lower inert tank mass. The value of (H,) will be small if the impeller and\nfluid passages are well designed and if the shaft speed N is low. A very low\nshaft speed, however, requires a large-diameter pump, which will be excessively\nheavy. The trend in selecting centrifugal pumps for rocket application has been\nto select the highest shaft speed that gives a pump with a low value of (H;)r,\ndoes not require excessive tank pressurization or other design complications, and\nthereby permits relatively lightweight pump design. This places a premium on\npumps with good suction characteristics.\n\nThere have been some low-thrust, low-flow, experimental engines that have\nused positive displacement pumps, such as diaphragm pumps, piston pumps, or\nrotary displacement pumps (gear and vane pumps). For low values of specific\nspeed Ns these pumps have much better efficiencies, but their discharge pressures\nfluctuate with each stroke and they are noisy.\n\nOne method to provide a lightweight turbopump with low vehicle tank pressure\nis to use an inducer, which is a special pump impeller usually on the same shaft\nand rotating at the same speed as the main impeller. It has a low head rise\nand therefore a relatively high specific speed. Inducer impellers are immediately\nupstream of the main impeller. They are basically axial-flow pumps with a spiral\nimpeller, and many will operate under slightly cavitating conditions. The inducer\nstage\u2019s head rise (typically, 2 to 10% of the total pump head) has to be just large\nenough to suppress cavitation in the main pump impeller; this allows a smaller,\nlighter, higher-speed main pump.

Reference 10\u201419 describes the testing of a pump with an inducer.\nMost TPs today have inducers.\n\nInfluence of Propellants\n\nFor the same power and mass flow, the pump head is inversely proportional to\nthe propellant density. Since pumps are basically constant-volume flow machines,\nthe propellant with the highest density requires less head, less power, and thus\nallows a smaller pump assembly.\n\nBecause many of the propellants are dangerous to handle, special provi-\nsions have to be made to prevent any leakage through the shaft seals.

The gas\nis expanded to a high, nearly tangential, velocity and through inclined nozzles and\nthen flows through specially shaped blades, where the gas energy is converted\ninto tangential forces on each blade. These forces cause the turbine wheel to\nrotate (see Refs. 10-1 to 10\u20145, 10-20 and 10-21).\nClassification and Description\nThe majority of turbines have blades at the periphery of a turbine disk and the\ngas flow is axial, similarly in concept to the axial-flow pattern shown for pumps\nin Table 10-2 and the single-stage turbine of Fig. 10-1. However, there are a\nfew turbines with radial flow (particularly at high shaft speeds), such as the one\nshown in Fig. 10-2. Ideally there are two types of axial-flow turbines of interest\nto rocket pump drives: impulse turbines and reaction turbines, as sketched in\nFig. 10-9. In an impulse turbine the enthalpy of the working fluid is converted\ninto kinetic energy within the first set of stationary turbine nozzles and not in\nthe rotating blade elements. High-velocity gases are delivered (at a small angle\nto a tangential direction) to the rotating blades, and blade rotation takes place as\na result of the impulse imparted by the momentum of the fluid stream of high\nkinetic energy to the rotating blades which are mounted on the turbine disk. The\nvelocity-staged impulse turbine has a stationary set of blades which changes the\nflow direction after the gas leaves the first set of rototating blades and directs\nthe gas to enter a second set of rotating blades in which the working fluid gives\nup further energy to the turbine wheel. In a pressure-staged impulse turbine, the\nexpansion of the gas takes place in all the stationary rows of blades. In a reaction\nturbine the expansion of the gas is roughly evenly split between the rotating and\nstationary blade elements. The high-pressure drop available for the expansion of\nthe turbine working fluid in a gas generator cycles favors simple, lightweight\none- or two-stage impulse turbines for high thrust engines. Many rocket turbines\nare neither pure impulse nor reaction turbines, but often are fairly close to an\nimpulse turbine with a small reaction in the rotating vanes.\nWith some gas generator engine cycles the turbine exhaust gases pass through\na De Laval Supersonic nozzle at the exit of the exhaust pipe (see Fig. 1-4). The\nhigh turbine outlet pressure gives critical flow conditions at the venturi throat\n(particularly at high altitudes) and thereby assures a constant turbine outlet pres-\nsure and a constant turbine power which will not vary with altitude. Furthermore,\nit provides a small additional thrust to the engine.\nTurbine Performance and Design Considerations\nThe power supplied by the turbine is given by a combined version of Eqs. 3-1\nand 3-7:\nP; = nrm, Ah (10-17)\nP, = maiarep Ti \u2014 (p2/pry*-P*] (10-18)\n",

This enthalpy is a function of the specific heat c,, the\nnozzle inlet temperature 7, the pressure ratio across the turbine, and the ratio of\nthe specific heats k of the turbine gases. For gas generator cycles the pressure\ndrop between the turbine inlet and outlet is relatively high, but the turbine flow\nis small (typically 2 to 5% of full propellant flow). For staged combustion cycles\nthis pressure drop is very much lower, but the turbine flow is much larger.\nFor very large liquid propellant engines with high chamber pressure the turbine\npower can reach over 250,000 hp, and for small engines this could be perhaps\naround 35 kW or 50 hp.\n",
    "407": "390 TURBOPUMPS AND THEIR GAS SUPPLIES\n\nAccording to Eq. 6-12, the power delivered by the turbine P, has to be\nequal to the power required by the propellant pumps, the auxiliaries mounted on\nthe turbopump (such as hydraulic pumps, electric generators, tachometers, etc.),\nand power losses in hydraulic friction, bearings, gears, seals, and wear rings.\nUsually these losses are small and can often be neglected. The effect of the\nturbine gas flow on the specific impulse of the rocket engine system is discussed\nin Section 6.6. For gas generator engine cycles, the rocket designer is interested\nin obtaining a high turbine efficiency and a high turbine inlet temperature T; in\norder to reduce the flow of turbine working fluid, and for gas generator cycles\nalso to raise the overall effective specific impulse, and, therefore, reduce the\npropellant mass required for driving the turbine. Three-dimensional computer\nanalyses of the gas flow behavior and turbine blade geometry have resulted in\nefficient blade designs.\n\nBetter turbine blade materials (such as single crystals which have been uni-\ndirectionally solidified) and specialty alloys can allow turbine inlet temperatures\nbetween 1400 K (or about 2050\u00b0F) and perhaps 1600 K (or 2420\u00b0F); these higher\ntemperatures or higher gas enthalpies reduce the required turbine flow. Reliabil-\nity, gas temperature variations or nonuniformity, and cost considerations have\nkept actual turbine inlet temperatures at conservative values, such as 1150 to\n1250\u00b0F or about 900 to 950 K, using special steel alloys as the blade and disk\nmaterials. The efficiency of turbines for rocket turbopumps is shown in Fig. 10-9.\nMaximum blade speeds with good design and strong high-temperature materials\nare typically 400 to 700 m/sec or about 1300 to 2300 ft/sec. Higher blade speeds\ngenerally allow an improvement in efficiency. For the efficiency to be high the\nturbine blade and nozzle profiles have to have smooth surfaces. Small clearances\nat the turbine blade tips are also needed to minimize leakage around the blades.\n\nDifferent organizations define turbine efficiency in different ways. One way\nto define the turbine efficiency n, is the turbine power output LN divided by the\nturbine input from an ideal uniform heated gas flowing through an ideal turbine.\nThe gas flow can be considered the ideal isentropic enthalpy drop. The actual\npressure drop and the actual Af or usually higher than the ideal:\n\nnr = L,N,/m Ah (10-19)\nHere Ah is the enthalpy drop with isentropic gas expansion across the turbine\nnozzles and the turbine buckets or blades (moving and stationary) per unit gas\nmass flow. It is typically based on a uniform gas flow across a flow section,\nuniform gas properties across a flow section, perfect gases, no leakage or alter-\nnatively a nominal leakage around the blades, and perfect blade contours. Even a\nsmall clearance at the tip of turbine blades causes substantial losses, particularly\nat small turbine diameter and small blade heights. Some organizations include a\nfew unavoidable basic losses in defining the ideal power.\n\nThe advantage of increased turbine efficiency (less gas generator propellant\nrequirement) can be realized only if the turbopump design has efficient turbine\nblade contours and allows high blade speeds.

The power input to the turbine can\nbe regulated by controlling the gas flow and gas temperatures to the turbine inlet\nthrough valves or orifices.\n\nUsually, the preliminary analysis for the pump is done first. Avoiding exces-\nsive cavitation sets a key pump parameter, namely the maximum pump shaft\nspeed. This is the highest possible shaft speed, which in turn allows the lightest\nturbopump mass, without excessive cavitation in the pump. If excessive cavita-\ntion occurs at the leading edge of the main impeller, then the flow will become\nunsteady and variable, leading to lower thrust and possible combustion instabil-\nity. The amount of pressure in the vehicle (gas pressure in propellant tank plus\nthe static elevation pressure) that can be made available to the engine (at the\npump inlet) for suppressing cavitation has to be larger than the impeller vanes\u2019\nown pressure limit to cavitate. This allows us then to determine the shaft speed,\nwhich in turn can establish the approximate pump efficiencies, impeller tip speed\n(usually also limited by the material strength of the impeller), number of pump\nstages, key dimensions of the impeller.\n\n10.7. APPROACH TO TURBOPUMP PRELIMINARY DESIGN\n\nWith all major rocket engine components the principal criteria (high performance\nor efficiency, minimum mass, high reliability, and low cost) have to be weighted\nand prioritized for each vehicle mission. For example, high efficiency and low\nmass usually mean low design margins, and thus lower reliability. A higher\nshaft speed will allow a lower mass turbopump, but it cavitates more readily\nand requires a higher tank pressure and heavier vehicle tanks (which usually\noutweighs the mass savings in the turbopump).\n\nThe engine requirements give the initial basic design goals for the preliminary\ndesign of the turbopump, namely propellant flow, the pump outlet or discharge\npressure (which has to be equal to the chamber pressure plus the pressure drops in\nthe piping, valves, cooling jacket, and injector), the best engine cycle (as shown\nin Fig. 6\u20149), the start delay, and the need for restart or throttling, if any. Also, the\npropellant properties (density, vapor pressure, viscosity, or boiling point) must\nbe known. Some of the design criteria are explained in Refs. 10-2 and 10-3,\nand basic texts on turbines and pumps are listed as Refs. 10\u20144 to 10-8.\n\nThere are several design variations or geometrical arrangements for transmit-\nting turbine power to one or more propellant pumps; some are shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 10\u20144 and an initial selection has to be made. If there is a mismatch\nbetween the optimum pump speed and the optimum turbine speed (which is usu-\nally higher), it may save inert mass and turbine drive gas mass to interpose a gear\nreduction between their shafts. See Fig. 6-11 and Figs. 10\u20144d and 10\u20144f. For\nthe last two decades designers have preferred to use direct drive, which avoids\n",
    "409": "392 TURBOPUMPS AND THEIR GAS SUPPLIES\nthe complication of a gear case but at a penalty in efficiency and the amount of\nturbine drive propellant gas required. See Figs. 6-12, 10-1, 10-2, and 10\u20144e.\n\nThe key turbine parameter can be estimated because the power output of the\nturbine essentially has to equal the power demand of the pumps. If the pump is\ndriven directly, that is, without a gear case, then the pump speed and the tur-\nbine speed are equal. From the properties of the turbine drive gas (temperature,\nspecific heat, etc.), the strength limits of the turbine materials, and the likely\npressure drop, it is possible to determine the basic dimensions of the blades\n[pitch line velocity, turbine nozzle outlet velocity, number of rows (stages) of\nblades, turbine type, or turbine efficiency]. The particular arrangement or geom-\netry of the major turbopump components is related to their selection process.\nMost propellant pumps have a single-stage main impeller. For liquid hydrogen\nwith its low density, a two- or three-stage pump is normally needed. Usually\nsome design limit is reached which requires one or more iterations, each with a\nnew changed approach or parameter. The arrangement of the major turbopump\ncomponents (Fig. 10\u20144) is also influenced by the position of the bearings on the\nshaft. For example, we do not want to place a bearing in front of an impeller inlet\nbecause it will cause turbulence, distort the flow distribution, raise the suction\npressure requirement, and make cavitation more likely to occur. Also, bearings\npositioned close to a turbine will experience high temperatures, which influences\nthe lubrication by propellant and may demand more cooling of the bearings.\n\nThe use of booster pumps allows lower tank pressure, and thus lower inert\nvehicle mass, and provides adequate suction pressures to the main pump inlet.\nSee Ref. 10-12. Booster pumps are used in the Space Shuttle main engine and\nthe Russian RD-170, as seen in Figs. 6-12 and 11\u20142. Some booster pumps\nhave been driven by a liquid booster turbine using a small flow of high-pressure\nliquid propellant that has been tapped off the discharge side of the main pump.\nThe discharged turbine liquid then mixes with the main propellant flow at the\ndischarge of the booster pump.\n\nMass is at a premium in all flying vehicle installations, and the feed system\nis selected to have a minimum combined mass of tubines, pumps, gas generator,\nvalves, tanks, and gas generator propellants. Some of the considerations in the\ndesign of turbopumps are the thermal stresses, warpage due to thermal expansion\nor contraction, axial loads, adequate clearances to prevent rubbing yet minimize\nleakage, alignment of bearings, provisions for dynamic balancing of rotating\nparts, mounting on an elastic vehicle frame without inducing external forces, and\navoiding undue pressure loads in the liquid and gas pipes.\n\nVibrations of turbopumps have caused problems during development. The\nanalyses of the various vibrations of components (shaft, turbine blades, liquid\noscillations, gas flow oscillations, or bearing vibrations) are not given here. At the\ncritical speed the natural structural resonance frequency of the rotating assembly\n(shaft, impellers, turbine disk, etc.) coincides with the rotation operating speed,\na condition that must be minimized. A slight unbalance can then be amplified to\ncause significant shaft deflections, bearing failure, and other damage. The oper-\nating speed therefore is usually lower, but occasionally higher than the critical\n",

A large diameter stiff shaft, rigid bearings, and stiff bearing supports will\nincrease this critical speed, and damping (such as the liquid lubricant film in\nthe bearing) will reduce the vibration amplitude. The solving of various internal\nvibration problems, such as whirl in bearings and blade vibrations, is reported\nin Ref. 10-16 and the dynamics of the propellant flow in pumps in Ref. 10-15.\nVibrations of adjacent components can be excited by a TP and the natural fre-\nquency of these components can be analyzed. If the operating frequency or\nthe shaft speed of the rotating assembly coincides with the natural frequency,\nanother engine part, such as injector domes or certain piping assemblies, then an\nundesirable resonance with excessive stresses can occur. As a result the natural\nfrequencies of affected component or of the TP can be changed by design. For\nexample, whenever the tip of a pump blade goes by the tongue of the pump\nvolute, a pressure wave is generated in the liquid. The frequency is the product\nof the number of pump vanes and the speed of the vane tip. Vibrations external\nto the TP, such as those generated by a thrust chamber (see Chapter 9) should not\ninfluence the operation of a TP. This interaction, if it occurs, can be determined\nby hot fire tests of a complete engine with appropriate instruments measuring TP\nbehavior.\n\nThe bearings in most existing TPs are high precision, special metal alloy ball\nbearings (Ref. 10-13). A few are roller bearings, which have a higher radial\nload capacity. Some ball bearings can take both radial and axial loads. Early\nball and roller bearings were limited in the loads and speeds at which they\ncould operate reliably. New bearings were developed by the bearing industry. In\nsome TP designs the limits of the bearing loads and speeds determined the shaft\nspeed and thus the minimum size of the turbopump, rather than the cavitation\nlimit of the pump. Various types of bearings, and many types of seals have\nbeen explored, tested in laboratory fixtures or experimental TPs. This included\nhydrostatic (precision sleeve type) bearings, foil bearings, and magnetic bearings\n(Ref. 10-13). As far as the authors know, none of these have as yet found their\nway into a production TP. The variety of static and dynamic seals is relatively\nlarge, and the selection is strongly influenced by the preferences of the design\norganization (Ref. 10-14). One type of bearing oscillation problem is discussed\nan Ref 10-16.\n\nIf the turbopump is part of a reusable rocket engine, it becomes more complex.\nFor example, it can include provision to allow for inspection and automatic\ncondition evaluation after each mission or flight. This can include an inspection\nof bearings through access holes for boroscope instruments, checking for cracks\nin highly stressed parts (turbine blade roots or hot-gas high-pressure manifolds),\nor the measurement of shaft torques (to detect possible binding or warpage).\n\nThe number of different materials of construction of TP appears to have\nincreased. For example, for high-speed, high-load, ball bearings a new ball\nmaterial (silicon nitride) has been successfully introduced. Relatively common\nmaterials, such as stainless steels, have in part been replaced by superalloys,\nsuch as Inconel. Powder metallurgy has found its way into impellers and turbine\nparts. Although the strength is not really better than a forged or cast material,\n",

The sudden admission\nof hot gas at full flow causes severe thermal shock and thermal distortion and\nincreases the chances for rubbing between moving metal parts. The most severe\nstresses of a turbine blade often are thermal stresses; they come during the engine\nstart when the leading edge is very hot but other parts of the blade are still cold.\n\nFor low-thrust engines the shaft speeds can become very high, such as over\n100,000 rpm. Also, the turbine blade height becomes very short and friction\nlosses can become prohibitive. In order to obtain a reasonable blade height we\ngo to partial admission turbine designs. Here a portion of the turbine nozzles are\neffectively plugged or eliminated.\n\n10.8. GAS GENERATORS AND PREBURNERS\n\nThe purpose of a gas generator or a preburner is to create the \u201cwarm\u201d gas (usually\nbetween 600 and 2000\u00b0F or 315 to 1200\u00b0C) to drive the turbine of a TP. See\nRefs. 10-1 to 10-5. The selected gas temperature depends on nearly uniform\ngas composition, the engine design, the turbine blade materials, using uncooled\nhardware, and the acceptable risk of failure. In order to achieve these warm gas\ntemperatures with a bipropellant, most operate at a fuel-rich mixture ratio, but\nsome of the preburners in the Soviet Union (today Russia) operate at an oxidizer-\nrich mixture usually with engines using staged combustion engine cycles. Each\nof these combustion devices consists of a combustion chamber, an injector, and\na pipe or duct leading to the turbine. They all have separate dedicated propellant\ncontrol valves, sometimes with some calibrated orifices, for control of the flows.\nThey resemble a thrust chamber, but they do not have a single bow-tie-shaped\nsupersonic nozzle. Instead the warm gas flows subsonically from the gas generator\nor the preburner through pipes or manifolds into the nozzles of the turbine (here\nthey reach high velocities) and then they flow supersonically through the row(s)\nof turbine blades, which extract the energy for driving the propellant pumps.\nRequirements for gas generators or preburners include the delivery of warm\ngas at the intended mass flows, pressure, and design temperature, an essentially\nuniform gas temperature across the flow path to the turbine and no high gas\ntemperature spikes. Combustion instability problems are extremely rare.\n\nGas generators are used exclusively with liquid propellant rocket engines,\nwhich operate on a gas generator engine cycle, and preburners are used exclu-\nsively with rocket engines, which operate on a staged combustion cycle and they\nusually operate at a higher pressure. Table 10\u20143 explains some of the differences\nbetween these two and Table 6\u20146 and Fig. 6\u20149 describe the engine cycles.\n\nGas generators are shown as a component of an engine in Fig. 1-4 and\nRef. 10-4 and preburners in Figs. 6-1, 6-12, and 11-2. Propellants supplied\nto the gas generator or the preburner usually are tapped off from discharges of\nthe engines main pumps. When starting an engine, the turbomachinery needs to\n",

    "416": "CHAPTER 11\nSS\nThis chapter discusses the propellant budget, performance of complete or mul-\ntiple rocket propulsion systems, the design of liquid propellant rocket engines\nwith pressurized or turbopump feed systems, engine controls, engine calibration,\nsystem integration, and system optimization. Some of the content also applies to\nsolid propellant motors or hybrid propulsion systems.\n\n11.1. PROPELLANT BUDGET\n\nIn all liquid propellant rocket engines the amount of propellant put into the\nvehicle tanks is always a little greater than the nominal amount of propellant\nneeded to accomplish the intended mission. The extra propellant is needed for\nuses other than providing thrust (e.g., residual propellant or valve actuation), to\ncompensate for changes from engine to engine, such as dimensional tolerances\ncausing slight changes in flow, for uncertainties of the construction of the engine\nand minor changes in the flight plan. A propellant budget is the sum of all the\npropellant utilization categories and losses in an engine; 11 are listed below. See\nRef. 11-1. The budget helps to determine how much propellant has to be loaded.\nIt is the aim to minimize this amount of propellant.\n\n1. Enough propellant has to be available for achieving the required vehicle\nvelocity increase and/or the nominal attitude control maneuvers of the par-\nticular application and the particular flight vehicle or stage. The nominal\nvelocity increment is usually defined by systems analysis and mission opti-\nmization using an iterative calculation based on Eq. 4\u201419 or 4\u201435. If there\nare alternative flight paths or missions for the same vehicle, the mission\n\n399\n",
    "417": "400 _ENGINE SYSTEMS, CONTROLS, AND INTEGRATION\nwith an unfavorable flight path, such as higher drag or different orbit, and\nthe highest total impulse should be selected. This mission-required propel-\nlant is usually the largest portion of the total propellants loaded into the\nvehicle tanks.\n\n2. In a turbopump system using a gas generator cycle, a small portion of the\noverall propellant is burned in a separate gas generator. It has a lower\nflame temperature than the thrust chamber gas and operates at a different\nmixture ratio; this causes a slight change in the overall mixture ratio of\npropellants flowing from the tanks, as shown by Eqs. 11-3 and 11-5.\n\n3. In a rocket propulsion system with a thrust vector control (TVC) system,\nsuch as a swiveling thrust chamber or nozzle, the thrust vector will be\nrotated by a few degrees. Thrust vector control systems are described in\nChapter 18. There is a slight decrease in the axial thrust and that reduces\nthe vehicle velocity increment in item 1. The extra propellant needed to\ncompensate for the small velocity reduction can be determined from the\nmission requirements and TVC duty cycle. It could be between 0.1 and\n4% of the total propellant depending on the average angle position of this\nthrust chamber.\n\n4. In some engines a small portion of cryogenic propellants is heated, vapor-\nized, and the gas used to pressurize cryogenic propellant tanks. A heat\nexchanger is used to heat liquid oxygen from the pump discharge and pres-\nsurize the oxygen tank, as shown schematically in Fig. 1-4. This method\nis used in the hydrogen and oxygen tanks of the Space Shuttle external\ntank (see Ref. 6-9).\n\n5. Auxiliary rocket engines that provide for trajectory corrections, station\nkeeping, maneuvers, or attitude control usually have a series of small\nrestartable thrusters (see Chapter 4). The propellants for these auxiliary\nthrusters have to be included in the propellant budget if they are supplied\nfrom the same feed system and tanks as the larger rocket engine. Depend-\ning on the mission, the duty cycle, and the propulsion system concept,\nthis auxiliary propulsion system can consume a significant portion of the\navailable propellants.\n\n6. The residual propellant that clings to tank walls or remains trapped in\nvalves, pipes, injector passages, or cooling passages is unavailable for pro-\nducing thrust. It is typically 0.5 to 2% of the total propellant load. All\nunused residual propellant increases the final vehicle mass at thrust termi-\nnation and reduces the final vehicle velocity slightly.\n\n7. A loading uncertainty exists due to variations in tank volume or changes\nin propellant density or liquid level in the tank. This is typically 0.25 to\n0.75% of the total propellant. It depends, in part, on the accuracy of the\nmethod of measuring the propellant mass during loading (weighing the\nvehicle, flow meters, level gauges, etc.).\n\n8. The off-nominal rocket performance is due to variations in the manufacture\nof hardware from one engine to another (such as slightly different pressure\n",
    "418": "11.2. PERFORMANCE OF COMPLETE OR MULTIPLE ROCKET PROPULSION SYSTEMS 401\n\nlosses in a cooling jacket, in injectors and valves, or somewhat different\npump characteristics); these cause slight changes in combustion behavior,\nmixture ratio, or specific impulse. If there are slight variations in mixture\nratio, one of the two liquid propellants will be consumed fully and an\nunusable residue will remain in the other propellant\u2019s tank. If a minimum\ntotal impulse requirement has to be met, extra propellant has to be tanked to\nallow for these mixture ratio variations. This can amount to up to perhaps\n2.0% for each of the propellants.\n\n9. Operational factors can result in additional propellant requirements, such\nas filling more propellant than needed into a tank or incorrectly adjusting\nregulators or control valves. It can also include the effect of changes in\nflight acceleration from the nominal value. For an engine that has been\ncarefully calibrated and tested, this factor can be small, usually between\n0.1 and 1.0%.\n\n10. When using cryogenic propellants, an allowance for evaporation and cool-\ning down has to be included. It is the mass of extra propellant that is\nallowed to evaporate (and be vented overboard while the vehicle is waiting\nto be launched) or that is fed through the engine to cool it down, before the\nremaining propellant in the tank becomes less than the minimum needed\nfor the flight mission. Its quantity depends on the amount of time between\ntopping off (partial refilling) of the tank and the engine start.\n\n11. Finally, an overall contingency or ignorance factor is needed to allow for\nunforeseen propellant needs or inadequate or uncertain estimates of any\nof the items above. This can also include allowances for vehicle drag\nuncertainties, variations in the guidance and control system, wind, or leaks.\n\nOnly some of the items above provide axial thrust (items 1, 2, and sometimes\nalso 3 and 5), but all the items need to be considered in determining the total\npropellant mass and tank volume.\n\nThe example shown in Table 11-1 is for a spacecraft pressure-fed engine\nsystem, where the majority of the propellant is consumed in a larger axial thrust\nchamber, and the second largest amount of propellant is fed to a set of several\nsmall thrusters used for extensive attitude control maneuvers. There will be flights\nwhere the mission may be more demanding or the engine performance may be\nslightly lower, and extra propellant will be needed to accomplish the mission.\nConversely if the engine performance is actually slightly better than nominal\nor where the mission can be accomplished with less total impulse (operate with\nfewer or lower orbits), then the engine will consume less than the nominal amount\nof propellant.\n\n11.2.

ENGINE DESIGN 405\ncomponents and several engines (under various environmental and perfor-\nmance limit conditions), in order to establish credible reliability data with\nenough confidence to allow the initial flights and initial production. Since\nthe state of the art is relatively mature today, the design and development\nof a truly novel engine does not happen very often.\n\n2. New engine using some major components or somewhat modified key com-\n\nponents from proven existing engines. This is a common approach today.\nThe design of such an engine requires working within the capability and\nlimits of existing or slightly modified components. It requires less testing\nfor proving reliability.\n\n3. Uprated or improved version of an existing, proven engine. This approach\n\nis quite similar to the second. It is needed when an installed engine for\na given mission requires more payload (which really means higher thrust)\nand/or longer burning duration (more total impulse). Uprating often means\nmore propellant (larger tanks), higher propellant flows and higher chamber\nand feed pressures, and more feed system power. The engine usually has\nan increased inert engine mass (thicker walls).\n\nIn a simplified way, we describe here a typical process for designing an engine.\nChapter 19 and Refs. 11\u20145 and 11-6 describe this process and the selection of the\npropulsion system from a different point of view. At first the basic function and\nrequirements of the new engine must be established. These engine requirements\nare derived from the vehicle mission and vehicle requirements, usually deter-\nmined by the customer and/or the vehicle designers, often in cooperation with\none or more engine designers. The engine requirements can include key param-\neters such as thrust level, the desired thrust-time variation, restart or pulsing,\naltitude flight profile, duty cycle, maximum accelerations, engine locations within\nthe vehicle, and limitations or restraints on cost, engine envelope, test location, or\nschedule. It also includes some of the factors listed later in Table 19\u2014S. If an exist-\ning proven engine can be adapted to these requirements, the subsequent design\nprocess will be simpler and quite different than the design of a truly new engine.\n\nUsually some early tentative decisions about the engine are made, such as the\nselection of the propellants, their mixture ratio, or the cooling approach for the\nhot components. They are based on mission requirements, customer preferences,\npast experiences, some analysis, and the judgment of the key decision makers.\nAfter some studies additional selection decisions can also be made, such as having\none, two, or more thrust chambers fed from the same feed system, redundancy\nof auxiliary thrusters, or type of ignition system.\n\nA systematic approach, a good set of analyses, the use of system engineering,\ngood coordination with the customers, key vendors, and vehicle designers\u2014all\nare needed for a good preliminary and final design. Before a meaningful proposal\nfor an engine can be prepared, a preliminary design has to be completed. See\nRefs. 11-5 to 11-7. One of the early design decisions is the choice of feed\nsystem: pressurized gas feed or pump feed. The next two paragraphs give some\nguidelines.\n",
    "423": "406 _ENGINE SYSTEMS, CONTROLS, AND INTEGRATION\n\nA pressurized feed system (see Fig. 1-3) usually gives better vehicle perfor-\nmance for low values of total impulse (thrust less than about 4.5 kN or 1000 Ibf\nwith up to perhaps 2 min duration). A pump feed system gives better vehicle\nperformance for high thrust (say above 50,000 Ibf or approximately 222 kN) and\na long cumulative duration\u2014more than a couple of minutes. For intermediate\nvalues of total impulse the choice can go either way, and it is not easy to make\nthe decision only on the basis of total impulse. If the chamber pressure of a\npressurized feed system is relatively high (say about 2.4 to 3.5 MPa or about 350\nto 500 psia and occasionally more), then the inert weight of the thrust chamber\nwill be high, but the thrust chamber will be small and can usually fit into an\nengine compartment. The vehicle propellant tanks and pressurizing gas tank will\nbe at relatively high pressure and will be heavy. For a relatively low chamber\npressure (0.689 to 1.379 MPa or 100 to 200 psia) the vehicle tank pressure will\nbe lower and the tank walls thinner, but the thrust chamber will be very large\nin size and often will exceed the limits of the engine compartment, unless it\nhas a low nozzle area ratio, which implies lower performance. Even in some\ncases of low chamber pressure, a pressurized feed system can be heavier than\na comparable engine with a pump feed system. Pressurized feed systems have\nbeen relatively simple, very reliable, and they allow fast starts and fast restarts.\nWith restarts the cooling of the thrust chamber can become a problem. Because\nof the proven reliability of pressure feed system, NASA has at times conser-\nvatively selected pressurized feed systems for certain space applications, such\nas the Apollo service module engine (21,900 lbf thrust), even though there is a\nmajor weight penalty and a somewhat inferior vehicle performance compared to\na pump-fed system of equal total impulse. Also a decision has to be made on\nusing either a pressurized system with a gas pressure regulator or alternatively a\nblow-down system. See Table 6\u20143 and Section 6.4.\n\nFor a turbopump-fed liquid propellant rocket engine (see Fig. 1\u20144) the overall\ninert weight of propellant tanks and engine will be considerably lighter and\nusually the vehicle performance will be somewhat better. It usually operates\nat high chamber pressures (3.5 to 24.1 MPa or about 500 to 3500 psia), the\nthrust chamber is not normally protruding from the vehicle. The smaller and\nshorter thrust chamber often allows a shortening of the vehicle with a savings\nin vehicle structure. This further improves the vehicle\u2019s performance modestly\nand the higher specific impulse will slightly reduce the amount of propellant\nneeded for the mission. Compared to an engine with a pressurized feed system,\nthe savings in inert mass (thin vehicle tank walls) and less propellant will allow\na smaller, lighter, and probably lower cost vehicle with a somewhat superior\nperformance. The engine with a TP is more complex with more parts and the\nengine will generally be heavier; however, the vehicles propellant and gas tanks\nwill be much lighter and they will more than compensate for the heavier engine.\nIt will take more tests and more effort to prove high reliability in an engine with\na pump feed system. At the higher chamber pressures the heat transfer will be\nhigher and cooling can become a problem, but heat transfer has been solved in\nother earlier high-pressure rocket engines. Also restart will be more complex. One\n",

High reliability has been achieved in\nmany turbopump-fed large rocket engines.\n\nTrade-off studies between several options are appropriate at this time. With a\nmodified existing engine these parameters are well established and require fewer\ntrade-off studies or analyses. Initial analyses of the pressure balances, power\ndistribution between pumps and turbines, gas generator flow, propellant flows\nand reserves, or the maximum cooling capacity are appropriate. Sketches and\npreliminary estimates of inert mass of key components need to be made, such as\ntanks, thrust chambers, turbopumps, feed and pressurization systems, thrust vector\ncontrol, or support structure. Alternate arrangements of components (layouts) are\nusually examined, often to get the most compact configuration or control of the\ntravel of the center of gravity. An initial evaluation of combustion stability, stress\nanalysis of critical components, water hammer, engine performance at some off-\ndesign conditions, safety features, testing requirements, cost, and schedule are\noften performed at this time. Participation of appropriate experts from the field of\nmanufacturing, field service, materials, stress analysis, or safety can be critical for\nselecting the proper engine and the key design features. A design review is usually\nconducted on the selected engine design and the rationale for new or key features.\n\nTest results of subscale or full-scale components, or related or experimental\nengines, will have a strong influence on this design process. The key engine\nselection decisions need to be validated later in the development process by\ntesting new components and new engines.\n\nThe inert mass of the engine and other mass properties (center of gravity\nor moment of inertia) are key parameters of interest to the vehicle designer or\ncustomer. They are needed during preliminary design and again, in more detail,\nin the final design. The engine mass is usually determined by summing up the\ncomponent or subsystem masses, each of which is either weighed or estimated by\ncalculating their volumes and knowing their densities. Sometimes early estimates\nare based on known similar parts or subassemblies.\n\nPreliminary engine performance estimates are often based on data from prior\nsimilar engines. If these are not available, then theoretical performance values\ncan be calculated (see Chapters 2, 3, and 5) for F, J;, k, or 0, using appropriate\nestablished correction factors. Measured static test data are, of course, better than\nestimates. The final performance values are obtained from flight tests or simulated\naltitude tests, where airflow and altitude effects can interact with the vehicle or\nthe plume.\n\nIf the preliminary design does not meet the engine requirements, then changes\nneed to be made to the initial engine decisions and, if that is not sufficient,\nsometimes also to the mission requirements themselves. Components, pressure\nbalances, and so forth will be reanalyzed, and the results will be a modified ver-\nsion of the engine configuration, its inert mass, and performance. This process is\niterated until the requirements are met and a suitable engine has been found. The\ninitial design effort culminates in preliminary layouts of the engine, a prelimi-\nnary inert mass estimate, an estimated engine performance, a cost estimate, and\na tentative schedule. These preliminary design data form the basis for a written\n",

They are described further in Section 11.6. We optimize\nparameters such as chamber pressure, nozzle area ratio, thrust, mixture ratio, or\nnumber of large thrust chambers supplied by the same turbopump. The results\nof optimization studies indicate the best parameter, which will give a further,\nusually small, improvement in vehicle performance, propellant fraction, engine\nvolume, or cost.\n\nOnce the engine proposal has been favorably evaluated by the vehicle design-\ners, and after the customer has provided authorization and funding to proceed,\nthen the final design can begin. Some of the analyses, layouts, and estimates will\nbe repeated, but in more detail, specifications and manufacturing documents will\nbe written, vendors will be selected, and tooling will be built. The selection of\nsome of the key parameters (particularly those associated with some technical\nrisk) will need to be validated. After another design review, key components and\nprototype engines are built and ground tested as part of a planned development\neffort. If proven reliable, one or two sets of engines will be installed in a vehicle\nand operated during flight. In those programs where a fair number of vehicles\nare to be built, the engine will then be produced in the required quantity.\n\nTable 11-3 shows some of the characteristics of three different Russian\ncombustion cycle engine designs, each at a different thrust and with different\npropellants (from Ref. 11-8). It shows primary engine parameters (chamber pres-\nsure, thrust, specific impulse, weight, propellant combination, nozzle area ratio,\ndimensions, etc.) which influence the vehicle performance and configuration. It\nalso shows secondary parameters, which are internal to the engine but important\nin component design and engine optimization. The Space Shuttle main engine\n(see Figs. 6-1 and 6-12) has two fuel-rich preburners, but the Russian staged\ncombustion engines use oxidizer-rich preburners. Figure 11\u20141 shows the RD-170\nengine with four thrust chambers (and their thrust vector actuators) supplied by\na centrally located single large turbopump (257,000 hp; not visible in the photo)\nand one of the two oxidizer-rich preburners. Figures 11\u20141 and 11-2 show this\nturbopump and the two booster turbopumps; one is driven by a turbine using a\nbleed of oxygen-rich gas from the turbine exhaust (the gas is condensed when\nit mixes with the liquid oxygen flow) and the other by a liquid turbine using\nhigh-pressure liquid fuel. A version of this RD-170 rocket engine is used in the\nfirst stage of the U.S. Atlas V space launch vehicle.\n\nMuch of today\u2019s engine design, preliminary design, and design optimization\ncan be performed with computer programs. These include finite element anal-\nyses, codes for stress and heat transfer, weight and mass properties, stress and\nstrain analysis of a variety of structures, water hammer, engine performance\nanalyses, feed system analyses (for balance of flow, pressures, and power),\ngas pressurization, combustion vibrations, and various exhaust plume effects\n(Refs. 11-4 and 11-5 are examples of performance analyses).

With cryogenic propellants the pipes, pumps, cooling jackets, injectors, and\nvalves have to be cooled to the cryogenic fluid temperature prior to start,\nby bleeding cold propellant through them; this cooling propellant is not\nused to produce thrust. Its periodic flow has to be controlled.\n\n9. Check out proper functioning of critical components or a group of compo-\nnents without actual hot operation before and/or after flight.\n\n10. For recoverable or reusable rocket engines, and for engines use in ground\ndevelopment tests also provide features to perform checks and recycle the\nengine to a ready condition.\n\nThe complexity of these control elements and the complexity of the engine\nsystems depend very much on the mission of the vehicle. In general, rockets\nthat are used only once (single-shot devices), that are filled with propellants\nat the factory, that operate at nearly constant propellant flow, and that have\nto operate over a narrow range of environmental conditions tend to be simpler\nthan rocket systems intended for repeated use, for applications where satisfactory\noperation must be demonstrated prior to use, and for manned vehicles. Because\nof the nature of the liquid propellants, most of the control actuation functions\nare achieved by valves, regulators, pressure switches, valve position indicators,\ncalibrated orifices, or flow controls. The use of special computers for automatic\ncontrol in large engines is now common. The flow control devices, namely the\nvalves, were discussed in Section 6.9 and the controls are discussed in this section.\n\nSafety controls are intended to protect personnel and equipment in case of\nmalfunction. This applies mostly to development engines during ground tests,\nbut if can also be applied to certain flight test engines and to certain operating\nengine. For example, the control system is usually so designed that a failure of\nthe electrical power supply to the rocket causes a nonhazardous shutdown (all\nelectrical valves automatically returning to their normal position) and no mixing\nor explosion of unreacted propellant can occur. Another example is an electrical\ninterlock device which prevents the opening of the main propellant valves until\nthe igniter has functioned properly.\n\nCheck-out controls permit a simulation of the operation of critical control\ncomponents without actual hot operation of the rocket unit.

The starting and stopping of a rocket engine can be very critical in\ntiming, valve sequencing, and transient characteristics. A good control system\nmust be designed to avoid undesirable transient operation. Close control of the\nflow of propellant, of the pressure, and of the mixture ratio is necessary to obtain\nreliable and repeatable safe rocket performance. The starting and ignition of thrust\nchambers has been discussed in Section 8.6.\n\nFortunately, most rocket units operate with a nearly constant propellant con-\nsumption and a constant mixture ratio, which simplifies the operating control\nproblem. Stable operation of liquid propellant flows can be accomplished with-\nout automatic control devices because the liquid flow system in general tends to\nbe inherently stable. This means that the hydraulic system reacts to any distur-\nbance in the flow of propellant (a sudden flow increase or decrease) in such a\nmanner as to reduce the effect of the disturbance. The system, therefore, usually\nhas a natural tendency to control itself. However, in some cases the natural res-\nonances of the system and its components can have frequency values that tend\nto destabilize the system.\n\nThe start delay time for a pressure feed system is usually small. Prior to start,\nthe pressurization system has to be activated and the ullage volume has to be\npressurized. This start delay is the time to purge the system if needed, open\nvalves, initiate combustion, and raise the flow and chamber pressure to rated\nvalues. A turbopump system usually requires more time to start. In addition to\nthe foregoing starting steps for a pressurized system, it has to allow a time period\nfor starting a gas generator or preburner and for bringing the turbopumps up to a\nspeed at which combustion can be sustained and thereafter up to full flow. If the\npropellant is nonhypergolic, additional time has to be allowed for the igniter to\nfunction and for feedback to confirm that it is working properly. All these events\nneed to be controlled. Table 11\u20144 describes many of these typical steps, but not\nall of them are in every engine.\n\nStarting of small thrusters with a pressurized feed system can be very fast, as\nshort as 3 to 15 msec, enough time for a small valve to open, the propellant to\nflow to the chamber and to ignite, and the small chamber volume to be filled with\nhigh-pressure combustion gas. In an engine with a pressurized feed system the\ninitial flow of each propellant is often considerably higher than the rated flow at\nfull thrust, because the pressure differential (Ptank \u2014 p1) is so much higher with\n",

In many cases\nseveral successive purges are undertaken.\n\nWith cryogenic propellants the piping system needs to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to\nprevent vapor pockets. This is done by repeated bleeding of cold propellant through the engine\nsystem (valves, pumps, pipes, injectors, etc.) just prior to start. The vented cold gas condenses\nmoisture droplets in the air and this looks like heavy billowing clouds escaping from the engine.\n\nRefill or \u201ctop off\u2019 tank to replace cryogenic propellant that has evaporated or been used for cooling\nthe engine.\n\nPressurize vehicle\u2019s propellant tanks just before start.\n\n2. Start: Preliminary Operation\n\nProvide start electric signal, usually from vehicle control unit or test operator.\n\nWith nonhypergolic propellants, start the ignition systems in gas generator or preburner and main\nchambers; for nonhypergolic propellants a signal has to be received that the igniter is burning\nbefore propellants are allowed to flow into the chambers.\n\nInitial operation: opening of valves (in some cases only partial opening or a bypass) to admit fuel\nand oxidizer at low initial flows to the high-pressure piping, cooling jacket, injector manifold,\nand combustion chamber(s). Valve opening rate and sequencing may be critical to achieve\nproper propellant lead. Propellants start to burn and turbine shaft begins to rotate.\n\nUsing an automated engine control, make checks (e.g., shaft speed, igniter function, feed pressures)\nto assure proper operation before initiating next step.\n\nIn systems with gearboxes the gear lubricant and coolant fluid start to flow.\n\nFor safety reasons, one of the propellants must reach the chamber first.\n\n3.

The main valves are closed, often by spring\nforces, as the fluid pressures diminish. Tank pressurization may also be stopped.

These higher propellant\nflows can lead to accumulating propellant in the chamber and can lead what has\nbeen called a \u201chard start\u201d with an initial surge of chamber pressure. In some\ncases this surge has damaged chambers. One solution has been to open the main\npropellant valves slowly or build a throttling mechanism into the valves.\n\nFor turbopump-fed systems and larger thrust engines, the time from start signal\nto full chamber pressure is longer, about 1 to 5 sec, because the pump rotors have\ninertia, the igniter flame has to heat a relatively large mass of initial propellants,\nthe propellant line volumes to be filled are large, and the number of events or\nsteps that need to take place is larger.\n\nLarge turbopump-fed rocket engines have been started in at least four ways:\n\n1. A solid propellant start grain or start cartridge is used to pressurize the\ngas generator or preburner, and this starts turbine operations. This method\nwas used on Titan III hypergolic propellant rocket engines (first and second\nstages) and on the H-1 (nonhypergolic), where the start grain flame also\nignites the liquid propellants in the gas generator. This is usually the fastest\nstart method, but it does not normally provide for a restart.\n\n2. This method, known as tank head start, is used on the SSME, is slower,\ndoes not require a start cartridge, and permits engine restart. The head of\nliquid from the vehicle tanks (usually in vertically launched large vehicles)\nplus the tank pressure cause a small initial flow of propellants; then slowly\nmore pressure is built up as the turbine begins to operate and in a couple\nof seconds the engine \u201cbootstraps\u201d its flows and the pressures then rise to\ntheir rated values.\n\n3. Asmall auxiliary pressurized propellant feed system with its own propellant\ntanks is used to feed the initial quantity of fuel and oxidizer (at essentially\nfull pressure) to the thrust chamber and gas generator. This method was\nused on one version of the RS-27 engine in the first stage of a Delta II\nspace launch vehicle.\n\n4. The spinner start method uses clean high-pressure gas from a separate\ntank to spin the turbine (usually at less than full speed) until the engine\nprovides enough hot gas to drive the turbine. The high-pressure tank is\nheavy, the connections add complexity, and it is used on the RS-68. In\nbooster engines, the tank can be part of the ground equipment.\n\nSSME Start and Stop Sequences. This is an example of the transient start\nand stop behavior of the SSME a complex staged combustion cycle engine with\na tank head start. It illustrates the rapid functions of an electronic controller.

    "435": "418 ENGINE SYSTEMS, CONTROLS, AND INTEGRATION\n\nconsisting of four pumps, two preburners, and a main combustion chamber\n(MCC) results in a complicated and sophisticated start sequence, which is very\nrobust and reliable. Prior to the start, the SSME turbopumps and ducting (down\nto the main propellant valves) are chilled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxy-\ngen (LOX) to cryogenic temperature to ensure liquid propellants for proper pump\noperation. At engine start command, the main fuel valve (MFV) is opened first to\nprovide chilling below the MFV and a fuel lead to the engine. The three oxidizer\nvalves sequence the main events during the crucial first 2 sec of start. The fuel\npreburner oxidizer valve (FPOV) is ramped to 56% to provide LOX for igni-\ntion in the fuel preburner (FPB) in order to provide initial turbine torque of the\nhigh-pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP). Fuel system oscillations (FSO), which\noccur due to heat transfer downstream of the initially chilled system, can result\nin flow rate dips. These fuel flow dips can lead to damaging temperature spikes\nin the FPB as well as the oxidizer preburner (OPB) at ignition and 2 Hz cycles\nthereafter until the hydrogen is above critical pressure. The oxidizer preburner\noxidizer valve (OPOV) and main oxidizer valve (MOV) are ramped open next\nto provide LOX for OPB and MCC ignition.\n\nThe next key event is FPB prime. Priming is filling of the LOX system\nupstream of the injectors with liquid propellant. This results in increased combus-\ntion and higher power. This event occurs around 1.4 sec into start. The HPFTP\nspeed is automatically checked at 1.24 sec into start to ensure it will be at a\nhigh enough level before the next key event, MCC prime, which is controlled\nby the MOV. Priming and valve timing are critical. We explain some of the\nevents that could go wrong. At MCC prime, an abrupt rise in backpressure on\nthe fuel pump/turbine occurs. If flow rate through the fuel pump at this time is\nnot high enough (high speed), then the heat imparted to the fluid as it is being\npumped can vaporize it, leading to unsatisfactory flow in the engine, and subse-\nquent high mixture ratio with high gas temperature and possible burnout in the\nhot gas system. This occurs if the MCC primes too early or HPFTP speed is\nabnormally low. If the MCC primes too late, the HPFTP may accelerate too fast\ndue to low backpressure after FPB prime and exceed its safe speed. The MCC\nprime normally occurs at 1.5 sec. The OPB is primed last since it controls LOX\nflow and a strong fuel lead and healthy fuel pump flow are desirable to prevent\nengine burnout due to a high mixture ratio. The OPOV provides minimal flow\nrate during the early part of the start to force the oxidizer to prime last at 1.6 sec\ninto start. Again, the FSO influences temperature spikes in the OPB and must\nbe sequenced around, prior to the MCC prime which raises the fuel pressure\nabove critical in the fuel system. At 2 sec into start, the propellant valves are\nsequenced to provide 25% of rated power level (RPL). During the first 2.4 sec of\nstart, the engine is in an open-loop mode, but proportional control of the OPOV\nis used, based on MCC pressure. At this point, additional checks are carried out\nto ensure engine health, and a subsequent ramp to mainstage at 2.4 sec is done\nusing closed-loop MCC-chamber-pressure/OPOV control. At 3.6 sec, closed-loop\nmixture ratio/FPOV control is activated.\n",
    "436": "11.4. ENGINE CONTROLS 419\n\nThe chamber cooling valve (CCV) is open at engine start and sequenced to\nprovide optimum coolant fuel flow to the nozzle cooling jacket and the chamber\nand preburners during the ignition and main stage operation. It diverts flow to\nthe cooling passages in the nozzle after MCC prime causes the heat load to\nincrease. The description above is simplified and does not mention several other\nautomatic checks, such as verifying ignition in the MCC or FPB or the fuel or\nchamber pressure buildup, which are sensed and acted upon at various times\nduring the start sequence. The spark-activated igniters are built into the three\ninjectors (MCC, FPB, OPB) using the same propellants. They are not mentioned\nabove or shown in the flow sheet, but one of them can be seen in Fig. 9-6.\n\nThe shutdown sequence is initiated by closing the OPOV, which powers down\nthe engine (reduces oxygen flow, chamber pressure, and thrust); this is followed\nquickly by closing the FPOV, so the burning will shut down fuel rich. Shortly\nthereafter the MOV is closed. The MFV stays open for a brief time and then is\nmoved into an intermediate level to balance with the oxygen flow (from trapped\noxygen downstream of the valves). The MPV and the CCV are closed after the\nmain oxygen mass has been evaporated or expelled.\n\nAutomatic Controls\n\nAutomatically monitored controls are frequently used in liquid propellant rockets\nto accomplish thrust control or mixture ratio control. The automatic control of\nthe thrust vector is discussed in Chapter 18.\n\nBefore electronic controls became common for large engines, pneumatic con-\ntrols were used with helium gas. We still use helium to actuate large valves, but\nno longer for logic control. A pressure ladder sequence control was used, where\npressures (and a few other quantities) were sensed and, if satisfactory, the next\nstep of the start sequence was pneumatically initiated. This was used on the H-1\nengine and the Russian RD-170 engine, shown in Figs. 11-1 and 11-2.\n\nMost automatic controls use a servomechanism. They generally consist of\nthree basic elements: a sensing mechanism, which measures or senses the vari-\nable quantity to be controlled; a computing or controlling mechanism, which\ncompares the output of the sensing mechanism with a reference value and gives\na control signal to the third component, the actuating device, which manipulates\nthe variable to be controlled. Additional discussion of computer control with\nautomatic data recording and analysis is given in Chapter 21.\n\nFigure 11\u20144 shows a typical simple thrust control system for a gas generator\ncycle aimed at regulating the chamber pressure (and therefore also the thrust)\nduring the flight to a predetermined value. A pressure-measuring device with\nan electric output is used for the sensing element, and an automatic control\ndevice compares this gauge output signal with a signal from the reference gauge\nor a computer voltage and thus computes an error signal. This error signal is\namplified, modulated, and fed to the actuator of the throttle valve. By controlling\nthe propellant flow to the gas generator, the generator pressure is regulated and,\ntherefore, also the pump speed and the main propellant flow; indirectly, the\n",

In this\ndiagram the mixture of the gas generator is controlled by the pintle shapes of\nthe fuel and oxidizer valves of the gas generator and by yoking these two valves\ntogether and having them moved in unison by a single actuator.\n\nIn the expander cycle shown schematically in Fig. 6-11, the thrust is regu-\nlated by maintaining a desired chamber pressure and controlling the amount of\nhydrogen gas flowing to the turbine by means of a variable bypass. The flow\nthrough this bypass is small (typically 5% of gas flow) and is controlled by the\nmovement of a control valve.\n\nIn a propellant utilization system the mixture ratio is varied to ensure that\nthe fuel and oxidizer propellant tanks are both simultaneously and completely\nemptied; no undue propellant residue should remain to increase the empty mass\nof the vehicle, which in turn would detrimentally decrease the vehicle mass\nratio and the vehicle\u2019s flight performance (see Chapter 4). For example, the\n",

ENGINE CONTROLS 421\noxidizer flow rate may be somewhat larger than normal due to its being slightly\ndenser than normal or due to a lower than normal injector pressure drop; if\nuncontrolled, a fuel residue would remain at the time of oxidizer exhaustion;\nhowever, the control system would cause the engine to operate for a period at a\npropellant mixture ratio slightly more fuel-rich than normal, to compensate and\nassure almost simultaneous emptying of both propellant tanks. Such a control\nsystem requires accurate measurement of the amount of propellant remaining in\nthe two propellant tanks during the flight.\n\nAny of the three principal components of an automatic control system can\nhave several different forms. Typical sensing devices include those that measure\nchamber pressure, propellant pressures, pump rotational speeds, tank level, or pro-\npellant flow. The actuating device can throttle propellant flow or control a bypass\ndevice or the gas generator discharge. There are many operating mechanisms for\nthe controller, such as direct electrical devices, electronic analog or digital com-\nputers, hydraulic or pneumatic devices, and mechanical devices. The actuators\ncan be driven by electrical motors or hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical power.\nThe hydraulic actuators can provide very high forces and quick response. The\nexact type of component, the nature of the power supply, the control logic, the\nsystem type, and the operating mechanisms for the specific control depend on\nthe details of the application and the requirements. Controls are discussed further\nin Refs. 11-5 and 11-9.\n\nIn applications where the final vehicle velocity must be accurately determined,\nthe amount of impulse that is imparted to the vehicle during the cutoff transient\nmay be sufficiently variable to exceed the desired velocity tolerance. Therefore,\nin these applications close control over the thrust decay curve is necessary, and\nthis can be accomplished by automatic control over the sequencing and closing\nrates of the main propellant valves and the location of the valves in relation to\nthe injector.\n\nControl by Computer\n\nEarly rocket engines used simple timers and, later, a pressure ladder sequence to\nsend commands to the engine for actuating valves and other steps in the operation.\nPneumatic controllers were also used in some engines for starting and stopping.\nFor the last 30 years we have used digital computers in large liquid propellant\nrocket engines for controlling their operation. In addition to controlling the start\nand stop of engines, they can do a lot more and can contribute to making the\nengine more reliable. Table 11-5 gives a list of typical functions that a modern\nengine control computer has undertaken in one or more engines. This list covers\nprimarily large turbopump-fed engines and does not include consideration of\nmultiple small thruster attitude control rocket engines.\n\nThe design of control computers is beyond this text. In general it has to\nconsider carefully all the possible engine requirements, all the functions that have\nto be monitored, all the likely potential failure modes and their compensating or\nameliorating steps, all the sensed parameters and their scales, the method of\n",

Sample the signals from significant sensors (e.g., chamber pressure, gas and hardware\ntemperatures, tank pressure, valve position, etc.) at frequent intervals, say once, 10, 100, or 1000\ntimes per second. For parameters that change slowly, e.g., the temperature of the control box,\nsampling every second or every 5 sec may be adequate, but chamber pressure would be sampled at\na high frequency.\n\n2. Keep a record of all the significant signals received and all the signals generated by the computer\nand sent out as commands or information. Old records have at times been very important.\n\n3. Control and verify the steps and sequence of the engine start. Figure 11-3, and Table 11-4 list\ntypical steps that have to be taken, but do not list the measured parameters that will confirm that\nthe commanded step was implemented. For example, if the igniter is activated, a signal change\nfrom a properly located temperature sensor or a radiation sensor could verify that the ignition had\nindeed happened.\n\n4. Control the shutdown of the engine. For each of the steps listed at the bottom of Table 11-4 or\nin Fig. 11-3 there often has to be a sensing of a pressure change or other parameter change to\nverify that the commanded shutdown step was taken. An emergency shutdown may be commanded\nby the controller, when it senses certain kinds of malfunctions, that allow the engine to be shut\ndown safely before a dramatic failure occurs. This emergency shutdown procedure must be done\nquickly and safely and may be different from a normal shutdown, and must avoid creating a new\nhazardous condition.\n\n5. Limit the duration of full thrust operation. For example, cutoff is to be initiated just before the\nvehicle attains the desired mission flight velocity.\n\n6. Safety monitoring and control. Detect combustion instability, overtemperatures in\nprecombustors, gas generators, or turbopump bearings, violent turbopump vibration, turbopump\noverspeed, or other parameter known to cause rapid and drastic component malfunction, that can\nquickly lead to engine failure. Usually, more than one sensor signal will show such a malfunction.\nIf detected by several sensors, the computer may identify it as a possible failure whose in-flight\nremedy is well known (and preprogrammed into the computer); then a corrective action or a safe\nshutdown may be automatically commanded by the control computer. This applies mostly to\ndevelopment engines during ground tests.\n\n7. Analyze key sensor signals for deviation from nominal performance before, during, and after\nengine operation. Determine whether sensed quantities are outside of predicted limits. If\nappropriate and feasible, if more than one sensor indicates a possible out-of-limit value, and if the\ncause and remedy can be predicted (preprogrammed), then the computer can automatically initiate\na compensating action. Parts of or combinations of items 6 and 7 have been called engine health\nmonitoring systems. They are discussed in Section 11.5.\n\n8. Control propellant tank pressurization. The tank pressure value has to be within an allowable\nrange during engine operation and also during a coasting flight period prior to a restart.

While the number of functions performed by the\ncontrol computer seems to have increased in the last 30 years, the size and mass\nof the control computer has actually decreased.\n\nThe control computer is usually packaged in a waterproof, shockproof black\nbox, which is mounted on the engine. Fire-resistant and waterproof cable har-\nnesses lead from this box to all the instrument sensors, valve position indicators,\ntachometers, accelerometers, actuators, and other engine components, to the\npower supply, the vehicle\u2019s controller, and an umbilical, severable multiwire\nharness leads to the ground support equipment. Reference 11-10 describes the\ncontroller for the Space Shuttle Main Engine.\n\n11.5. ENGINE SYSTEM CALIBRATION\n\nAlthough an engine has been designed to deliver a specific performance (F,\n1;,m, r), a newly manufactured engine will not usually perform precisely at\nthese nominal parameters. The calibration process provides the corrections to the\nengine system, so it will perform of the rated intended operating conditions. If the\ndeviation from the nominal performance values is more than a few percent, the\nvehicle will probably not complete its intended flight course. There are several\nreasons for these deviations. Because of unavoidable dimensional tolerances on\nthe hardware, the flow\u2014pressure time profile or the injector impingement (com-\nbustion efficiency) will deviate slightly from the nominal design value. Even a\nsmall change in mixture ratio will cause a significant increase of residual, unused\npropellant. Also, minor changes in propellant composition or storage tempera-\nture (which affects density and viscosity) can cause deviations. Regulator setting\ntolerances or changes in flight acceleration (which affects static head) are other\nfactors. An engine calibration is the process of adjusting some of its internal\nparameters so that it will deliver the intended performance within the allowed\ntolerance bands. See Refs. 11\u20145 and 11-6.\n\nHydraulic and pneumatic components (valves, pipes, expansion joints) can\nreadily be water flow tested on flow benches and corrected for pressure drops\nand density (and sometimes also viscosity) to determine their pressure drop at\nrated flow. Components that operate at elevated temperatures (thrust chambers,\nturbines, preburners, etc.) have to be hot fired and cryogenic components (pumps,\nsome valves) often have to be tested at the cryogenic propellant temperature. The\nengine characteristics can be estimated by adding together the corrected values of\npressure drops at the desired mass flow. Furthermore, the ratio of the rated flows\n\u2122,/mg has to equal the desired mixture ratio r. This is shown in the example\n",
    "441": "424 ENGINE SYSTEMS, CONTROLS, AND INTEGRATION\nbelow. The adjustments include adding pressure drops with judiciously placed\norifices or changing valve positions or regulator setting.\n\nIn most pressurized feed systems the pressurizing gas is supplied from its high-\npressure tank through a regulator to pressurize both the fuel and the oxidizer in\ntheir respective tanks. The pressure drop equations for the oxidizer and the fuel\n(subscripts o and f) are given below for a pressurized feed system at nominal\nflows:\n\nPeas \u2014 (APgas)\u00a2 = Pi + Avy + (APing)p + (Arye + 40ru7 \u2014 Lapp (11-6)\n\nPeas \u2014 (APgas)o = Pi + Apo + (APinj)o + 300U2 \u2014 Lapy (11-7)\n\nThe gas pressure in the propellant tank is the regulated pressure pgs, dimin-\nished by the pressure losses in the gasline Apgas. If includes the pressure drop\nacross a pressure regulator. The static head of the liquid Lap (L is the distance\nof the liquid level above the thrust chamber, a is the flight acceleration, and p\nis the propellant density) augments the gas pressure. It has to equal the chamber\npressure p; plus all the pressure drops in the liquid piping or valves Ap;, or Apo\nthe injector Apjnj, and the cooling jacket Apr, or Ap, and the dynamic flow head\nhpv. If the required liquid pressures (right-hand side of Eq. 11-6 and 11-7.)\ndo not equal the gas pressure in the propellant tank at the nominal propellant\nflow (left hand side of equations), then an additional pressure drop (calibration\norifice) has to be inserted. A good design provides an extra pressure drop margin\nfor this purpose.\n\nTwo methods are available for precise control of the engine performance\nparameters. One uses an automatic system with feedback and a digital com-\nputer to control the deviations in real time. The other relies on an initial static\ncalibration of the engine system. The latter appoach is simpler and is sometimes\npreferred, and is still quite accurate.\n\nThe pressure balance is the process of balancing the available pressure sup-\nplied to the engine (by pumps, the static head, and/or pressurized tanks) against\nthe liquid pressure drops plus the chamber pressure. It is necessary to do this\nbalancing in order to calibrate the engine, so it will operate at the desired flows\nand mixture ratio. Figure 11-5 shows the pressure balance for one of the two\nbranches of the propellant systems in a bipropellant engine with a pressurized\nfeed system. It plots the pressure drops (for injector, cooling jacket passages,\npressurizing gas passages, valves, propellant feed lines, etc.) and the chamber\npressure against the propellant flow, using actual component pressure drop mea-\nsurements (or estimated data) and correcting them for different flows. The curves\nare generally plotted in terms of head loss and volumetric flow to eliminate the\nfluid density as an explicit variable for a particular regulated pressure. The regu-\nlated pressure is usually the same for the fuel and oxidizer pressure balance and\nit also can be adjusted. This balance of head (the term head is defined in Section\n10.5) and flow must be made for both the fuel and oxidizer systems because the\nratio of their flows establishes the actual mixture ratio and the sum of their flows\nestablishes the thrust.

However, with high acceleration and dense propellants, it\ncan be a significant addition to the available head.\n\nFor a pumped feed system of a bipropellant engine, Fig. 11-6 shows a bal-\nance diagram for one branch of the two propellant systems. The pump speed is\nan additional variable. The calibration procedure is usually more complex for a\nturbopump system because the pump calibration curves (flow-head-power rela-\ntion) cannot readily be estimated without good test data and cannot easily be\napproximated by simple analytical relations. The flow of the propellants to a gas\ngenerator or preburner also needs to be calibrated. In this case the turbine shaft\ntorque has to equal the torque required by the pumps and the losses in bearings,\nseals, or windage. Thus a power balance must be achieved in addition to the\nmatching of pressures and the individual propellant flows. Since these parame-\nters are interdependent, the determination of the calibration adjustments may not\nalways be simple. Many rocket organizations have developed computer programs\nto carry out this balancing.\n",

Chamber pressure is increased by liquid column.\nExample 11-2. This example shows one way for converting componenet test data into\nnominal engine data. The following component data and design requirements are given for\na pressurized liquid propellant rocket system similar to that in Figs. 1-3 and 11-5: fuel,\n75% ethyl alcohol; oxidizer, liquid oxygen; desired mixture ratio, 1.30; desired thrust, 500\nIbf at sea level. For this propellant combustion gas k = 1.22. The propellant temperatures\nare 70\u00b0F for the alcohol fuel and the boiling point (90\u00b0K or 162\u00b0R) for the liquid oxygen.\nAssume they do not vary during operation or from run to run. The nozzle throat to exit\narea ratio is 4.0. Assume a nominal chamber pressure of 300 psia, but correct it later.\nComponent test data: Pressure losses in gas systems including the pressure regulator\nwere found to be 8.0 psi average for the operating duration at rated propellant flow. Fuel\nvalve and fuel line losses were 9.15 psi at a flow of 0.963 lbm/sec of water. Oxidizer valve\nand line losses were 14.2 psi at a flow of 1.28 lbm/sec of liquid oxygen. Fuel cooling jacket\npressure loss was 35.0 psi at a flow of 0.961 Ibm/sec of water. Oxidizer injector pressure\ndrop was 35.0 psi at 1.40 Ib/sec of oxygen flow under thrust chamber operating conditions\nbut without fuel or combustion. Fuel injector pressure drop was 40.0 psi at 1.02 Ib/sec\nof fuel flow under thrust chamber operating conditions, but without combustion. Average\nmeasured results of several sea-level actual hot thrust chamber tests were: thrust = 541\nIbf; mixture ratio = 1.29; specific impulse = 222 sec; and chamber pressure = 328 psia.\nDetermine sea level regulator setting and size and location of calibration orifices.\nSOLUTION. First, the corrections necessary to obtain the desired thrust chamber condi-\ntions have to be determined. The experimental thrust chamber data must be adjusted for\ndeviations in mixture ratio, thrust, and specific impulse. The variation of specific impulse\nwith mixture ratio is determined from experimental data or (on a relative basis) from the-\noretical calculations similar to those that are the basis of Fig. 5\u20141. Because the value of /,\nat the desired mixture ratio of 1.30 is within 0.08% of the value of J, under the actual test\nconditions (r = 1.29), any mixture ratio correction of J, is very small and neglected here.\nOne has to add the head of the liquid column (between the liquid level in the propellant\ntank and the inlet of the thrust chamber). It is a maximum at the beginning of the flight and\ndecreases as propellant is consumed. For small engine this head can can often be small, if\n",
    "444": "11.5. ENGINE SYSTEM CALIBRATION 427\nthe propellant tanks are close to the thrust chamber. We assume an average head of about\n2.5 ft or 0.92 psi of fuel and about 4.0 ft or approximately 2.0 psi of liquid oxygen.\n\nThe correction of the specific impulse for chamber pressure is made next. The spe-\ncific impulse is essentially proportional to the thrust coefficients as determined from Eq.\n3-30. For k = 1.22, the actual measured pressure ratios p;/p3 = 328/14.7 = 22.2, and\nthe nominal value 300/14.7 = 20.4, the values of Cr can be calculated as 1.420 and\n1.405, respectively. In this calculation p2 has to be determined for isentropic conditions,\nsuch as those in Fig. 3-7 or 3-8 for the given nozzle area ratio. The sea-level spe-\ncific impulse is therefore corrected to 1, = 222(1.425/1.420) = 223 sec. The chamber\npressure has to be reduced from 328 psi to a lower value in order to bring the thrust\nfrom its test value of 541.0 lbf to the design value of 500 Ibf. In accordance with Eq.\n3-31, F = CrA;p,. The throat area A; is the same for the experimental and flight thrust\nchambers. The chamber pressure is inversely proportional to the thrust coefficient Cy and\nproportional to the thrust, and therefore\n\npilp') = (Fi/F1)(C'F/Cr) (11-8)\nThe primes refer to the component test condition. The desired value of p; is\nP1 = 328(500/541)(1.420/1.425) = 304 psi\n\nIt is 1.3% off the value assumed originally (300 psi), and this is close enough for\n\npreliminary design. The desired total propellant flow is, from Eq. 2-5,\nw = F/I, = 500/220 = 2.27 lbf/sec\n\nFor a mixture ratio of 1.30, the desired fuel and oxidizer flows are obtained from Eqs.\n6-3 and 6\u20144 as wy = 0.975 Ibf/sec and Ww, = 1.267 Ibf/sec. Next, the various measured\ncomponent pressure drops are corrected to the desired flow values and to the corrected\npropellant densities in accordance with Eq. 8-2, which applies to all hydraulic devices.\nBy neglecting variations in discharge coefficients, which are believed to be very small,\nthis equation can be rewritten into a convenient form:\n\nw/w! = /p/p'V Ap/Ap\u2019 (11-9)\n\nSolve for the estimated pressure drop during operating conditions.

There is a trend to require tighter\ntolerances on rocket engine parameters (such as thrust, mixture ratio, or specific\nimpulse), and therefore the measurements, calibrations, and adjustments are also\nbeing performed to much tighter tolerances than was customary 40 years ago.\nEngine Health Monitoring System\nHealth monitoring systems (HMS) for rocket engines also called condition moni-\ntoring systems are sophisticated engine control systems. The HMS evolved from\nconventional sets of measuring instruments about 20 years ago, when the first\nrudimentary forms of HMS were used. Today there are several variations or\ntypes of HMSs. References 11-5, 11-11, and 11-12 show different aspects of\nan HMS.\n",
    "446": "11.5. ENGINE SYSTEM CALIBRATION 429\n\nHMSs are used to monitor the performance and behavior of an operating liq-\nuid propellant engine by measuring and recording in real time key parameters\nof an engine such as chamber pressure, pump speed, or turbine gas inlet tem-\nperature. It can also be used to calibrate an engine. A computer would compare\nthe actually measured but corrected data with the intended or desired nominal\ndata of an engine operating at the intended design condition (which was obtained\nby analysis or prior data from earlier engines, which had performed satisfacto-\nrily). The computer would analyze the results and provide output indicating a\nneed for action, such as changing calibration orifices, trimming an impeller, or\nvalve timing adjustments. This remedial action would not be actually initiated\nby the HMS, but the corrective work would be done by test technicians or the\nfactory. This improved calibration can be done on ground tests of R&D engines\nor production engines.\n\nHMSs are also used extensively during ground development testing where\nsimilar parameters are monitored and measured, but many impending potential\nor incipient failures can also be detected, and the HMS computer can quickly\ntake remedial action before an actual failure occurs. This has saved much R&D\nhardware. A more detailed description of this second HMS application can be\nfound in Section 21.3. Also this first function and the test stand failure remedy\nfunction can be combined.\n\nIn the third application the HMS is used during lift-off of a launch vehicle and\nit is discussed below. The HMS monitors the booster engines during their start\nperiod (by checking key engine parameters in real time against their intended\ndesign values) and determines if the engine is healthy or is likely to experience\nan impending failure after the engine has been fully started on the launch stand,\nbut just before the vehicle is released and allowed to fly. It provides a safety\nfeature not only for the booster engine(s), but also for the launch vehicle. The\nmeasurements are performed for a few seconds only during the start period and\ncan include readings from instruments for various valve positions, turbopump\nshaft speed, pump suction pressure, gas temperature of the gas generator or\npreburner, or chamber pressure. If the HMS determines that the liquid propellant\nrocket engine(s) are healthy, it gives a signal to the vehicle computer and/or the\nlaunch facility computer and the vehicle will be released, allowing the launch to\nproceed. If the HMS detects a major potential or impending failure in one of the\nbooster engines (and this may often be sensed in many engines before the full\nthrust is attained), it sends a signal to the vehicle not to launch. It also initiates\nthe safe shutdown of all the booster engines installed in the vehicle held on the\nlaunch stand, before the impending failure and major damage can take place. The\nSSME start sequence in Fig. 11\u20143 shows that starting requires about 4.4 sec to\nreach full thrust and about 3 sec to reach 50% of full thrust, so there is sample\ntime for an HMS application.\n\nThe nominal intended value of each measured parameter is usually based on\na theoretical analysis of the transient behavior of the engine during the start and\nit usually has been validated and modified by actual data from measurements of\nprior rocket engines. With each nominal intended value there is an upper and a\n",
    "447": "430 ENGINE SYSTEMS, CONTROLS, AND INTEGRATION\n\nlower limit line, known as red lines. If the actual measured value fall between the\ntwo limit lines, then the measured parameter is satisfactory. If it goes over one\nof the limit lines, then it is an indication of improper engine behavior. By itself\na single off-limit measurement is not necessarily an indication of failure. If there\nshould be a potential impending failure, the HMS has to have a verification of\nthis fact; it should not rely on just this single malfunction indication because the\nmeasuring instrument or its signal processing may be flawed. Usually when there\nis a real likely future failure, more then one instrument will have measurements\nwhich exceed a red line. For example, if the fuel pump discharge line is well\nbelow its intended value of pressure or flow at a particular time during the start\nsequence, it may indicate an insufficient supply of fuel to the pump, fuel that\nmay be warmer than it should be, a low pump speed, or a possible leak of this\npropellant. It would be validated by measurements of the suction pressure to the\npump, temperature measurements at the pump, shaft rpm, or a sensor for fuel\nin the engine compartment. With three such out of tolerance readings, and with\nan assessment of the severity of the potential failure, the HMS automatically\nregisters it as a real impending failure. The HMS will immediately send a signal\nto the vehicle computer and the ground control computer of an impending engine\nfailure (stopping the vehicle release or the launch). This same signal will initiate\na safe shutdown of all booster engines.\n\nOnce the vehicle is launched the HMS continues to check and record the\nperformance and various engine parameters, but is not usually programmed to\nimplement remedies during flight, such as changing gas temperature or changing\nthrust level. However, with multiple engines, one of the engines can be shut\ndown and the mission can then be completed by firing the other engines for a\nlonger duration, but providing the same total impulse. The mission can then be\ncompleted by firing the remaining functioning engines (at a reduced total thrust,\nbut a longer duration) using essentially all the propellants. The flight controller in\nthe vehicle has to be programmed to allow a lower thrust of longer duration, and\nthe flight path will be different, but the mission can be completed. This shutdown\nof one of the engines during flight has actually happened in a five-engine cluster\nconfiguration and the flight mission was satisfactorily completed on four engines.\n11.6. SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND ENGINE OPTIMIZATION\nRocket engines are part of a vehicle and must interact and be integrated with\nother vehicle subsystems. There are interfaces (connections, wires, or pipelines)\nbetween the engine and the vehicle\u2019s structure, electric power system, flight\ncontrol system (commands for start or thrust vector control), and ground support\nsystem (for check-out or propellant supply). The engine also imposes limitations\non vehicle components by its heat emissions, noise, and vibrations.\n\nIntegration means that the engine and the vehicle are compatible with each\nother, interfaces are properly designed, and there is no interference or unnecessary\n",
    "448": "11.6. SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND ENGINE OPTIMIZATION 431\nduplication of functions with other subsystems. The engine works with other\nsubsystems to enhance the vehicle\u2019s performance and reliability, and reduce the\ncost. Some organizations use \u201csystem engineering\u201d techniques to achieve this\nintegration. See Ref. 11-7. In Chapter 19 we describe the process of selecting\nrocket propulsion systems and it includes a discussion of interfaces and vehicle\nintegration. This discussion in Chapter 19 is supplementary and applies to several\ndifferent rocket propulsion systems. This section concerns liquid propellant rocket\nengines.\n\nSince the propulsion system is usually the major mass of the vehicle, its struc-\nture (which usually includes the tanks) often becomes a key structural element of\nthe vehicle and has to withstand not only the thrust force but also various vehicle\nloads, such as aerodynamic forces or vibrations. Several alternate tank geometries\nand locations (fuel, oxidizer, and pressurizing gas tanks), different tank pressures,\nand different structural connections have to be evaluated to determine the best\narrangement.\n\nThe thermal behavior of the vehicle is strongly affected by the heat generation\n(hot plume, hot engine components, or aerodynamic heating) and the heat\nabsorption (the liquid propellants are usually heat sinks) and by heat rejection\nto its surroundings. Many vehicle components must operate within narrow\ntemperature limits, and their thermal designs can be critical when evaluated\nin terms of the heat balance during, after, and before the rocket engine\noperation.\n\nOptimization studies are conducted to select the best values or to optimize var-\nious vehicle parameters such as vehicle performance (see below), thrust, number\nof restarts, or engine compartment geometry. These studies are usually performed\nby the vehicle designers with help from the propulsion system designers. The\nrocket engine designers conduct optimization studies (with help from the vehicle\ndesigners) on engine parameters such as chamber pressure (or thrust), mixture\nratio (which affects average propellant density and specific impulse), number of\nthrust chambers, nozzle area ratio, or engine volume. By changing one or more of\nthese parameters, it is usually possible to make some improvement to the vehicle\nperformance (0.1 to 5.0%), its reliability, or to reduce costs. Depending on the\nmission or application, the studies are aimed at maximizing one or more vehi-\ncle parameter such as range, vehicle velocity increment, payload, circular orbit\naltitude, propellant mass fraction, or minimizing costs. For example, the mix-\nture ratio of hydrogen\u2014oxygen engines for maximum specific impulse is about\n3.6, but most engines operate at mixture ratios between 5 and 6 because the\ntotal propellant volume is less, and this allows a reduced mass for the propellant\ntanks and the turbopump (resulting in a higher vehicle velocity increment) and\na reduced vehicle drag (more net thrust). The selection of the best nozzle area\nratio was mentioned in Chapter 3; it depends on the flight path\u2019s altitude\u2014time\nhistory; the increase in specific impulse is offset by the extra nozzle weight and\nlength. The best thrust\u2014time profile can also usually be optimized, for a given\napplication, by using trajectory analyses.\n",

In comparison to liquid rockets, solid rockets\nare usually relatively simple, are easy to apply (they often constitute most of the\nvehicle structure), and require little servicing; they cannot be fully checked out\nprior to use, and thrust cannot usually be randomly varied in flight.\n\nFigures 1-5 and 12-1 show the principal components and features of\nrelatively simple solid propellant rocket motors.

Figures 12-2 to 12-4 illustrate representative designs for some of the\nmajor categories of rocket motors listed in Table 12\u20141: namely, a large booster\nor second stage, a motor for space flight, and a tactical missile motor. Reference\n12-1 is useful for component and design information. The Atlas V solid rocket\nbooster (SRB) shown in Fig. 12\u20142 is representative of a modern, large solid\nbooster designed by Aerojet General Corp. Depending on the payload, there can\nbe up to five boosters mounted in the manner shown in the sketch of Fig. 4-14\nlabeled parallel staging. Several SRBs can be seen in Fig. 1\u201413 boosting the\nAtlas V. The motor grain is a tubular design with slots at the aft end; this style of\ngrain corresponds to the third sketch from the top on Fig. 12\u201416. The propellant\nconsists of aluminized hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)/ammonium\nperchlorate (AP) (see Chapter 13). The case structure is a large, lightweight\ngraphite\u2014fiber\u2014composite unit that unlike the Shuttle\u2019s SRMs (see Fig. 15-2)\nhas no segments or joints. This motor has been designed with a mechanical release\ndevice, which separates the motor after SRB burnout. A new erosion-resistant\ninternal insulation based on EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer, see\nSection 13.6.) has been introduced; EPDM is a low-density rubber-like material.\nIn common with other SRMs, some nonpropellant material such as insulation and\nnozzle liner and throat insert is burned, decomposed, eroded, charred, and ejected\nduring propellant burning, which amounts to about 1% of the propellant mass.\nThe propellant mass fraction is estimated to be about 0.90 for the bare motor.\n\nThere are several ways for classifying solid propellant rockets. Some are listed\nin Table 12-2 together with some definitions. Table 12\u20143 gives characteristics\nfor three specific rocket motors, and from these data one can obtain a feeling for\nthe magnitudes of the key parameters. These motors are shown in Figs. 18-5\nand 18-9.\n\nAlmost all rocket motors are used only once. The hardware that remains after\nall the propellant has been burned and the mission completed\u2014namely, the\nnozzle, case, or thrust vector control device\u2014is not reusable. In very rare appli-\ncations, such as NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle solid booster, is the hardware recovered,\ncleaned, refurbished, and reloaded; reusability makes the design more complex,\nbut if the hardware is reused often enough a major cost saving will result. Unlike\nsome liquid propellant rocket engines, a solid propellant rocket motor and its\nkey components cannot be operationally pretested. As a result, individual motor\nreliability must be inferred by assuring the structural integrity and verifying man-\nufacturing quality on the entire population of motors.\n\n12.1.

The rate of regression, usually expressed in cm/sec,\nmm/sec, or in./sec, is the burning rate r.

Full-scale motors with good instrumentation\n\nA strand burner is a small pressure vessel (usually with windows) in which a\nthin strand or bar of propellant is ignited at one end and burned to the other end.\nThe strand can be inhibited with an external coating so that it will burn only on the\nexposed cross-sectional surface; chamber pressure is simulated by pressurizing\nthe container with inert gas. The burning rate can be measured by electric signals\nfrom embedded wires, by ultrasonic waves, or by optical means (Ref. 12\u20142). The\nburning rate measured on strand burners is usually lower than that obtained from\nmotor firing (by 4 to 12%) because it does not truly simulate the hot chamber\nenvironment. Also small ballistic evaluation motors usually have a slightly lower\nburning rate than full-scale larger motors because of scaling factors. The rela-\ntionship between the three measured burning rates is determined empirically for\neach propellant category and grain configuration. Strand burner data are useful\nin screening propellant formulations and in quality control operations. Data from\nfull-scale motors tested under a variety of conditions constitute the final proof of\nburning rate behavior.

The total mass m of effective\npropellant burned can be determined by integrating Eq. 12-1:\n\nm= [o dt = pp [avr dt (12-2)\n\nwhere A, and r vary with time and pressure.\nMass Flow Relations\nThe first basic performance relation is derived from the principle of conservation\nof matter. The gaseous propellant mass evolving from the burning surface per\nunit time must equal the sum of the change in mass storage per unit time in the\ncombustion chamber (due to increases in volume of the grain cavity) and the\nmass flowing out through the exhaust nozzle per unit time,\n\nApr py = d(piVi)/dt + Arp. /c* (12-3)\nThe term on the left side of the equation represents the rate of gas generation from\nEq. 12-1. The first term on the right represents the storage rate of the hot gas\nin the combustion chamber volume, and the last term represents the propellant\nflow rate through the nozzle according to Eqs. 3\u201424 and 3-32. The propel-\nlant burning rate is r and A, is the propellant burning area; p,, is the solid propellant\ndensity and p; is the chamber hot-gas density; V,; represents the chamber gas\ncavity volume which becomes larger as the propellant is burnt and expended; A;\nis the throat area; p; the chamber pressure; c* is the characteristic velocity which\nis proportional to 7), the absolute chamber temperature (which is known from\nthe thermochemistry for a given propellant); and k is the specific heat ratio of the\ncombustion gases (see Eq. 3\u201432). Equation 12\u20143 is useful in numerical solutions\nof transient conditions, such as during startup or shutdown, but the version without\nthe storage rate term is the one most often used. During startup the rate of change\nof hot gas in the grain cavity is always an important factor.\n\nThe value of the burning surface A, may or may not change with time and\nis a function of the grain design as described in Section 12.3.

An enlarging throat area A; with time causes\na decrease of chamber pressure, burning rate, and thrust.\n\nThe chamber gas volume V, will increase measurably with burn time. But\nto fill this void requires relatively small amounts of gaseous propellant mass\ncompared to what flows through the nozzle (the volume change of a unit of mass\nis about 1000 to | as the propellant gasifies during the combustion). As a result,\nthe term d(p,V,)/dt can usually be neglected. This then yields the commonly\nused relation for the pressure in steady burning:\n\npi = Kppre* (12-4)\nwhere\n\nK =A)/A;\n\nHere K represents a new and important dimensionless motor parameter, the ratio\nof burning area to nozzle throat area, which has typical values much larger than\none. For steady flow and steady burning the value of Ap, (or K) must remain\nessentially constant. We will return to Eq. 12\u20144 in Eq. 12-6 after introducing\nan empirical relation for the burning rate.\nBurning Rate Relation with Pressure\nClassical equations relating to the burning rate are helpful in preliminary design,\ndata extrapolation, and in understanding the phenomena involved; however, ana-\nlytical modeling and the supportive research have yet to adequately predict the\nburning rate of a new propellant in a new motor. Ordinary laws and equations\non burning rate only deal with the influence of some of the important parameters\nindividually. Unless otherwise stated, the burning rate specified is based on an\nambient temperature of 70\u00b0F or 294 K for the propellant (prior to ignition) and\na reference chamber operating pressure of 1000 psia or 6.895 MPa.\n\nWith many propellants it is possible to approximate the burning rate as a\nfunction of chamber pressure, at least over a limited range of chamber pressures.\nA log-log set of plots is shown in Fig. 12\u20146. For a majority of production-type\npropellants the most commonly used empirical equation is\n\nr=ap} (12-5)\nwhere r, the burning rate, is usually in mm/sec or in./sec and the chamber oper-\nating pressure p; is in MPa or psia.

The precise opposite is\ntrue with n > 1.0. In other words, as the pressure decreases, the nozzle can accommodate\nless flow than is being generated for n < 1 but more for n > 1. From stability considera-\ntions, in the former case the flow can physically adjust and remain quasi-steady while in\nthe latter it cannot. Hence, n must be less than one for all solid propellants (with constant\nthroat area systems). It will be seen than n = 1.0 is problematic from other considerations.\n[Note that, strictly speaking, any flow equality at the nominal pressure is invalid as the\nchamber pressure fluctuates, meaning that a steady state is no longer valid but for small\nchanges the arguments presented are valid.]\n\nFrom inspection of the above results and also from Eq. 12-7, it can be seen\nthat the hot gas flow rate is quite sensitive to the exponent n. High values on n\ngive rapid changes of burning rate with pressure. This implies that even a small\nnatural variation in chamber pressure induces substantial changes in the amount\nof hot gas produced. Most commercially available propellants have a pressure\nexponent n ranging between 0.2 and 0.6. As n approaches 1.0, the burning rate\nand chamber pressure become very sensitive to one another and a disastrous\nrise in chamber pressure can occur in a few milliseconds. On the other hand, a\npropellant having a pressure exponent of zero displays essentially zero change\nin burning rate over a wide pressure range. Plateau propellants is the name\ngiven to those that exhibit nearly constant burning rate over a limited pressure\nrange, and they are desirable for minimizing the effects of changes in initial\ntemperature on motor operation as described in the next section. One plateau\npropellant is shown as a dash line in Fig. 12\u20146. These propellants are only\ninsensitive to major changes in chamber pressure over a limited range.

Since o, is an often tabulated material/propellant property,\nEq. 12-14 shows how zx may be obtained from op and highlights a strong\ndependence of zx on the burning rate exponent n.

The inclusion\nof Cr changes would affect these results by only a few percent.\n\nIn the example above the variation of chamber pressure affects the thrust and\nburning time of the rocket motor. When operating with warm or cold grains, the\nthrust can easily vary by a factor of 2, and this may cause significant changes\nof flight performance during atmospheric flight (because of different drag in\nthe vehicle\u2019s flight path).

Here,\nit may no longer be possible to predict the pressure excursions with ambient\ntemperature changes using Eq. 12\u201410; this can be seen from Eq. 12-14 by noting\nthat in the constant-n case zx depends only on a material/propellant property (a, )\nand on n. An upward concavity in the propellant burning rate data may result\nin larger excursions of chamber pressure than constant-n cases would predict.\nThe opposite would hold true for a downward concavity. Such variations may\nbe accommodated by piecewise curve fitting the data with constant n values in\npreselected ranges of interest (see Ref. 12\u20144), provided the pressure increments\nin these curve fits are small enough.\n\nWhen the piecewise constant-burning-rate-exponent n approach is not satis-\nfactory, a useful approach would be to assume that n depends only on p;, keeping\nall previous dependences intact (retaining a in Eq. 12\u20145 as the only function of\nT;).

As stated earlier, Eq. 12\u20145 is only approximately met for many\nsolid propellants.\n\nBurning Enhancement by Erosion\n\nErosive burning refers to the increase in the propellant burning rate caused by\nthe high-velocity flow of combustion gases over the burning propellant surface. It\ncan seriously affect the performance of solid propellant rocket motors. It occurs\nprimarily in the port passages or perforations of the grain as the combustion\ngases flow toward the nozzle; it is more likely to occur when the port passage\ncross-sectional area A is small relative to the throat area A; with a port-to-throat\narea ratio of 4 or less. An analysis of erosive burning is given in Ref. 12\u20145. The\nhigh velocity near the burning surface and the turbulent mixing in the boundary\nlayers increase the heat transfer to the solid propellant and thus increase the\nburning rate. Chapter 10 of Ref. 12-6 surveys about 29 different theoretical\nanalytical treatments and a variety of experimental techniques aimed at a better\nunderstanding of erosive burning.\n\nErosive burning increases the mass flow and thus also the chamber pressure\nand thrust during the early portion of the burning, as shown in Fig. 12-9 for a\nparticular motor. As soon as the burning enlarges the flow passage (without a\nmajor increase in burning area), the port area flow velocity is reduced and erosive\nburning diminishes until normal burning will again occur.

Erosive burning also causes\nearly burnout of the web, usually at the nozzle end, and exposes the insulation and\naft closure to hot combustion gas for a longer period of time; this usually requires\nmore insulation layer thickness (and more inert mass) to prevent local thermal\nfailure. In designing motors, erosive burning is either avoided or controlled to\nbe reproducible from one motor to the next.\n\nA relatively simple model for erosive burning, based on heat transfer, was\nfirst developed in 1956 by Lenoir and Robillard (Ref. 12\u20145) and has since been\nimproved and used widely in motor performance calculations. It is based on\nadding together two burn rates: r9, which is primarily a function of pressure\nand ambient grain temperature (basically Eq. 12\u20145) without erosion, and r,, the\nincrease in burn rate due to gas velocity or erosion effects:\n\nr=rotle\n= ap! + aG\u00b0SD~\"exp(\u2014Brps/G) an\")\n\nHere G is the mass flow velocity per unit area in kg/m?-sec, D is a char-\nacteristic dimension of the port passage (usually, D = 4A,/S, where Ap is the\nport area and S is its perimeter), p, is the density of the unburned propellant\n(kg/m), and @ and f are empirically constants.

There is a pressure drop from\nthe forward end to the aft end of the port passage, because static pressure energy\nis converted into kinetic gas energy as the flow is accelerated. This pressure\ndifferential during erosive burning causes an extra axial load and deformation\non the grain, which must be considered in the stress analysis.

This phenomenon has been experienced with a variety of propellants,\nwith and without aluminum fuel, and the propellant formulation is one of the\ncontrolling variables (see Fig. 12-11). Whether the acceleration is from spin or\nlongitudinal force, burning surfaces that form an angle of 60 to 90\u00b0 with the\nacceleration vector are most prone to burning rate enhancement. For example,\nspinning cylindrical interal burning grains are heavily affected. The effect of spin\non a motor with an operational composite propellant internal burning grain is\nshown in Fig. 12\u201412. The accelerated burning behavior of candidate propellants\nfor a new motor design is often determined in small-scale motors, or in a test\napparatus which subjects burning propellant to acceleration (Refs. 12-8 and\n12-9).

Radiation of the exhaust plume (outside of the nozzle) and the\neffect of particles in the gas are discussed in Chapter 20.\n\nCombustion instability , also called oscillatory combustion, can affect the burn-\ning rate of the propellant because of increased heat transfer rate, gas velocity,\nand high pressure. This is discussed in Chapter 14.\n\n12.2. OTHER PERFORMANCE ISSUES\n\nThose parameters that govern the burning rate and mass discharge rate of motors\nare called internal ballistic properties; they include r, K, op, 7x, and the influ-\nences caused by pressure, propellant ingredients, gas velocity, or acceleration. The\nsubsequent solid propellant rocket parameters are performance parameters; they\ninclude thrust, ideal exhaust velocity, specific impulse, propellant mass fraction,\nflame temperature, temperature limits, and duration.\n\nThe ideal nozzle exhaust velocity of a solid propellant rocket is dependent\non the thermodynamic theory as given by Eq. 3-15 or 3-16. As explained\nin Chapter 5, this equation holds only for frozen equilibrium conditions; for\nshifting equilibrium the exhaust velocity is best defined in terms of the enthalpy\ndrop (A; \u2014 hz), which can be computed from v2 = /2(h; \u2014 hz). In deriving the\nexhaust velocity equation, it was assumed that the approach velocity of gases\nupstream of the nozzle is small and can be neglected. This is true if the port\narea Ap (the flow area of gases between and around the propellant grains) is\nrelatively large compared to the nozzle throat area A;. When the port-to-throat-\narea ratio A,/A; is less than about 4, a pressure drop correction must be made\nto the effective exhaust velocity.\n\nThe thrust for solid propellant rockets is given by the identical definitions\ndeveloped in Chapters 2 and 3, namely, Eqs. 2-14 and 3-29. The flame or\ncombustion temperature is a thermochemical property of the propellant formula-\ntion and the chamber pressure. It not only affects the exhaust velocity, but also\nthe hardware design, flame radiation emission, materials selection, and the heat\ntransfer to the grain and hardware. In Chapter 5 methods for its calculation are\nexplained. The determination of the nozzle throat area, nozzle expansion area\nratio, and nozzle dimensions is discussed in Chapter 3.\n\nThe effective exhaust velocity c and the specific impulse I, are defined by\nEqs. 2-3, 2\u20144, and 2-6. It is experimentally difficult to measure the instan-\ntaneous propellant flow rate or the effective exhaust velocity. However, total\nimpulse and total propellant mass consumed during the test can be measured.\nThe approximate propellant mass is determined by weighing the rocket before\nand after a test. The effective propellant mass is often slightly less than the total\npropellant mass, because some grain designs permit small portions of the pro-\npellant to remain unburned during combustion, as is explained in a later chapter.\n",
    "476": "12.2. OTHER PERFORMANCE ISSUES 459\nAlso, a portion of the nozzle and insulation materials erodes and vaporizes dur-\ning the rocket motor burning, and this reduces the final inert mass of the motor\nand also slightly increases the nozzle mass flow. This explains the difference\nbetween the total inert mass and the burnout mass in Table 12-3. It has been\nfound that the total impulse can be accurately determined in testing by integrating\nthe area under a thrust time curve. For this reason the average specific impulse\nis usually calculated from total measured impulse and effective propellant mass.\nThe total impulse J; is defined by Eq. 2\u20141 as the integration of thrust F over the\noperating duration t,:\nth _\nI -|/ Fdt=F tp (12-19)\n0\nwhere F is an average value of thrust over the burning duration ty.\n\nThe burning time, action time, and pressure rise time at ignition are defined\nin Fig. 12-13.

Merely quoting a number for specific impulse without further explanation\nleaves many questions unanswered. This is similar to the four performance values\nfor liquid propellant engines listed in Section 3.5. Specific impulse as diminished\nby several losses can be predicted as shown in Ref. 12-13.\n\nLosses include the nozzle inefficiencies due to viscous boundary layer friction\nand nonaxial flow as described in Chapter 3, thrust vector deflection as described\nin Chapter 18, residual unburned propellants, heat losses to the walls or insulators,\nincomplete combustion, or the presence of solid particles in the gas which need\nto be accelerated. There are also some performance gains; the gases (created by\nablation of the ablative nozzle and insulators or the igniter propellants) contribute\nto an increased mass flow, in many cases also to a somewhat lower average\nmolecular weight of the gas and to a slight reduction of the final inert mass after\nrocket motor operation.\n\nThe two-phase flow equations for calculating specific impulse can be solved\nif the size distribution, shape, and percentage of solid particles in the exhaust gas\nare known. The assumption of a uniform average spherical particle diameter sim-\nplifies the analysis (Ref. 12\u201413), and this diameter can be estimated from specific\nimpulse measurements on rocket motor tests (Ref. 12-14). Section 3.5 gives a\nsimple theory for two-phase flow of solid particles in a gas flow. Sometimes\ndensity-specific impulse, the specific gravity of the propellant grain multiplied\nby specific impulse, is stated as a performance parameter, particularly in rocket\nmotor applications where a compact design is desirable (see Eq. 7\u20143).\n\nPropellants burn to varying degrees of completeness depending on the fuel,\nthe oxidizer, their ratios, the energy losses, and the environment within the motor.\nPropellants with nonmetal fuels usually burn with a velocity correction factor of\n97 or 98%, as contrasted to 90 to 96% for propellants with aluminum powder as\nthe fuel. The solid particles in the exhaust do not contribute to the gas expansion,\nrequire energy to be accelerated, and two-phase flow is less efficient. However,\nthe addition of the aluminum increases the heat of combustion, the chamber\ngas temperature, and thus the exhaust velocity or specific impulse. This increase\nusually outweighs the loss for having to accelerate the small solid aluminum\noxide particles.\n\nThe propellant mass fraction \u00a2 was defined in Eq. 2-8 as \u00a2 = m,/mpo, and\nit is directly related to the motor mass ratio and therefore also to the flight\nperformance of the vehicle. The initial motor mass mo is the sum of the useful\nsolid propellant mass mp, and the nonburning, inert hardware mass of the motor.\n",

OTHER PERFORMANCE ISSUES 461\nFor a vehicle\u2019s propellant mass fraction, the payload mass and the nonpropulsion\ninert mass (vehicle structure, guidance and control, communications equipment,\nand power supply) have to be added. A high value of \u00a2 indicates a low inert\nmotor mass, an efficient design of the hardware, and high stresses. This parameter\nhas been used to make approximate preliminary design estimates. It is a function\nof motor size or mass, thrust level, the nozzle area ratio, and the material used for\nthe case. For very small motors (less than 100 Ibm) the value of the propellant\nfraction is between 0.3 and 0.75. Medium-sized motors (100 < mo < 1000 Ibm)\nhave \u00a2 values between 0.8 and 0.91. For larger motors (1000 < mg < 50,000 Ibm)\n\u00a2 is between 0.88 and 0.945. A range of values is given for each category because\nof the influence of the following other variables. Medium- and large-sized motors\nwith steel cases generally have lower \u00a2 values than those with titanium cases,\nand their values are lower than for cases made of Kevlar fibers in an epoxy\nmatrix. The highest values are for cases made of graphite or carbon fibers in an\nepoxy matrix. The \u00a2 values are lower for larger area ratio nozzles and motors\nwith thrust vector control. The STAR\u2122 27 rocket motor, shown in Fig. 12-1\nand described in Table 12\u20143, has a propellant mass fraction of 0.924. This is\nhigh for a medium-sized motor with a titanium metal case and a relatively large\nnozzle exit section.\n\nA number of performance parameters are used to evaluate solid propellant\nrockets and to compare the quality of design of one rocket with another. The\nfirst is the total-impulse-to-loaded-weight ratio (I;/wgG). The loaded weight wg\nis the sea-level initial gross weight of propellant and rocket propulsion system\nhardware. Typical values for J;/wg are between 100 and 230 sec, with the higher\nvalues representative of high-performance rocket propellants and highly stressed\nhardware, which means a low inert mass. The total-impulse-to-loaded-weight\nratio ideally approaches the value of the specific impulse. When the weight of\nhardware, metal parts, inhibitors, and so on becomes very small in relation to\nthe propellant weight wy, then the ratio I;/wgG approaches I,;/w, which is the\ndefinition of the average specific impulse (Eqs. 2\u20143 and 2\u20144). The higher the\nvalue of J; /wg, the better the design of a rocket unit. Another parameter used for\ncomparing propellants is the volume impulse; it is defined as the total impulse\nper unit volume of propellant grain, or I;/Vp.\n\nThe thrust-to-weight ratio F /wg is a dimensionless parameter that is identical\nto the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of go)\nif it could fly by itself in a gravity-free vacuum; it excludes other vehicle compo-\nnent weights. It is peculiar to the application and can vary from very low values\nof less than one gg to over 1000 go for high acceleration applications of solid\npropellant rocket motors. Some rocket-assisted gun munitions have accelerations\nof 20,000 go.\n\nThe temperature limits refer to the maximum and minimum storage tempera-\ntures to which a motor can be exposed without risk of damage to the propellant\ngrain.

The propellant material and geometrical configuration of the grain\ndetermine the motor performance characteristics. The propellant grain is a cast,\nmolded, or extruded body, and its appearance and feel is similar to that of\nhard rubber or plastic. Once ignited, it will burn on all its exposed surfaces to\nform hot gases that are then exhausted through a nozzle. A few rocket motors\nhave more than one grain inside a single case or chamber, and very few grains\nhave segments made of different propellant composition (e.g., to allow different\nburning rates). However, most rockets have a single grain.\n\nThere are two methods of holding the grain in the case, as seen in Fig. 12-14.\nCartridge-loaded or freestanding grains are manufactured separately from the\ncase (by extrusion or by casting into a cylindrical mold or cartridge) and then\nloaded into or assembled into the case. In case-bonded grains the case is used as\na mold and the propellant is cast directly into the case and is bonded to the case or\ncase insulation. Freestanding grains can more easily be replaced if the propellant\ngrain has aged excessively. Aging is discussed in the next chapter. Cartridge-\nloaded grains are used in some small tactical missiles and a few medium-sized\nmotors. They often have a lower cost and are easier to inspect. The case-bonded\ngrains give a somewhat better performance, a little less inert mass (no holding\ndevice, support pads, and less insulation), a better volumetric loading fraction,\nare more highly stressed, and often somewhat more difficult and expensive to\nmanufacture. Today almost all larger motors and many tactical missile motors use\ncase bonding.

The grain geometry is selected to fit these requirements; it should be\ncompact and use the available volume efficiently, have an appropriate\nburn surface versus time profile to match the desired thrust\u2014time curve,\nand avoid or predictably control possible erosive burning. The remaining\nunburned propellant slivers, and often also the shift of the center of gravity\nduring burning, should be minimized. This selection of the geometry can\nbe complex, and it is discussed in Refs. 12-1 and 12-7 and also below in\nthis section.\n\n3. The propellant is usually selected on the basis of its performance capability\n(e.g., characteristic velocity), mechanical properties (e.g., strength), ballistic\nproperties (e.g., burning rate), manufacturing characteristics, exhaust plume\ncharacteristics, and aging properties. If necessary, the propellant formula-\ntion may be slightly altered or \u201ctailored\u201d to fit exactly the required burning\ntime or grain geometry. Propellant selection is discussed in Chapter 13 and\nin Ref. 12-7.\n",
    "484": "12.3. PROPELLANT GRAIN AND GRAIN CONFIGURATION 467\n\n4. The structural integrity of the grain, including its liner and/or insulator,\nmust be analyzed to assure that the grain will not fail in stress or strain\nunder all conditions of loading, acceleration, or thermal stress. The grain\ngeometry can be changed to reduce excessive stresses. This is discussed in\nthe next section of this chapter.\n\n5. The complex internal cavity volume of perforations, slots, ports, and fins\nincreases with burning time. These cavities need to be checked for reso-\nnance, damping, and combustion stability. This is discussed in Chapter 14.\n\n6. The processing of the grain and the fabrication of the propellant should be\nrepeatable, simple, low cost (see Chapter 13), and cause acceptable thermal\nstresses.\n\nThe grain configuration is designed to satisfy most requirements, but some-\ntimes some of these six categories are satisfied only partially. The geometry\nis crucial in grain design. For a neutral burning grain (approximately constant\nthrust), for example, the burning surface Ap has to stay approximately constant,\nand for a regressive burning grain the burning area will diminish during the\nburning time. From Eqs. 12\u20145 and 12-6 the trade-off between burning rate\nand the burning surface area is evident, and the change of burning surface with\ntime has a strong influence on chamber pressure and thrust. Since the density of\nmost modern propellants falls within a narrow range (about 0.066 Ibm/in.> or\n1830 kg/m>+2 to \u201415%), it has little influence on the grain design.\n\nAs a result of motor developments of the past four decades, many grain con-\nfigurations are available to motor designers. As methods evolved for increasing\nthe propellant burning rate, the number of configurations needed decreased. Cur-\nrent designs concentrate on relatively few configurations, since the needs of a\nwide variety of solid rocket applications can be fulfilled by combining known\nconfigurations or by slightly altering a classical configuration. The trend has been\nto discontinue configurations that give weak grains which can form cracks, pro-\nduce high sliver losses, have a low volumetric loading fraction, or are expensive\nto manufacture.\n\nThe effect of propellant burning on surface area is readily apparent for simple\ngeometric shapes such as rods, tubes, wedges, and slots, as shown in the top\nfour configurations of Fig. 12-16. Certain other basic surface shapes burn as\nfollows: external burning rod\u2014regressive; external burning wedge\u2014regressive.\nMost propellant grains combine two or more of these basic surfaces to obtain the\ndesired burning characteristic. The star perforation, for example, combines the\nwedge and the internal burning tube. Figure 12-17 indicates typical single grains\nwith combinations of two basic shapes. The term conocyl is a contraction of the\nwords cone and cylinder.\n\nConfigurations that combine both radial and longitudinal burning, as does the\ninternal\u2014external burning tube without restricted ends, are frequently referred\nto as \u201cthree-dimensional grains\u201d even though all grains are geometrically\nthree-dimensional.

Most solid propellant manufacturers\nhave specific approaches and sophisticated computer programs for analyzing and\noptimizing grain geometry alternatives and permitting burn surface and cavity\nvolume analysis. See Refs. 12\u201415 and 12-16 and Chapters 8 and 9 of Ref. 12-1.\n\nThe end burning grain (burning like a cigarette) is unique; it burns solely\nin the axial direction and maximizes the amount of propellant that can be\nplaced in a given cylindrical motor case. In larger motors (over 0.6 m diameter)\nthese end burners show a progressive thrust curve. Figure 12-18 shows that\nthe burning surface soon forms a conical shape, causing a rise in pressure and\nthrust. Although the phenomenon is not fully understood, two factors contribute\nto higher burning rate near the bondline: chemical migration of the burning rate\ncatalyst into and toward the bondline, and local high propellant stresses and\nstrains at the bond surface, creating local cracks (Ref. 12-17).\n\nRockets used in air-launched or certain surface-launched missile applications,\nweather rockets, certain anti-aircraft or antimissile rockets, and other tactical\napplications actually benefit by reducing the thrust with burn time.

Therefore, there\nis a benefit to vehicle mass, flight performance, and cost in having a higher\ninitial thrust during the boost phase of the flight, followed by a lower thrust\n(often 10 to 30% of boost thrust) during the sustaining phase of the powered\nflight. Figure 12-19 shows grains which give two or more discrete thrust periods\nin a single burn operation. The configurations are actually combinations of the\nconfigurations listed in Table 12-4.\n\nIn a single-propellant dual-thrust level solid rocket motor, factors relating to\nthe sustain portion usually dominate in the selection of the propellant type and\ngrain configuration if most of the propellant volume is used during the longer\nsustain portion.\n\nA restartable rocket motor has advantages in a number of tactical rocket\npropulsion systems used for aircraft and missile defense applications. Here two\n(or sometimes three) grains are contained inside the same case, each with its own\nigniter. The grains are physically separated typically by a structural bulkhead or\nby an insulation layer. One method for accomplishing this is shown in Fig. 12\u201420.\nThe timing between thrust periods (sometimes called thrust pulses) can be con-\ntrolled and commanded by the missile guidance system, so as to change the\ntrajectory in a nearly optimum fashion and minimize the flight time to target. The\nseparation mechanism has to prevent the burning-hot pressurized gas of the first\ngrain from reaching the other grain and causing its inadvertent ignition. When\nthe second grain is ignited, the separation devices are automatically removed,\nfractured, or burned, but in such a manner that the fragments of hardware pieces\nwill not plug the nozzle or damage the insulation (see Refs. 12\u201418 and 12-19).\nSlivers\nAny remaining unburnt propellant is known as slivers.

About 35 years ago grain designs had 2 to 7% propellant\nslivers; this useless material caused a reduction in propellant mass fraction and\nvehicle mass ratio. The technology of grain design has advanced so that there are\nalmost no slivers (usually less than 1%). If slivers were to occur in a new unusual\ngrain design, the designer would try to replace the sliver volume with a lower-\ndensity insulator, which gives less of a mass ratio penalty than the higher-density\npropellant residue. This is shown in Fig. 12-17.\n\n12.4. PROPELLANT GRAIN STRESS AND STRAIN\n\nThe objective of stress analysis of rocket motors is to design the configuration\nof the grain, the liners, or the grain support in such a way that excessive stresses\nor excessive strains will not occur and so that there will be no failure. Static and\ndynamic loads and stresses are imposed on the propellant grains during manu-\nfacture, transportation, storage, and operation. Structurally, a rocket motor is a\nthin shell of revolution (motor case) almost completely filled with a viscoelas-\ntic material, the propellant, which usually accounts for 80 to 94% of the motor\nmass. Propellants have some mechanical properties that are not found in ordinary\nstructural materials and these have received relatively little study. The viscoelastic\nnature of solid propellant is time\u2014history dependent and the material accumu-\nlates damage from repeated stresses; this is known as the cumulative-damage\nphenomenon.\n\nThe most common failure modes are:\n\n1. Surface cracks are formed when the surface strain is excessive. They open\nup new additional burning surfaces, and this in turn causes the chamber\npressure as well as the thrust to be increased. The higher, shorter duration\nthrust will cause the vehicle to fly a different trajectory, and this may cause\nthe mission objective to be missed. With many cracks or deep cracks, the\ncase becomes overpressurized and will fail. The limiting strain depends on\nthe stress level, grain geometry, temperature, propellant age, load history,\nand the sizes of flaws or voids. At a high strain rate, deeper, more highly\nbranched cracks are more readily formed than at a lower strain rate (see\nRef. 12-10).\n\n2. The bond at the grain periphery is broken and an unbonded area or gap can\nform next to the liner, insulator, or case. As the grain surface regresses, a\npart of the unbonded area will become exposed to the hot, high-pressure\ncombustion gases, and then suddenly the burning area is increased by the\nunbonded area.\n\nOther failure modes, such as an excessively high ambient grain temperature\n\ncausing a large reduction in the physical strength properties, ultimately result\nin grain cracks and/or debonding. Air bubbles, porosity, or uneven density can\n",
    "490": "12.4. PROPELLANT GRAIN STRESS AND STRAIN 473\nlocally reduce the propellant strength sufficiently to cause failure, again by cracks\nor debonds. Other failure modes are excessive deformations of the grain (e.g.,\nslump of large grains can restrict the port area) and involuntary ignition due\nto the heat absorbed by the viscoelastic propellant from excessive mechanical\nvibration (e.g., prolonged bouncing during transport).\n\nIf the grain has a large number of small cracks or a few deep cracks or\nlarge areas of unbonding prior to firing, the burning area will increase, often\nprogressively and unpredictably, and the resulting higher pressure will almost\nalways cause the case to burst. A few small cracks or minor unbonded areas will\nusually not impede satisfactory motor operation.\n\nMaterial Characterization\n\nBefore a structural analysis can be performed it is necessary to understand the\nmaterials and obtain data on their properties. The grain materials (propellant,\ninsulator, and liner) are rubber-like materials that are nearly incompressible.\nThey all have a bulk modulus in compression of at least 1400 MPa or about\n200,000 psi in their original state (undamaged). Since there are very few voids\nin a properly made propellant (much less than 1%), its compression strain is\nlow. However, the propellant is easily damaged by applied tension and shear\nloads. If the strength of propellant in tension and shear (typically between 50\nand 1000 psi) is exceeded, the grain will be damaged or fail locally. Since\ngrains are three-dimensional, all stresses are combined stresses and not pure\ncompression stresses, and grains are thus easily damaged. This damage is due to\na \u201cdewetting\u201d of the adhesion between individual solid particles and the binder\nin the propellant and appears initially as many small voids or porosity. Those\nvery small holes or debonded areas next to or around the solid particles may\ninitially be under vacuum, but they become larger with strain growth.\n\nThe propellant, liner, and insulator with a solid filler are viscoelastic materi-\nals. They show a nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, not a linear elastic behavior.\nThis means that the maximum stress and maximum elongation or strain diminish\neach time a significant load is applied. The material becomes weaker and suffers\nsome damage with each loading cycle or thermal stress application. The phys-\nical properties also change with the time rate of applying loads; for example,\nvery fast pressurization actually gives a stronger material. Certain binders, such\nas HTPB, give good elongation and a stronger propellant than other polymers\nused with the same percentage of binder. Therefore HTPB is a preferred binder\ntoday. The physical properties are also affected by the manufacturing process.\nFor example, tensile specimens cut from the same conventionally cast grain of\ncomposite propellant can show 20 to 40% variation in the strength properties\nbetween samples of different orientations relative to the local casting slurry flow\ndirection. Viscoelastic material properties change as a function of prior loading\nand damage history. They have the capability to reheal and recover partially\nfollowing damage. Chemical deterioration will in time degrade the properties\nof many propellants. These phenomena make it difficult to characterize these\nmaterials and predict their behavior or physical properties in engineering terms.\n",
    "491": "474 SOLID PROPELLANT ROCKET FUNDAMENTALS,\n\nSeveral kinds of laboratory tests on small samples are routinely per-\nformed today to determine the physical properties of these materials. (see\nRefs. 12\u201421 and 12-22). Simple tests, however, do not properly describe the\ncomplex nonlinear behavior. These laboratory tests are conducted under ideal\nconditions\u2014mostly uniaxial stresses instead of complex three-dimensional\nstresses\u2014with a uniform temperature instead of a thermal gradient and usually\nwith no prior damage to the material. The application of laboratory test results\nto real structural analysis therefore involves several assumptions and empirical\ncorrection factors. The test data are transformed into derived parameters for\ndetermining safety margins and useful life, as described in Chapter 9 of\nRef. 12-1. There is no complete agreement on how best to characterize these\nmaterials. Nevertheless, laboratory tests provide useful information and several\nare described below.\n\nThe most common test is a simple uniaxial tensile test at constant strain\nrate. One set of results is shown in Fig. 12\u201421. The test is commonly used for\nmanufacturing quality control, propellant development, and determining failure\ncriteria.

PROPELLANT GRAIN STRESS AND STRAIN 475\nthe damage to the material changes its response and properties as shown by the\ndashed curve in Fig. 12-21.\n\nThe dewetting strain is, by definition, the strain (and corresponding maximum\nstress) where incipient failure of the interface bonds between small solid oxidizer\ncrystals and the rubbery binder occurs. The dewetting stress is analogous to the\nyield point in elastic materials, because this is when internal material damage\nbegins to happen. The slope EF, the modulus at low strain, is not ordinarily used\nin design, but is often used as a quality control parameter. Data from several\nsuch uniaxial tests at different temperatures can then be manipulated to arrive at\nallowable stresses, permissible safe strains, and a derived artificial modulus, as\ndescribed later. Once a case-bonded grain has been cooled down from its casting\ntemperature, it will have shrunk and be under multidirectional strain. Samples\ncut from different parts of a temperature-cycled grain will usually give different\ntensile test results.\n\nBiaxial strength tests are also performed frequently in the laboratory. One type\nis described in Ref. 12-21. Meaningful three-dimensional stress tests are difficult\nto perform in the laboratory and are usually not done. There are other sample tests\nthat give information about propellant behavior, such as strain endurance tests to\nobtain the levels of strain at which the propellant has long endurance and does not\nsuffer significant damage, tests at constant stress levels, fracture tests of samples\nwith known cracks or defects, tensile tests under simulated chamber pressure, or\ntests to measure the thermal coefficient of expansion. Peel tests of the adhesive\nbonds of propellants to liners or insulators are very common and their failures\nare discussed in Ref 12\u201422. The application and interpretation of all these tests\ndepend on the stress conditions in the grain and company preferences. In addition,\nstrain or stress measurements are made occasionally on full-scale, experimental,\nflight-weight motors using special embedded sensors. Care must be taken that the\nimplanting of these sensors into the grain will not disturb the local stress\u2014strain\ndistribution, which would lead to erroneous measurements.\n\nThe maximum failure stresses of most propellants are relatively low compared\nto those of plastic materials. Typical values range from about 0.25 to 8 MPa or\nabout 40 to about 1200 psi, with average values between 50 and 300 psi, and\nelongations range from 4 to 250%, depending on the specific propellant, its tem-\nperature, and its stress history. Table 12\u20145 shows properties for a relatively strong\npropellant. Some double-base propellants and binder-rich composite propellants\ncan withstand higher stresses (up to about 32 MPa or 4600 psi). The pressure and\nthe strain rate have a major influence on the physical properties. Tensile tests per-\nformed at chamber pressure give higher strength than those done at atmospheric\npressure, in some cases by a factor of 2 or more. High strain rates (sudden-start\npressurization) can also improve the propellant properties temporarily.\n\nThe strength properties of the grain material are commonly determined over a\nrange of propellant temperatures. For air-launched missiles these limits are wide,\nwith \u201465 and +160\u00b0F or 219 and 344 K often being the lower and upper extremes\nexpected during motor exposure. Propellant grains must be strong enough and\nhave elongation capability sufficient to meet the high stress concentrations present\n",

The mechanical properties (strength, elongation)\ncan be increased by increasing the percent of binder material in the propellant,\nbut at a reduction in performance.\nStructural Design\nThe structural analysis of a typical case-bonded grain has to consider not only\nthe grain itself but also the liner, insulator, and case, which interact structurally\nwith the propellant grain under various loading conditions (see Chapter 9 of\nRef. 12\u20141). The need to obtain strong bonds between the propellant and the\nliner, the liner and the insulator, or the insulator and the case is usually satisfied\nby using properly selected materials and manufacturing procedures to assure a\ngood set of bonds. Liners are usually flexible and can accept large strains without\nfailure, and the vehicle loads can be transmitted from the case (which is usually\npart of the vehicle structure) into the propellant.\n\nWhen the propellant is cured (heated in an oven), it is assumed to have uniform\ninternal temperature and to be free of thermal stresses. As the grain cools and\nshrinks after cure and reaches an equilibrium uniform ambient temperature (say,\nfrom \u201440 to +75\u00b0F), the propellant experiences internal stresses and strains\nwhich can be relatively large at low temperature. The stresses are increased\nbecause the case material usually has a thermal coefficient of expansion that is\nsmaller than that of the propellant by an order of magnitude. The stress-free\ntemperature range of a propellant can be changed by curing the motor under\npressure. Since this usually reduces the stresses at ambient temperature extremes,\nthis pressure cure is now being used more commonly.\n\nThe structural analysis begins when all loads can be identified and quantified.\nTable 12-6 lists typical loads that are experienced by a solid propellant motor\nduring its life cycle and some of the failures they can induce. Some of these loads\nare unique to specific applications. The loads and the timing of these loads during\nthe life cycle of a solid propellant rocket motor have to be analyzed for each\napplication and each motor. They depend on the motor design and use.

The failure cri-\nteria are derived from cumulative damage tests, classical failure theories, actual\nmotor failures, and fracture mechanics. This analysis may be an iterative anal-\nysis, because the materials and geometry need to be changed if analysis shows\nthat the desired margins of safety are exceeded.\n\nIdeally, the analysis would be based on a nonlinear viscoelastic stress theory;\nhowever, such an approach is not yet reliable (see Ref. 12-1). An analysis\nbased on a viscoelastic material behavior is feasible, relatively complex, and\nrequires material property data that are difficult to obtain and uncertain in value.\nMost structural analyses have been based on an elastic material model; it is\nrelatively simple and many two- and three-dimensional finite element analysis\ncomputer programs of this approach are available at rocket motor manufacturing\ncompanies. Admittedly, this theory does not fit all the facts, but with some\nempirical corrections it has given approximate answers to many structural grain\ndesign problems. An example of a two-dimensional finite element grid from a\ncomputer output is shown in Fig. 12\u201422 for a segment of a grain using an elastic\nmodel (see Refs. 12\u201424 and 12-25).\n\nWith elastic materials the stress is essentially proportional to strain and\nindependent of time; when the load is removed, the material returns to its\noriginal condition. Neither of these propositions is valid for grains or their\npropellant materials. In viscoelastic material a time-related dependency exists\nbetween stresses and strains; the relationship is not linear and is influenced by\nthe rate of strain. The stresses are not one-dimensional as many laboratory tests\nare, but three-dimensional, which are more difficult to visualize.

First, the physical\nproperties, including the coefficient of thermal expansion of the case material\nand the propellant, are grossly dissimilar. The coefficient of expansion of a\ntypical solid propellant is 1.0 x 10-* m/m-K, which is five times as great as\nthat of a steel motor case. Secondly, the aft-end and head-end geometries at the\ngrain\u2014case juncture often present a discontinuity, with the grain stress theoret-\nically approaching infinity.

Normally, the\nliner and insulation are much stronger and tougher than the propellant.\n\nParametric studies of propellant and case-bond stresses of a typical grain\u2014case\ntermination design (Fig. 12\u201424) reveal the following:\n\n1. Flap length is less significant than the thickness of the insulation or the\nseparate flap boot, if one is used, in controlling the local level of stresses\nat the grain\u2014case termination.\n\n2. The distribution of stresses at the grain\u2014case termination is sensitive to\nthe local geometry; the level of stress at the case bond increases with web\nfraction and length-to-diameter ratio under loading by internal pressure and\nthermal shrinkage.\n\n3. As the L/D and web fraction increase, the inner-bore hoop stress and\nthe radial stress at the grain\u2014case bond increase more rapidly than does the\ngrain\u2014case termination stress under internal pressure and thermal shrinkage\nloads.\n\n4. The radial case-bond stress level at the grain\u2014case termination is much\nlarger than the case-bond shear stress under axial acceleration loading as\nwell as under internal pressure and thermal shrinkage loading.\n\nAging of propellants in rocket motors refers to their deterioration in the physi-\ncal properties with time. It is caused by the cumulative damage done to the grain\n(such as by thermal cycling, and load applications) during storage, handling, or\ntransport. It can also be caused by chemical changes with time, such as the grad-\nual depletion (evaporation) of certain liquid plasticizers or moisture absorption.\nThe ability to carry stress or to allow elongation in propellants diminishes with\ncumulative damage. The aging limit is the estimated time when the motor is\nno longer able to perform its operation reliably or safely (see Refs. 12\u201428 and\n12-29). Depending on the propellant and the grain design, this age limit or motor\nlife can be betwen 8 and 25 years. Before this limit is reached, the motor should\nbe deactivated and have its propellant removed and replaced. This refurbishing\nof propellant is routinely done on larger and more expensive rocket motors in\nthe military inventory.\n\nWith small tactical rocket motors the aging limit is usually determined by\nfull-scale motor-firing tests at various time periods after manufacture, say 2 or 3\nyears and with an extrapolation to longer time periods. Accelerated temperature\naging (more severe thermal cycles) and accelerated mechanical pulse loads and\noverstressing are often used to reduce the time needed for these tests. For large\nrocket motors, which are more expensive, the number of full-scale tests has to be\nrelatively small, and aging criteria are then developed from structural analysis,\nlaboratory tests, and subscale motor tests.\n",
    "499": "482 SOLID PROPELLANT ROCKET FUNDAMENTALS\n\nMany of the early grains were cartridge loaded and kept the grain isolated\nfrom the motor case to minimize the interrelation of the case and the grain\nstresses and strains resulting from thermal expansion. Also, upon pressuriza-\ntion the case would expand, but the grain would shrink. The case-bonded grain\npresents a far more complex problem in stress analysis. With the propellant grain\nbonded firmly to the case, being a semirubbery and relatively weak material, it\nis forced to respond to case strains. As a result, several critically stressed areas\nexist in every case-bonded motor design; some are shown with an asterisk in\nFig. 12-24.\n\nThe varying nature of the stress analysis problem is brought about by the\nphysical character of propellant; in general terms, solid propellant is relatively\nweak in tension and shear, is semielastic, grows softer and weaker at elevated\ntemperatures, becomes hard and brittle at low temperatures, readily absorbs and\nstores energy upon being vibrated, degrades physically during long-term storage\nbecause of decomposition and chemical or crystalline changes, and accumulates\nstructural damage under load, including cyclic load. This last phenomenon is\nshown graphically in Fig. 12\u201425 and is particularly important in the analysis of\nmotors that are to have a long shelf-life (more than 10 years).\n\nNo a priori reason is known for materials to exhibit cumulative damage, but\npropellants and their bond to case material exhibit this trait even under constant\nload, as shown in Fig. 12\u201426. Valid theories and analytical methods applicable\nto cumulative damage include a consideration of both the stress\u2014strain history\nand the loading path (the material effected).

ATTITUDE CONTROL AND SIDE MANEUVERS WITH SOLID\nPROPELLANT ROCKET MOTORS\n\nA clever attitude control (also called reaction control) system with solid propel-\nlants is used on some ballistic missiles. Its hot reaction gas has a low enough\ntemperature so that uncooled hardware can be used for long durations. Ammo-\nnium nitrate composite propellant (mentioned as gas generator propellants in\nTables 13\u20141 and 13-2) or a propellant consisting of a nitramine (RDX or HMX,\ndescribed in Chapter 13) with a polymer binding are suitable. The version shown\nschematically in Fig. 12-27 provides pitch and yaw control see Chapter 18; hot\ngas flows continuously through insulated manifolds, open hot gas valves, and all\nfour nozzles. When one of these valves is closed, it causes an unbalance of gas\nflow and produces a side force. The chamber pressure rises when the value is\nclosed. To keep things simple, the four roll-control thrusters have been deleted\nfrom this figure.\n",

Simplified diagram of a rocket attitude control system using solid pro-\npellant. All four valves are normally open and gas flows equally through all nozzles.\n\nWith this type of attitude control system it is possible to achieve variable\nduration thrust pulsing operations and random pitch, yaw, and roll maneuvers. It\nis competitive with multithruster liquid propellant attitude control systems. The\nsolid propellant versions are usually heavier because they have heavy insulated\nhardware and require more propellant (for continuous gas flow), whereas the\nliquid version is operated only when attitude control motions are required.\n\nA similar approach with hot gas valves applies to upper stages of interceptor\nvehicles used for missile defense; there is little time available for maneuvers\nof the upper stage to reach the incoming missile or aircraft and therefore the\nburning durations are usually short. The solid propellant gas temperatures are\nhigher than with gas generators (typically 1260\u00b0C or 2300\u00b0F), but lower than with\ntypical composite propellants (3050 K or 5500\u00b0F), and this allows the valves and\nmanifolds to be made of high-temperature material (such as rhenium or carbon).\nIn addition to attitude control, the system provides a substantial side force or\ndivert thrust. It displaces the flight path laterally. Figure 12-28 shows such a\nsystem. Since all hot gas valves are normally open, a valve has to be closed\nto obtain a thrust force as explained in the previous figure. The attitude control\nsystem provides pitch, yaw, and roll control to stabilize the vehicle during its\nflight, to orient the divert nozzle into the desired direction, and sometimes to\norient the seeker (at the front of the vehicle) toward the target. Thrust vector\ncontrol is treated in Chapter 18.\n",

In\nthis chapter we describe several common solid rocket propellants, their principal\ncategories, ingredients, hazards, manufacturing processes, and quality control. We\nalso discuss liners and insulators, propellants for igniters, tailoring of propellants,\nand propellants for gas generators.\n\nThermochemical analyses are needed to characterize the performance of a\ngiven propellant. The analysis methods are described in Chapter 5. Such analyses\nprovide theoretical values of average molecular mass, combustion temperature,\naverage specific heat ratio, and the characteristic velocity; they are functions of\nthe propellant composition and chamber pressure. Specific impulse can also be\ncomputed for a particular nozzle configuration.\n\nThe term solid propellant has several connotations, including: (1) the rubbery\nor plastic-like mixture of oxidizer, fuel, and other ingredients that have been\nprocessed and constitute the finished grain; (2) the processed but uncured product;\n(3) a single ingredient, such as the fuel or the oxidizer. Acronyms and chemical\nsymbols are used indiscriminately as abbreviations for propellant and ingredient\nnames; only some of these will be used here.\n\n13.1. CLASSIFICATION\n\nProcessed modern propellants can be classified in several ways, as described\nbelow. This classification is not rigorous or complete. Sometimes the same pro-\npellant will fit into two or more of the classifications.\n\n492\n",
    "510": "13.1. CLASSIFICATION 493\n\n1. Propellants are often tailored to and classified by specific applications,\n\nsuch as space launch booster propellants or tactical missile propellants;\neach has somewhat specific chemical ingredients, different burning rates,\ndifferent physical properties, and different performance. Table 12\u20141 shows\nfour kinds of rocket motor applications (each has somewhat different pro-\npellants) and several gas generator applications. Propellants for rocket\nmotors have hot (over 2400 K) gases and are used to produce thrust, but\ngas generator propellants have lower-temperature combustion gases (800\nto 1200 K) and they are used to produce power, not thrust.\nHistorically, the early rocket motor propellants used to be grouped into two\nclasses: double-base (DB)* propellants were used as the first production\npropellants, and then the development of polymers as binders made the\ncomposite propellants feasible.\n\n2. Double-base (DB) propellants form a homogeneous propellant grain, usu-\nally a nitrocellulose (NC)*, a solid ingredient which absorbs liquid nitro-\nglycerine (NG) plus minor percentages of additives. Both the major ingre-\ndients are explosives and function as a combined fuel and oxidizer. Both\nextruded double-base (EDB) and cast double-base (CDB) propellant have\nfound extensive applications, mostly in small tactical missiles of older\ndesign. By adding crystalline nitramines (HMX or RDX)* the perfor-\nmance and density can be improved; this is sometimes called cast-modified\ndouble-base propellant. A further improvement is to add an elastomeric\nbinder (rubber-like, such as crosslinked polybutadiene), which improves the\nphysical properties and allows more nitramine and thus improves the per-\nformance slightly. The resulting propellant is called elastomeric-modified\ncast double-base (EMCDB). These four classes of double base have nearly\nsmokeless exhausts. Adding some solid ammonium perchlorate (AP) and\naluminum (Al) increases the density and the specific impulse slightly, but\nthe exhaust gas is smoky. The propellant is called composite-modified\ndouble-base propellant or CMDB.\n\n3. Composite propellants form a heterogeneous propellant grain with the oxi-\ndizer crystals and a powdered fuel (usually aluminum) held together in\na matrix of synthetic rubber (or plastic) binder, such as polybutadiene\n(HTPB)*. Composite propellants are cast from a mix of solid (AP crys-\ntals, Al powder)* and liquid (HTPB, PPG)* ingredients. The propellant is\nhardened by crosslinking or curing the liquid binder polymer with a small\namount of curing agent, and curing it in an oven, where it becomes hard\nand solid. In the past three decades the composite propellants have been\nthe most commonly used class. They can be further subdivided:\n\n(a) Conventional composite propellants usually contain between 60 and\n\n72% AP as crystalline oxidizer, up to 22% Al powder as a metal fuel,\n\n*Acronyms, symbols, abbreviations, and chemical names of propellant ingredients are explained in\nTables 13-6 and 13-7 in Section 13.4.\n",

Sometimes HMX is also added.\n\n(d) A high-energy composite solid propellant (with some aluminum),\nwhere the organic elastomeric binder and plasticizer are largely\nreplaced by energetic materials (such as certain explosives) and where\nsome of the AP is replaced by HMX. Some of these are called\nelastomer-modified cast double-base propellants (EMCDB). Most\nare experimental propellants. The theoretical specific impulse can be\nbetween 270 and 275 sec at standard conditions.\n\n(e) A lower-energy composite propellant, where ammonium nitrate (AN) is\nthe crystalline oxidizer (no AP). It is used for gas generator propellant.\nIf a large amount of HMX is added, it can become a minimum smoke\npropellant with fair performance.\n\nFigures 13-1 and 13-2 show the general regions for the specific impulse,\nburning rate, and density for the more common classes of propellants.\nComposite propellants give higher densities, specific impulse, and a wider\nrange of burning rates. The ordinate in these figures is an actual or estimated\nspecific impulse at standard conditions (1000 psi and expansion to sea-level\natmosphere). It does not include any pressure drops in the chamber, any\nnozzle erosion, or an assumption about combustion losses and scaling.\nThe composite propellants are shown to have a wide range of burning\nrates and densities; most of them have specific gravities between 1.75\nand 1.81 and burning rates between 7 and 20 mm/sec. Table 13-1 lists\nperformance characteristics for several propellants. The DB propellants and\nthe AN propellants have lower performance and density. Most composite\npropellants have almost the same performance and density but a wide range\nof burning rates. The highest performance is for a CMDB propellant whose\ningredients are identified as DB/AP-HMX/AI, but it is only 4% higher.\n\nSeveral of the classifications can be confusing. The term composite-\n\nmodified double-base propellant (CMDB) has been used for (1) a DB\n\npropellant, where some AP, Al, and binder are added; (2) alternatively,\nthe same propellant could be classified as a composite propellant to which\nsome double-base ingredients have been added.\n\n4. Propellants can be classified by the density of the smoke in the exhaust\nplume as smoky, reduced smoke, or minimum smoke (essentially smokeless).\nAluminum powder, a desirable fuel ingredient, is oxidized to aluminum\noxide, which forms visible small solid smoke particles in the exhaust gas.\nMost composite propellants are smoky.

Carbon\n(soot) particles and metal oxides, such as zirconium oxide or iron oxide,\ncan also be visible if in high enough concentration. This is further discussed\nin Chapter 20.\n\n5. The safety rating for detonation can distinguish propellants as a potentially\ndetonable material (class 1.1) or as a nondetonable material (class 1.3), as\ndescribed in Section 13.3. Examples of class 1.1 propellant are a number of\ndouble-base propellants and composite propellants containing a significant\nportion of solid explosive (e.g., HMX or RDX), together with certain other\ningredients.\n\n6. Propellants can be classified by some of the principal manufacturing pro-\ncesses that are used. Cast propellant is made by mechanical mixing of solid\nand liquid ingredients, followed by casting and curing; it is the most com-\nmon process for composite propellants. Curing of many cast propellants is\nby chemical reaction between binder and curing agent at elevated temper-\nature (45 to 150\u00b0C); however, there are some that can be cured at ambient\ntemperatures (20 to 25\u00b0C) or hardened by a nonchemical process such as\n",

    "515": "498 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\nA large variety of different chemical ingredients and propellant formulations\nhave been synthesized, analyzed, and tested in experimental motors. Later we\nlist many of them. Perhaps only 12 basic types of propellant are in common\nuse today. Other types are still being investigated. Table 13-2 evaluates some\nof the advantages and disadvantages of several selected propellant classes. A\ntypical propellant has between 4 and 12 different ingredients. Representative\nformulations for three types of propellant are given in Table 13-3. In actual\npractice, each manufacturer of a propellant has his own precise formulation and\nprocessing procedure. The exact percentages of ingredients, even for a given\npropellant such as PBAN, not only vary among manufacturers but often vary\nfrom motor application to motor application. The practice of adjusting the mass\npercentage and even adding or deleting one or more of the minor ingredients\n(additives) is known as propellant tailoring. Tailoring is the practice of taking a\nwell-known propellant and changing it slightly to fit a new application, different\nprocessing equipment, altered motor ballistics, storage life, temperature limits, or\neven a change in ingredient source.\n\nNew propellant formulations are normally developed using laboratory-size\nmixers, curing ovens, and related apparatus with the propellant mixers (1 to\n5 liters) operated by remote control for safety reasons. Process studies usually\naccompany the development of the formulation to evaluate the \u201cprocessibility\u201d\nof a new propellant and to guide the design of any special production equipment\nneeded in preparing ingredients, mixing, casting, or curing the propellant.\n\nHistorically, black powder (a pressed mixture of potassium nitrate, sulfur, and\nan organic fuel such as ground peach stones) was the first to be used. Other\ntypes of ingredients and propellants have been used in experimental motors,\nincluding fluorine compounds, propellants containing powdered beryllium, boron,\nhydrides of boron, lithium, or beryllium, or new synthetic organic plasticizer and\nbinder materials with azide or nitrate groups. Most have not yet been considered\nsatisfactory or practical for production in rocket motors.\n\n13.2. PROPELLANT CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe propellant selection is critical to rocket motor design. The desirable propel-\nlant characteristics are listed below and are discussed again in other parts of this\nbook. The requirements for any particular motor will influence the priorities of\nthese characteristics:\n\n1. High performance or high specific impulse; this really means high gas\n\ntemperature and/or low gas molecular mass.\n\n2. Predictable, reproducible, and initially adjustable burning rate to fit the\n\nneed of the grain design and the thrust\u2014time requirement.\n\n3. For minimum variation in thrust or chamber pressure, the pressure or burn-\n\ning rate exponent and the temperature coefficient should be small.\n",

It shows how the specific impulse varies with changes in the\ncomposition of the three principal ingredients: the solid AP, solid Al, and\nviscoelastic polymer binder.\n\nFor DB propellant the variations of J; and 7; are shown in Figs. 13-1\nand 13-5 as a function of the NG or plasticizer percentage. The theoretical\nmaximum specific impulse occurs at about 80% NG. In practice, nitroglycerine,\nwhich is a liquid, is seldom found in concentrations over 60% because the phys-\nical properties are poor if NG is high. Other major solid or soluble ingredients\nare needed to make a usable DB propellant.\n\nFor CMDB propellant the addition of either AP or a reactive nitramine such\nas RDX allows a higher J, than ordinary DB (where AP or RDX percent is\nzero), as shown in Fig. 13-6.

Not all apply to each propellant.\nInadvertent Ignition\n\nIf a rocket motor is ignited and starts combustion when it is not expected to do so,\nthe consequences can include very hot gases, local fires, or ignition of adjacent\nrocket motors. Unless the motor is constrained or fastened down, its thrust will\nsuddenly accelerate it to unanticipated high velocities or erratic flight paths that\ncan cause damage. Its exhaust cloud can be toxic and corrosive. Inadvertent\nignition can be caused by these effects:\n\nStray or induced currents activate the igniter.\n\nElectrostatic charging causes a spark or arc discharge.\n\nFires can cause excessive heating of motor exterior, which can raise the pro-\n\npellant temperature above the ignition point.\n\nImpact (bullet penetration or dropping the motor onto a hard surface).\n\nEnergy absorption from prolonged mechanical vibration can cause the propel-\n\nlant to overheat.\n\nRadiation from a nuclear explosion.\n\nAn electromechanical system is usually provided that prevents stray currents\nfrom activating the igniter; it is called safe and arm system. It prevents ignition\ninduced by currents in other wires of the vehicle, radar- or radio-frequency-\ninduced currents, electromagnetic surges, or pulses from a nuclear bomb explo-\nsion. It prevents electric currents from reaching the igniter circuit during its\n\u201cunarmed\u201d condition. When put into the \u201carm\u201d position, it is ready to accept and\ntransmit the start signal to the igniter.\n\nElectrostatic discharges (ESD) can be caused by lightning, friction of insu-\nlating materials, or the moving separation of two insulators. The buildup of a\nhigh electrostatic potential of thousands of volts can, upon discharge, allow a\nrapid increase in electric current, which in turn can lead to arcing or exother-\nmic reactions along the current\u2019s path. For this reason all propellants, liners, or\ninsulators should have sufficient electric conductivity to prevent the buildup of\nan electrostatic charge. The inadvertent ignition of a Pershing ground-to-ground\nmissile is believed to have been caused by an electrostatic discharge while in the\ntransporter-erector vehicle. ESD is a function of the materials, their surface and\nvolume resistivities, dielectric constants, and the breakdown voltages.\n\nViscoelastic propellants are excellent absorbers of vibration energy and can\nbecome locally hot when oscillated for extensive periods at particular frequencies.\nThis can happen in designs where a segment of the grain is not well supported\nand is free to vibrate at natural frequencies. A propellant can also be accidentally\nignited by various other energy inputs, such as mechanical friction or bullet\nimpact, or accidentally dropping a motor. Standard tests have been developed to\n",
    "524": "13.3. HAZARDS 507\nmeasure the propellant\u2019s resistance to these energy inputs. Considerable effort\nhas been spent in developing new propellants which resist these energy inputs.\nAging and Useful Life\nThis topic was discussed briefly in the section on Structural Design in the pre-\nvious chapter. The aging of a propellant can be measured with test motors and\npropellant sample tests if the loading during the life of the motor can be correctly\nanticipated. It is then possible to estimate and predict the useful shelf or storage\nlife of a rocket motor (see Refs. 13-5 and 13-6). When a reduction in physical\nproperties, caused by estimated thermal or mechanical load cycles (cumulative\ndamage), has reduced the safety margin on the stresses and/or strains to a danger\npoint, the motor is no longer considered to be safe to ignite and operate. Once\nthis age limit or its predicted, weakened condition is reached, the motor has a\nhigh probability of failure. It needs to be pulled from the ready inventory, and\nthe old aged propellant needs to be removed and replaced.\n\nThe /ife of a particular motor depends on the particular propellants, the fre-\nquency and magnitude of imposed loads or strains, the design, and other factors.\nTypical life values range from 5 to 25 years. Shelf life can usually be increased\nby increasing the physical strength of the propellants (e.g., by increasing the\namount of binder), selecting chemically compatible, stable ingredients with min-\nimal long-term degradation, or by minimizing the vibration loads, temperature\nlimits, or number of cycles (controlled storage and transport environment).\nCase Overpressure and Failure\nThe motor case will break or explode if the chamber pressure exceeds the case\u2019s\nburst pressure. The release of high-pressure gas energy can cause an explosion;\nmotor pieces could be thrown out into the adjacent area. The sudden depressur-\nization from chamber pressure to ambient pressure, which is usually below the\ndeflagration limit, would normally cause a class 1.3 propellant to stop burning.\nLarge pieces of unburned propellant can often be found after a violent case burst.\nThis type of motor failure can be caused by one of the following:\n\n1. The grain is overaged, porous, or severely cracked and/or has major\n\nunbonded areas due to severe accumulated damage.\n\n2. There has been a significant chemical change in the propellant due to migra-\ntion or slow, low-order chemical reactions. This can reduce the allowable\nphysical properties, weakening the grain, so that it will crack or cause\nunfavorable increases in the burning rate. In some cases chemical reac-\ntions create gaseous products which create many small voids and raise the\npressure in sealed stored motors.\n\n3. The motor has not properly been manufactured. Obviously, careful fabri-\ncation and inspection are necessary.\n",
    "525": "508 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\n4. The motor has been damaged. For example, a nick or dent in the case\ncaused by improper handling will reduce the case strength. This can be\nprevented by careful handling and repeated inspections.\n\n5. All obstruction plugs the nozzle (e.g., a loose large piece of insulation) and\ncauses a rapid increase in chamber pressure.\n\n6. Moisture absorption can degrade the strength and strain capabilities by a\nfactor of 3 to 10 in propellants that contain hygroscopic ingredients. Motors\nare usually sealed to prevent humid air access.\n\nDetonation versus Deflagration. When burning rocket motor propellant is\noverpressurized, it can either deflagrate (or burn) or detonate (explode violently),\nas described in Table 13-4. In a detonation the chemical reaction energy of\nthe whole grain can be released in a very short time (microseconds), and in\neffect it becomes an exploding bomb. This detonation condition can happen\nwith some propellants and some ingredients (e.g, nitroglycerine or HMX, which\nTABLE 13-4.

    "526": "13.3. HAZARDS 509\nare described later in this chapter). Detonations can be minimized or totally\navoided by proper design, correct manufacture, and safe handling and operating\nprocedures.\n\nThe same material may either burn or detonate depending on the chemical\n\nformulation, the type and intensity of the initiation, the degree of confinement,\nthe physical propellant properties (such as density or porosity), and the geomet-\nric characteristics of the motor. It is possible for certain propellants to change\nsuddenly from an orderly deflagration to a detonation. A simplified explanation\nof this transition starts with normal burning at rated chamber pressure; the hot\ngas then penetrates pores or small cracks in the unburned propellant, where the\nlocal confinement can cause the pressure to become very high locally, the com-\nbustion front speeds up to shock wave speed with a low-pressure differential, and\nit then accelerates further to a strong, fast, high-pressure shock wave, character-\nistic of detonations. The degree and rigidity of the geometric confinement and a\nscale factor (e.g., larger-diameter grain) influence the severity and occurrence of\ndetonations.\nHazard Classification. Propellants that can experience a transition from defla-\ngration to detonation are considered more hazardous and are usually designated\nas class |.1-type propellants. Most propellants will burn, the case may burst if\nchamber pressure becomes too high, but the propellant will not detonate and are\nclass 1.3 propellants. The required tests and rules for determining this hazard\ncategory are explained in Ref. 13\u20147. Propellant samples are subjected to various\ntests, including impact tests (dropped weight) and card gap tests (which determine\nthe force needed to initiate a propellant detonation when a sample is subjected\nto a blast from a known booster explosive). If the case should burst violently\nwith a class 1.3 propellant, much of the remaining unburnt propellant would be\nthrown out, but would then usually stop burning. With a class 1.1 propellant, a\npowerful detonation can sometimes ensue, which rapidly gasifies all the remain-\ning propellant, and is much more powerful and destructive than the bursting of\nthe case under high pressure. Unfortunately, the term \u201cexplosion\u201d has been used\nto describe both a bursting of a case with its fragmentation of the motor and also\nthe higher rate of energy release of a detonation, which leads to a very rapid and\nmore energetic fragmentation of the motor.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) classification of 1.1 or 1.3 determines the\nmethod of labeling and the cost of shipping rocket propellants, loaded military\nmissiles, explosives, or ammunition; it also determines the required limits on\nthe amount of that propellant stored or manufactured in any one site and the\nminimum separation distance of that site to the next building or site. The DOD\nsystem (Ref. 13-7) is the same as that used by the United Nations.\nInsensitive Munitions\nIn military operations an accidental ignition and unplanned operation or an explo-\nsion of a rocket missile can cause severe damage to equipment and injure or kill\n",
    "527": "510 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\npersonnel. This has to be avoided or minimized by making the motor designs\nand propellants insensitive to a variety of energy stimuli. The worst scenario\nis a detonation of the propellant, releasing the explosive energy of all of the\npropellant mass, and this scenario is to be avoided. The missiles and its motors\nmust undergo a series of prescribed tests to determine their resistance to inadver-\ntent ignition with the most likely energy inputs during a possible battle situation.\nTable 13\u20145 describes a series of tests called out in a military specification, which\nare detailed in Refs. 13-8 and 13-9. A threat hazard assessment must be made\nprior to the tests, to evaluate the logistic and operational threats during the mis-\nsile\u2019s life cycle. This may result in modifications to the test setups, changes in\nthe passing criteria, or the skipping of some of these tests.\n\nThe missiles, together with their motors, are destroyed in these tests. If the\nmotor should detonate (an unacceptable result), the motor has to be redesigned\nand/or have a change in propellant. There are some newer propellants that are\nmore resistant to these stimuli and are therefore preferred for tactical missile\napplications, even though there is usually a penalty in propulsion performance. If\nexplosions (not detonations) occur, it may be possible to redesign the motor and\nmitigate the effects of the explosion (make it less violent). For example, the case\ncan have a provision to vent itself prior to an explosion. Changes to the shipping\ncontainer can also mitigate some of these effects. If the result is a fire (an accept-\nable result), it should be confined to the particular grain or motor. Under some\ncircumstances a burst failure of the case is acceptable. A new class of insensitive\npropellants has been developed with new types of binders in the past decade.\nTheir purpose remains to minimize any drastic consequences (such as detona-\ntion) when the motor is exposed to various unexpected energetic stimuli, such as\nTABLE 13-5.

Recently, these\npropellants have been selected for production with military missions, reflecting\nan important milestone in propellant development. The leading example is a new\ncomposite propellant with HTPE (hydroxyl-terminated polyether) as the binder\ndeveloped by ATK Launch Systems, see Ref. 13-10. HTPE has been qualified\nand applied to the MK 134 rocket motor for the ship-launched Evolved Sea Spar-\ntow Missile (ESSM). This motor is co-manufactured by ATK in the United States\nand NAMMO Raufoss in Norway for member nations of the NATO Sea Spar-\nrow Consortium. A relatively insensitive propellant has also been developed in\nFrance, namely, a nonmigrating ferrocene-grafted HTPB binder called Butacene.\nIt has been qualified for a few systems in the United States and other countries;\nsee Ref. 13-10.\n\nUpper Pressure Limit\nIf the pressure-rise rate and the absolute pressure become sufficiently high (as in\nsome impact tests or in the high acceleration of a gun barrel), some propellants\nwill detonate. For many propellants these pressures are above approximately 1500\nMPa or 225,000 psi, but for others they are lower (as low as 300 MPa or 45,000\npsi). These values represent an upper pressure limit beyond which a propellant\nshould not operate.\nToxicity\nA large share of all rockets do not have a significant toxicity problem. A num-\nber of propellant ingredients (e.g., some crosslinking agents and burning rate\ncatalysts) and a few of the plastics used in fiber-reinforced cases can be derma-\ntological or respiratory toxins; a few are carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) or\nsuspected carcinogens. They, and the mixed uncured propellant containing these\nmaterials, have to be handled carefully to prevent operator exposure. This means\nusing gloves, face shields, good ventilation, and, with some high-vapor-pressure\ningredients, gas masks. The finished or cured grain or motor is usually not toxic.\nThe exhaust plume gases can be very toxic if they contain beryllium or\nberylium oxide particles, chlorine gas, hydrochloric acid gas, hydrofluoric acid\ngas, or some other fluorine compounds. When an ammonium perchlorate oxidizer\nis used, the exhaust gas can contain up to about 14% hydrochloric acid which is a\ntoxic gas. For large rocket motors this can be many tons of highly toxic gas. Test\nand launch facilities for rockets with toxic plumes require special precautions\nand occasionally decontamination processes, as explained in Chapter 21.\nSafety Rules\nThe most effective way to control hazards and prevent accidents is (1) to train\npersonnel in the hazards of each propellant of concern and to teach them how\nto avoid hazardous conditions, prevent accidents, and how to recover from an\n",
    "529": "512 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\naccident; (2) to design the motors, facilities, and the equipment to be safe; and\n(3) to institute and enforce rigid safety rules during design, manufacture, and\noperation. There are many such rules. Examples are no smoking and no matches\nin areas where there are propellants or loaded motors, wearing spark-proof shoes\nand using spark-proof tools, shielding all electrical equipment, providing a water-\ndeluge fire extinguishing system in test facilities to cool motors or extinguish\nburning, or proper grounding of all electrical equipment and items that could\nbuild up static electrical charges.\n\n13.4. PROPELLANT INGREDIENTS\n\nA number of relatively common propellant ingredients are listed in Table 13-6\nfor double-base propellants and in Table 13-7 for composite-type solid pro-\npellants. They are categorized by major function, such as oxidizer, fuel, binder,\nplasticizer, curing agent, and so on, and each category is described in this section.\nHowever, several of the ingredients have more than one function. These lists are\nnot complete and at least 200 other ingredients have been tried in experimental\nrocket motors.\n\nA classification of modern propellants, including some new types that are still\nin the experimental phase, is given in Table 13-8, according to their binders,\nplasticizers, and solid ingredients; these solids may be an oxidizer, a solid fuel,\nor a combination or compound of both.\n\nThe ingredient properties and impurities can have a profound effect on the\npropellant characteristics. A seemingly minor change in one ingredient can cause\nmeasurable changes in ballistic properties, physical properties, migration, aging,\nor ease of manufacture. When the propellant\u2019s performance or ballistic char-\nacteristics have tight tolerances, the ingredient purity and properties must also\nconform to tight tolerances and careful handling (e.g., no exposure to moisture).\nIn the remainder of this section a number of the important ingredients, grouped\nby function, are briefly, discussed.\n\nInorganic Oxidizers\n\nSome of the thermochemical properties of several oxidizers and oxygen radical-\ncontaining compounds are listed in Table 13\u20149. Their values depend on the\nchemical nature of each ingredient.\n\nAmmonium perchlorate (NH4C1O4) is the most widely used crystalline oxi-\ndizer in solid propellants. Because of its good characteristics, including compati-\nbility with other propellant materials, good performance, quality, uniformity, and\navailability, it dominates the solid oxidizer field. Other solid oxidizers, particu-\nlarly ammonium nitrate and potassium perchlorate, were used and occasionally\nare still being used in production rockets but to a large extent have been replaced\nby more modern propellants containing ammonium perchlorate. Many oxidizer\ncompounds were investigated during the 1970s, but none reached production\nstatus.\n",

Ammonium\nperchlorate (AP) is supplied in the form of small white crystals. Particle size\nand shape influences the manufacturing process and the propellant burning rate.\nTherefore, close control of the crystal sizes and the size distribution present\nin a given quantity or batch is required. AP crystals are rounded (nearly ball\nshaped) to allow easier mixing than sharp, fractured crystals. They come in sizes\nranging from about 600 um (1 um = 10~\u00b0m) diameter to about 80 um from the\nfactory. Sizes below about 40 um diameter are considered hazardous (can easily\nbe ignited and sometimes detonated) and are not shipped; instead, the propellant\nmanufacturer takes larger crystals and grinds them (at the motor factory) to the\nsmaller sizes (down to 2 Um) just before they are incorporated into a propellant.\nThe inorganic nitrates are relatively low-performance oxidizers compared with\nperchlorates. However, ammonium nitrate is used in some applications because\nof its very low cost and smokeless and relatively nontoxic exhaust. Its principal\nuse is with low-burning-rate, low-performance rocket and gas generator appli-\ncations. Ammonium nitrate (AN) changes its crystal structure at several phase\ntransformation temperatures. These changes cause slight changes in volume. One\nphase transformation at 32\u00b0C causes about a 3.4% change in volume. Repeated\ntemperature cycling through this transition temperature creates tiny voids in the\npropellant, and causes growth in the grain and a change in physical or ballistic\nproperties. The addition of a small amount of stabilizer such as nickel oxide (NiO)\nor potassium nitrate (KNO3) seems to change the transition temperature to above\n60\u00b0C, a high enough value so that normal ambient temperature cycling will no\nlonger cause recrystallization (Refs. 13-11 and 13-12). AN with such an addi-\ntive is known as phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN). AN is hygroscopic,\nand the absorption of moisture will degrade propellant made with AN.\n",

It consists of small spherical particles (5 to 60 um diameter) and\nis used in a wide variety of composite and composite-modified double-base pro-\npellant formulations, usually constituting 14 to 20% of the propellant by weight.\nSmall aluminum particles can burn in air and this powder is mildly toxic if\ninhaled. During rocket combustion this fuel is oxidized into aluminum oxide.\nThese oxide particles tend to agglomerate and form larger particles. Aluminum\nincreases the heat of combustion, the propellant density, the combustion temper-\nature, and thus the specific impulse. The oxide is in liquid droplet form during\ncombustion and solidifies in the nozzle as the gas temperature drops. When in the\nliquid state the oxide can form a molten slag which can accumulate in pockets\n(e.g., around an impropely designed submerged nozzle), thus adversely affect-\ning the vehicle\u2019s mass ratio. It also can deposit on walls inside the combustion\nchamber, as described in Refs. 13-13 and 13-14.\n\nBoron is a high-energy fuel that is lighter than aluminum and has a high\nmelting point (2304\u00b0C). It is difficult to burn with high efficiency in combustion\nchambers of reasonable length. However, it can be oxidized at reasonable effi-\nciency if the boron particle size is very small. Boron is used advantageously as\na propellant in combination rocket-air-burning engines, where there is adequate\ncombustion volume and oxygen from the air.\n\nBeryllium burns much more easily than boron and improves the specific\nimpulse of a solid propellant motor, by about 15 sec, but it and its oxide are highly\ntoxic powders absorbed by animals and humans when inhaled. The technology\nwith composite propellants using powdered beryllium fuel has been experimen-\ntally proven, but its severe toxicity makes any application unlikely.\n",
    "535": "518 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\nTheoretically, both aluminum hydride (AlH3) and beryllium hydride (BeH2)\nare attractive fuels because of their high heat release and gas-volume contribution.\nSpecific impulse gains are 10 to 15 sec for AloH3 and 25 to 30 sec for BeHo.\nBoth are difficult to manufacture and both deteriorate chemically during storage,\nwith loss of hydrogen. These compounds are not used today in practical fuels.\nBinders\nThe binder provides the structural glue or matrix in which solid granular ingre-\ndients are held together in a composite propellant. The raw materials are liquid\nprepolymers or monomers. Polyethers, polyesters, and poly-butadienes have been\nused (see Tables 13-6 and 13-7). After they are mixed with the solid ingredi-\nents, cast and cured, they form a hard rubber-like material that constitutes the\ngrain. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PU) (Table 13-1) were used\n50 years ago and are still used in a few motors, mostly of old design. Binder\nmaterials are also really fuels for solid propellant rockets and are oxidized in the\ncombustion process. The binding ingredient, usually a polymer of one type or\nanother, has a primary effect on motor reliability, mechanical properties, propel-\nlant processing complexity, storability, aging, and costs. Some polymers undergo\ncomplex chemical reactions, crosslinking, and branch chaining during curing\nof the propellant. HTPB has been the favorite binder in recent years, because\nit allows a somewhat higher solids fraction (88 to 90% of AP and Al) and\nrelatively good physical properties at the temperature limits. Several common\nbinders are listed in Tables 13-1, 13-6, and 13\u20147. Elastomeric binders have\nbeen added to plasticized double-base-type nitrocellulose to improve physical\nproperties. Polymerization occurs when the binder monomer and its crosslinking\nagent react (beginning in the mixing process) to form long-chain and complex\nthree-dimensional polymers. Other types of binders, such as PVC, cure or plas-\nticize without a molecular reaction (see Refs. 13-2, 13-3, and 13-14). Often\ncalled plastisol-type binders, they form a very viscous dispersion of a powdered\npolymerized resin in nonvolatile liquid; they polymerize slowly.\nBurning-Rate Modifiers\nA burning-rate catalyst or burning-rate modifier helps to accelerate or decelerate\nthe combustion at the burning surface and increases or decreases the propellant\nburning rate. It permits the tailoring of the burning rate to fit a specific grain\ndesign and thrust\u2014time curve. Several are listed in Tables 13-6 and 13-7. Some,\nlike iron oxide or lead stearate, increase the burning rate; however, others, like\nlithium fluoride, will reduce the burning rate of some composite propellants.\nThe inorganic catalysts do not contribute to the combustion energy, but consume\nenergy when they are heated to the combustion temperature. These modifiers are\neffective because they change the combustion mechanism, which is described in\nChapter 14 (Chapter 2 of Ref. 13-2 gives examples of modifiers that change the\nburning rate of composite propellants).\n",
    "536": "13.4. PROPELLANT INGREDIENTS 519\n\nPlasticizers\nA plasticizer is usually a relatively low-viscosity liquid organic ingredient which\nis also a fuel. It is added to improve the elongation of the propellant at low\ntemperatures and to improve processing properties, such as lower viscosity for\ncasting or longer pot life of the mixed but uncured propellants. The plasticizers\nlisted in Tables 13-6, 13-7, and 13-8 show several examples.\nCuring Agents or Crosslinkers\nA curing agent or crosslinker causes the prepolymers to form longer chains of\nlarger molecular mass and interlocks between chains. Even though these materials\nare present in small amounts (0.2 to 3%), a minor change in the percentage will\nhave a major effect on the propellant physical properties, manufacturability, and\naging. They are used only with composite propellants and are the ingredient that\ncauses the binder to solidify and become hard. Several curing agents are listed\nin Table 13-7.\nEnergetic Binders and Plasticizers\nEnergetic binders and/or plasticizers are used in lieu of the conventional organic\nmaterials. They contain oxidizing species (such as azides or organic nitrates) as\nwell as organic species. They add some additional energy to the propellant caus-\ning a modest increase in performance. They serve also as a binder to hold other\ningredients, or as an energetic plasticizer liquid. They can self-react exother-\nmally and burn without a separate oxidizer. Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) is an\nexample of an energetic, thermally stable, hydroxyl-terminated prepolymer that\ncan be polymerized. It has been used in experiental propellants. Other energetic\nbinder or plasticizer materials are listed in Tables 13-6, 13-7, and 13-8.\nOrganic Oxidizers or Explosives\nOrganic oxidizers are explosive organic compounds with\u2014NOp radical or other\noxidizing fractions incorporated into the molecular structure. References 13-2\nand 13-14 describe their properties, manufacture, and application. These are used\nwith high-energy propellants or smokeless propellants. They can be crystalline\nsolids, such as the nitramines HMX or RDX, fibrous solids such as NC, or\nenergetic plasticizer liquids such as DEGN or NG. These materials can react\nor burn by themselves when initiated with enough activating energy, but all\nof them can be detonated under certain conditions. Both HMX and RDX are\nstoichiometrically balanced materials and the addition of either fuel or oxidizer\nonly will reduce the 7; and J; values. Therefore, when binder fuels are added to\nhold the HMX or RDX crystals in a viscoelastic matrix, it is also necessary to\nadd an oxidizer such as AP or AN.\n\nRDX and HMX are quite similar in structure and properties. Both are white\ncrystalline solids that can be made in different sizes. For safety, they are shipped\n",
    "537": "520 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\nin a desensitizing liquid, which has to be removed prior to propellant processing.\nHMxX has a higher density, a higher detonation rate, yields more energy per unit\nvolume, and has a higher melting point. NG, NC, HMX, and RDX are also used\nextensively in military and commercial explosives. HMX or RDX can be included\nin DB, CMDB, or composite propellants to achieve higher performance or other\ncharacteristics. The percentage added can range up to 60% of the propellant.\nProcessing propellant with these or similar ingredients can be hazardous, and the\nextra safety precautions make the processing more expensive.\n\nLiquid nitroglycerine (NG) by itself is very sensitive to shock, impact, or\nfriction. It is an excellent plasticizer for propellants when desensitized by the\naddition of other liquids (like triacetin or dibutyl phthalate) or by compounding\nwith nitrocellulose. It readily dissolves in many organic solvents, and in turn it\nacts as a solvent for NC and other solid ingredients (Ref. 13-14).\n\nNitrocellulose (NC) is a key ingredient in DB and CMDB propellant. It is\nmade by the acid nitration of natural cellulose fibers from wood or cotton and\nis a mixture of several organic nitrates. Although crystalline, it retains the fiber\nstructure of the original cellulose (see Ref. 13-14). The nitrogen content is\nimportant in defining the significant properties of nitrocellulose and can range\nfrom 8 to 14%, but the grades used for propellant are usually between 12.2 and\n13.1%. Since it is impossible to make NC from natural products with an exact\nnitrogen content, the required properties are achieved by careful blending. Since\nthe solid fiber-like NC material is difficult to make into a grain, it is usually\nmixed with NG, DEGN, or other plasticizer to gelatinize or solvate it when used\nwith DB and CMDB propellant.\n\nAdditives\n\nSmall amounts of additives are used for many purposes, including accelerating\nor lengthening the curing time, improving the rheological properties (easier cast-\ning of viscous raw mixed propellant), improving the physical properties , adding\nopaqueness to a transparent propellant to prevent radiation heating at places other\nthan the burning surface, limiting migration of chemical species from the pro-\npellant to the binder or vice versa, minimizing the slow oxidation or chemical\ndeterioration during storage, and improving the aging characteristics or the mois-\nture resistance. Bonding agents are additives to enhance adhesion between the\nsolid ingredients (AP or Al) and the binder. Stabilizers are intended to minimize\nthe slow chemical or physical reactions that can occur in propellants. Catalysts\nare sometimes added to the crosslinker or curing agent to slow down the curing\nrate. Lubricants aid the extrusion process. Desensitizing agents help to make a\npropellant more resistant to inadvertent energy stimulus. These are usually added\nin very small quantities.\n\nParticle-Size Parameters\n\nThe size, shape, and size distribution of the solid particles of AP, Al, or HMX\nin the propellant can have a major influence on the composite propellant charac-\nteristics. The particles are spherical in shape because this allows easier mixing\n",
    "538": "13.4. PROPELLANT INGREDIENTS 521\nand a higher percentage of solids in the propellant than shapes of sharp-edged\nnatural crystals. Normally, the ground AP oxidizer crystals are graded according\nto particle size ranges as follows:\n\nCoarse 400 to 600 um (1 um = 10~\u00b0 m)\nMedium 50 to 200 um\n\nFine 5 to 15 um\n\nUltrafine submicrometer to 5 um\n\nCoarse and medium-grade AP crystals are handled as class 1.3 materials,\nwhereas the fine and ultrafine grades are considered as class 1.1 high explosives\nand are usually manufactured on-site from the medium or coarse grades. (See\nSection 13.3 for a definition of these explosive hazard classifications.) Most\npropellants use a blend of oxidizer particle sizes, if only to maximize the weight\nof oxidizer per unit volume of propellant, with the small particles filling part of\nthe voids between the larger particles.\n\nFigure 13-8 shows the influence of varying the ratio of coarse to fine oxidizer\nparticle sizes on propellant burning rate and also the influence of a burning rate\nadditive. Figure 13\u20149 shows that the influence of particle size of the aluminum\nfuel on propellant burning rate is much less pronounced than that of oxidizer par-\nticle size. Figure 13-8 also shows the effect of particle size. Particle size range\nand particle shape of both the oxidizer [usually ammonium perchlorate (AP)]\nand solid fuel (usually aluminum) have a significant effect on the solid packing\nfraction and the rheological properties (associated with the flowing or pouring\nof viscous liquids) of uncured composite propellant. By definition, the packing\nfraction is the volume fraction of all solids when packed to minimum volume (a\ntheoretical condition). High packing fraction makes mixing, casting, and handling\nduring propellant fabrication more difficult. Figure 13-10 shows the distribution\nof AP particle size using a blend of sizes; the shape of this curve can be altered\ndrastically by controlling the size ranges and ratios. Also, the size range and shape\nof the solid particles affect the solids loading ratio, which is the mass ratio of\nsolid to total ingredients in the uncured propellants. Computer-optimized meth-\nods exist for adjusting particle-size distributions for improvement of the solids\nloading. The solids loading can be as high as 90% in some composite propel-\nlants. High solids loading, desired for high performance, introduces complexity\nand higher costs into the processing of propellant. Trade-off among ballistic (per-\nformance) requirements, processibility, mechanical strength, rejection rates, and\nfacility costs is a continuing problem with many high-specific-impulse composite\npropellants. References 13-2 and 13-14 report on the influence of particle size\non motor performance.\n\nA monomodal propellant has one size of solid oxidizer particles, a bimodal\nhas two sizes (say, 20 and 200 Um), and a trimodal propellant has three sizes,\nbecause this allows a larger mass of solids to be placed into the propellant.\nProblem 1 has a sketch that explains how the voids between the large particles\nare filled with smaller particles.\n",

Typical applications of gas generators were\nlisted in Table 12-1. A large variety of propellants have been used to create hot\ngas for gas generators, but only a few will be mentioned.\n\nStabilized AN-based propellants have been used for many years with various\ningredients or binders.

This is used on the MX missile launcher tube\ngas generator (Ref. 13-15). Another formulation uses HMX or RDX with an\nexcess of polyether- or polyester-type polyurethane.\n\nFor the inflation of automobile collision safety bags the exhaust gas must be\nnontoxic, smoke free, have a low temperature (will not burn people), be quickly\ninitiated, and be reliably available. One solution is to use alkali azides (e.g.,\nNaN3 or KN3) with an oxide and an oxidizer. The resulting nitrates or oxides are\nsolid materials that are removed by filtering and the gas is clean and is largely\nmoderately hot nitrogen. In one model, air can be aspirated into the air bag by\nthe hot, high-pressure gas (see Ref. 13-16). One particular composition uses 65\nto 75% NaN3, 10 to 28% Fe203, 5 to 16% NaNO; as an oxidizer, a burn rate\nmodifier, and a small amount of SiO2 for moisture absorption. The resultant solid\nnitride slag is caught in a filter.\n\nThe ideal power P delivered by a gas generator can be expressed as (see\nChapters 3 and 5)\n\nP = ti(Iy \u2014 hy) = [HTYRK/(k \u2014 DI = (p2/py Pr\") (3-1)\nwhere m is the mass flow rate, h, and hy the enthalpies per unit mass, respec-\ntively, at the gas generator chamber and exhaust pressure conditions, 7, is the\nflame temperature in the gas generator chamber, R the gas constant, p/p; is the\nreciprocal of the pressure ratio through which these gases are expanded, and k\n",

There is no or very little particulate matter in the exhaust\ngas. These minimum-smoke propellants are not a special class with a peculiar\nformulation but a variety of one of the classes mentioned previously. Propellants\ncontaining Al, Zr, Fe2O3 (burn rate modifier), or other metallic species will form\nvisible clouds of small solid metal or metal oxide particles in the exhaust.\n\nFor certain military applications a smokeless propellant is needed and the\nreasons are stated in Chapter 20 (Exhaust Plumes). It is very difficult to make\na propellant which has a truly smokeless exhaust gas. We therefore distinguish\nbetween low-smoke also called minimum-smoke (almost smokeless), and reduced-\nsmoke propellants, which have a faintly visible plume. A visible smoke trail\ncomes from solid particles in the plume, such as aluminum oxide. With enough of\n",
    "542": "13.5. OTHER PROPELLANT CATEGORIES 525\nthese particles, the exhaust plume will scatter or absorb light and become visible\nas primary smoke. The particles can act as focal points for moisture condensa-\ntion, which can occur in saturated air or under high-humidity, low-temperature\nconditions. Also, vaporized plume molecules, such as water or hydrochloric acid,\ncan condense in cold air and form droplets and thus a cloud trail. These processes\ncreate a vapor trail or secondary smoke.\n\nSeveral types of DB propellant, DB modified with HMX, nitramine (HMX\nor RDX) based composites, AN composites, or combinations of these, give very\nfew or no solid particles in their exhaust gas. They do not contain aluminum or\nAP, generally have lower specific impulse than comparable propellants with AP,\nand have very little primary smoke, but can have secondary smoke in unfavorable\nweather. Several of these propellants have been used in tactical missiles.\n\nReduced-smoke propellants are usually composite propellants with low con-\ncentrations of aluminum (1 to 6%); they have a low percentage of aluminum\noxide in the exhaust plume, are faintly visible as primary smoke, but can precip-\nitate heavy secondary smoke in unfavorable weather. Their performance is much\nbetter than that of minimum-smoke propellants, as seen in Fig. 13-1.\n\nIgniter Propellants\n\nThe process of propellant ignition is discussed in Section 14.2, and several types\nof igniter hardware are discussed in Section 15.3. Propellants for igniters, a spe-\ncialized field of propellant technology, is described here briefly. The requirements\nfor an igniter propellant will include the following:\n\nFast high heat release and high gas evolution per unit igniter propellant mass\nto allow rapid filling of grain cavity with hot gas and partial pressurization\nof the chamber.\n\nStable initiation and operation over a wide range of pressures (subatmospheric\nto chamber pressure) and smooth burning at low pressure with no ignition\noverpressure surge.\n\nRapid initiation of igniter propellant burning and low ignition delays.\n\nLow sensitivity of burn rate to ambient temperature changes and low burning\nrate pressure exponent.\n\nOperation over the required ambient temperature range.\n\nSafe and easy to manufacture, safe to ship and handle.\n\nGood aging characteristics and long life.\n\nMinimal moisture absorption or degradation with time.\n\nLow cost of ingredients and fabrication.\n\nSome igniters not only generate hot combustion gas, but also hot solid particles\nor hot liquid droplets, which radiate heat and impinge on the propellant surface,\nembed themselves into this surface, and assist in achieving propellant burning\non the exposed grain surface.\n",
    "543": "526 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\nThere have been a large variety of different igniter propellants and their devel-\nopment has been largely empirical.

In some cases rocket propellants that are used in\nthe main grain are also used for the igniter grain; sometimes they are slightly\nmodified. They are used in the form of a small rocket motor within a large motor\nthat is to be ignited. A common igniter formulation uses 20 to 35% boron and 65\nto 80% potassium nitrate with | to 5% binder. Binders typically include epoxy\nresins, graphite, nitrocellulose, vegetable oil, polyisobutylene, and other binders\nlisted in Table 13-7.

Their\nmaterials do not contain any oxidizing ingredients; they will ablate, cook, char,\nvaporize, or distintegrate in the presence of hot gases. Many will burn if the hot\ncombustion gas contains even a small amount of oxidizing species, but they will\nnot usually burn by themselves. The liner, internal insulator, or inhibitor must\nbe chemically compatible with the propellant and each other to avoid migration\n(described below) or changes in material composition; they must have good\nadhesive strength, so that they stay bonded to the propellant, or to each other.\nThe temperature at which they suffer damage or experience a large surface\nregression should be high. They should all have a low density, thus reducing\ninert mass. Typical materials are neoprene (specific gravity 1.23), butyl rubber\n(0.93), a synthetic rubber called ethylenepropylene diene or EPDM (0.86), or the\nbinder used in the propellant, such as polybutadiene (0.9 to 1.0); these values\nare low compared with a propellant specific gravity of 1.6 to 1.8. For low-smoke\npropellant these three rubber-like materials should give off some gas, but few, if\nany, solid particles (see Ref. 13-19).\n\nIn addition to the desired characteristics listed in the previous paragraph, the\nliner should be a soft stretchable rubber-type thin material (typically 0.02 to 0.04\nin. thick with 200 to 450% elongation) to allow relative movement along the bond\nline between the grain and the case. This differential expansion occurs because\nthe thermal coefficient of expansion of the grain is typically an order of magnitude\nhigher than that of the case. A liner will also seal fiber-wound cases (particularly\nthin cases), which are often porous, so that high-pressure hot gas cannot escape.\nA typical liner for a tactical guided missile has been made from polypropy-\nlene glycol (about 57%), a titanium oxide filler (about 20%), a di-isocyanate\ncrosslinker (about 20%), and minor ingredients such as an antioxidant. The motor\n",

Ethylenepropylene\ndiene monomer (EPDM) is linked into ethylenepropylene diene terpolymer to\nform a synthetic rubber which is often used as polymer for liners; it adheres and\nelongates nicely.\n\nIn some motors today the internal insulator not only provides for the thermal\nprotection of the case from the hot combustion gases, but also often serves\nthe function of the Jiner for good bonding between propellant and insulator or\ninsulator and case. Most motors still have a separate liner and an insulating layer.\nInternal thermal insulation should fulfill these additional requirements:\n\n1. It must be erosion resistant, particularly in the insulation of the motor\naft end or blast tube. This is achieved in part by using tough elastomeric\nmaterials, such as neoprene or butyl rubber, that are chemically resistant\nto the hot gas and the impact of particulates. This surface integrity is also\nachieved by forming a porous black carbon layer on its heated surface\ncalled a porous char layer, which remains after some of the interstitial\nmaterials have been decomposed and vaporized.\n\n2. It must provide good thermal resistance and low thermal conductivity to\nlimit heat transfer to the case and thus keep the case below its maximum\nallowable temperature, which is usually between 160 and 350\u00b0C for the\nplastic in composite material cases and about 550 and 950\u00b0C for most\nsteel cases. This is accomplished by filling the insulator with silicon oxide,\ngraphite, Kevlar, or ceramic particles. Asbestos is an excellent filler material\nbut is no longer used because of its health hazard.\n\n3. It should allow a large-deformation or strain to accommodate grain deflec-\ntions upon pressurization or temperature cycling, and transfer loads between\nthe grain and the case.\n\n4. The surface regression should be minimal so as to retain much of its original\ngeometric surface contour and allow a thin insulator.\n\nA simple relationship for the thickness d at any location in the motor depends\non the exposure time f,, the erosion rate r, (obtained from erosion tests at the\nlikely gas velocity and temperature), and the safety factor f which can range\nfrom 1.2 to 2.0:\n\nd =teref (13-2)\nSome designers use the rule that the insulation depth is twice the charred depth.\n\nThe thickness of the insulation is not usually uniform; it can vary by a factor\nof up to 20. It is thicker at locations such as the dome where it is exposed\nfor longer intervals and at higher scrubbing velocities than the insulator layers\nprotected by bonded propellant. Before making a material selection, it is necessary\nto evaluate the flow field and the thermal environment (combustion temperature,\n",
    "545": "528 SOLID PROPELLANTS\n\ngas composition, pressure, exposure duration, internal ballistics) in order to carry\nout a thermal analysis (erosion prediction and estimated thickness of insulator).\nAn analysis of loads and the deflections under loads at different locations of the\nmotor are needed to estimate shear and compression stresses. If it involves high\nstresses or a relief flap, a structural analysis is also needed. Various computer\nprograms, such as the one mentioned in Refs. 13-20 and 13-21, are used for\nthese analyses.\n\nAn inhibitor is usually made of the same kinds of materials as internal insu-\nlators. They are applied (bonded, molded, glued, or sprayed) to grain surfaces\nthat should not burn. In a segmented motor, for example (see Fig. 15-2), where\nburning is allowed only on the internal port area, the faces of the cylindrical\ngrain sections are inhibited.\n\nMigration is the transfer of mobile (liquid) chemical species from the solid\npropellant to the liner, insulator, or inhibitor, or vice versa. Liquid plasticizers\nsuch as NG or DEGN or unreacted monomers or liquid catalysts are known\nto migrate. This migratory transfer occurs very slowly; it can cause dramatic\nchanges in physical properties (e.g., the propellant next to the liner becomes brittle\nor weak), and there are several instances where nitroglycerine migrated into an\ninsulator and made it flammable. Migration can be prevented or inhibited by using\n(1) propellants without plasticizers, (2) insulators or binders with plasticizers\nidentical to those used in propellants, (3) a thin layer of an impervious material\nor a migration barrier (such as PU or a thin metal film), and (4) an insulator\nmaterial that will not allow migration (e.g., PU) (see Ref. 13-22).\n\nThe graphite\u2014epoxy motors used to boost the Delta launch vehicle use a\nthree-layer Jiner: EPDM (ethylenepropylene diene terpolymer) as a thin primer\nto enhance bond strength, a polyurethane barrier to prevent migration of the\nplasticizer into the EPDM liner, and a plasticized HTPB-rich liner to prevent\nburning next to the case\u2014bond interface. The composite AP\u2014AI propellant also\nuses the same HTPB binder.\n\nLiners, insulators, or inhibitors can be applied to the grain in several ways: by\npainting, coating, dipping, spraying, or by gluing a sheet or strip to the case or\nthe grain. Often an automated, robotic machine is used to achieve uniform thick-\nness and high quality. Reference 13\u201421 describes the manufacture of particular\ninsulators.\n\nAn external insulation is often applied to the outside of the motor case, par-\nticularly in tactical missiles or high-acceleration launch boosters. This insulation\nreduces the heat flow from the boundary layer outside the vehicle surface (which\nis aerodynamically heated) to the case and then to the propellant. It thus pre-\nvents fiber-reinforced plastic cases from becoming weak or the propellant from\nbecoming soft or, in extreme situations, from being ignited. This insulator must\nwithstand the oxidation caused by heated air, have good adhesion, have structural\nintegrity to loads imposed by the flight or launch, and must have a reasonable cure\ntemperature. Materials ordinarily used as internal insulators are unsatisfactory,\nbecause they burn in the atmosphere and generate heat. The best is a non-\npyrolyzing, low-thermal-conductivity refractory material (Ref. 13-23) such as\n",
    "546": "13.7. PROPELLANT PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURE 529\nhigh-temperature paint. The internal and external insulation also helps to reduce\nthe grain temperature fluctuations and thus thermal stresses imposed by ther-\nmal cycling, such as day\u2014night variations or high- and low-altitude temperature\nvariations for airborne missiles.\n\n13.7. PROPELLANT PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURE\n\nThe manufacture of solid propellant involves complex physical and chemical pro-\ncesses. In the past, propellant has been produced by several different processes,\nincluding the compaction or pressing of powder charges, extrusion of propel-\nlant through dies under pressure using heavy presses, and mixing with a solvent\nwhich is later evaporated. Even for the same type of propellant (e.g., double-base,\ncomposite, or composite double-base) the fabrication processes are usually not\nidentical for different manufacturers, motor types, sizes, or propellant formula-\ntion, and no single simple generalized process flowsheet or fabrication technique\nis prevalent. Most of the rocket motors in production today use composite-type\npropellants and therefore some emphasis on this process is given here.\n\nFigure 13-11 shows a representative flowsheet for the manufacture of a com-\nplete solid rocket motor with a composite propellant made by batch processes.\nProcesses marked with an asterisk are potentially hazardous, are usually operated\nor controlled remotely, and are usually performed in buildings designed to with-\nstand potential fires or explosions. The mixing and casting processes are the most\ncomplex and are more critical than other processes in determining the quality,\nperformance, burn rate, and physical properties of the resulting propellant.\n\nThe rheological properties of the uncured propellant, meaning its flow proper-\nties in terms of shear rate, stress, and time, are all-important to the processibility\nof the propellant, and these properties usually change substantially throughout the\nlength of the processing line. Batch-type processing of propellant, including the\ncasting (pouring) of propellant into motors that serve as their own molds, is the\nmost common method. For very large motors several days are needed for casting\nperhaps 40 batches into a single case, forming a single grain. Vacuum is almost\nalways imposed on the propellant during the mixing and casting operations to\nremove air and other dispersed gases and to avoid air bubbles in the grain. Vis-\ncosity measurements of the mixed propellant (10,000 to 20,000 poise) are made\nfor quality control. Vacuum, temperature, vibration, energy input of the mixer,\nand time are some of the factors affecting the viscosity of the uncured propellant.\nTime is important in terms of pot life, that period of time the uncured propellant\nremains reasonably fluid after mixing before it cures and hardens. Short pot life\n(a few hours) requires fast operations in emptying mixers, measuring for qual-\nity control, transporting, and casting into motors. Some binder systems, such as\nthose using PVC, give a very long pot life and avoid the urgency or haste in the\nprocessing line. References 13-3, 13-10, and 13-24 give details on propellant\nprocessing techniques and equipment.\n\nDouble-base propellants and modified double-base propellants are manufac-\ntured by a different set of processes. The key is the diffusion of the liquid\n",

In general, voids and other flaws\ndegrade the ballistic and mechanical properties of the propellant grain. Finely\ndispersed gas in a propellant grain may result in an abnormally high burning\nrate, one so high as to cause catastrophic motor failure.\n\nThe finished grain (or motor) is usually inspected for defects (cracks, voids,\nand debonds) using X-ray, ultrasonic, heat conductivity, or other nondestructive\ninspection techniques. Samples of propellant are taken from each batch, tested\nfor rheological properties, and cast into physical property specimens and/or small\nmotors which are cured and subsequently tested. A determination of the sensitiv-\nity of motor performance, including possible failure, to propellant voids and other\nflaws often requires the test firing of motors with known defects. Data from the\ntests are important in establishing inspection criteria for accepting and rejecting\nproduction motors.\n\nSpecial process equipment is needed in the manufacture of propellant. For\ncomposite propellants this includes mechanical mixers (usually with two or three\nblades rotating on vertical shafts agitating propellant ingredients in a mixer\nbowl under vacuum), casting equipment, curing ovens, or machines for auto-\nmatically applying the liner or insulation to the case. Double-base processing\nrequires equipment for mechanically working the propellant (rollers, presses) or\nspecial tooling for allowing a slurry cast process. Computer-aided filament wind-\ning machines are used for laying the fibers of fiber-reinforced plastic cases and\nnozzles.\n\nPROBLEMS\n\n1. Ideally the solid oxidizer particles in a propellant can be considered spheres of uniform\nsize. Three sizes of particles are available: coarse at 500 um, medium at 50 tm, and\nfine at 5 um, all at a specific gravity of 1.95, and a viscoelastic fuel binder at a specific\ngravity of 1.01. Assume that these materials can be mixed and vibrated so that the\nsolid particles will touch each other, there are no voids in the binder, and the particles\noccupy a minimum of space similar to the sketch of the cross section shown here.\n\nIt is desired to put 94 wt % of oxidizer into the propellant mix, for this will give\n\nmaximum performance. (a) Determine the maximum weight percentage of oxidizer if\n\nonly coarse crystals are used or if only medium-sized crystals are used. (b) Determine\nthe maximum weight of oxidizer if both coarse and fine crystals are used, with the fine\ncrystals filling the voids between the coarse particles. What is the optimum relative\nproportion of coarse and fine particles to give a maximum of oxidizer? (c) Same as part\n\n(b), but use coarse and medium crystals only. Is this better and, if so, why?

It is also known\nthat bad propellant would be produced if there are leaks that destroy the vacuum, if\nthe bowl, mixing blades, feed chutes, and so on, are not clean but contain deposits of\nold propellant on their walls, if they are not mixed at 80\u00b0C, or if the viscosity of the\nmix becomes excessive.

    "554": "CHAPTER 14\nSS\nSOLID PROPELLANT COMBUSTION\nAND ITS STABILITY\n\nIn this the third of four chapters on solid propellant motors, we discuss the\ncombustion of solid propellants, the physical and chemical processes of burning,\nthe ignition or startup process, the extinction of burning, and combustion\ninstability.\n\nThe combustion process in rocket propulsion systems is very efficient, when\ncompared to other power plants, because the combustion temperatures are rela-\ntively very high; this accelerates the rate of chemical reaction, helping to achieve\nnearly complete combustion. As was mentioned in Chapter 2, the energy released\nin the combustion is between 95 and 99.5% of the possible maximum. This is\ndifficult to improve. The rocket motor designers have been concerned not so\nmuch with the burning process as with controlling the combustion (start, stop,\nheat effects) and with preventing the occurrence of combustion instability.\n14.1. PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES\nCombustion in a solid propellant motor involves exceedingly complex reactions\ntaking place in the solid, liquid, and gas phases of a heterogeneous mixture. Not\nonly are the physical and chemical processes occurring during solid propellant\ncombustion not fully understood, but analytical combustion models remain\noversimplified and unreliable. Experimental observations of burning propellants\nshow complicated three-dimensional microstructures, a three-dimensional flame\nstructure, intermediate products in the liquid and gaseous phase, spatially and\ntemporally variant processes, aluminum agglomeration, nonlinear response\nbehavior, formation of carbon particles, and other complexities yet to be\nadequately reflected in mathematical models.\n\n537\n",
    "555": "538 SOLID PROPELLANT COMBUSTION AND ITS STABILITY\n\nSome insight into this combustion process can be gained by understanding the\nbehavior of the major ingredients, such a ammonium perchlorate, which is fairly\nwell explored. This oxidizer is capable of self-deflagration with a low-pressure\ncombustion limit at approximately 2 MPa and at least four distinct \u201cfroth\u201d zones\nof combustion between 2 and 70 MPa, the existence of a liquid froth on the\nsurface of the crystal during deflagration between 2 and 6 MPa, and a change in\nthe energy transfer mechanism (particularly at about 14 MPa). Its influence on\ncombustion is critically dependent on oxidizer purity. The surface regression rate\nranges from 3 mm/sec at 299 K and 2 MPa to 10 mm/sec at 423 K and 1.4 MPa.\n\nThe various polymeric binders used in composite propellants are less well\ncharacterized, and their combustion properties vary, depending on the binder\ntype, heating rate, and combustion chamber pressure.\n\nThe addition of powdered aluminum (2 to 40 Um) is known to favorably\ninfluence specific impulse and combustion stability. Photographs of the burning\naluminum particles show that the particles usually collect into relatively large\naccumulates (100 or more particles) during the combustion process. The com-\nbustion behavior of this ingredient depends on many variables, including particle\nsize and shape, surface oxides, the binder, and the combustion wave environment.\nReference 14\u20141 describes solid propellant combustion.\n\nVisual observations and measurements of flames in simple experiments, such\nas strand burner tests, give an insight into the combustion process. For double-\nbase propellants the combustion flame structure appears to be homogeneous and\none-dimensional along the burning direction, as shown in Fig. 14\u20141. When heat\nfrom the combustion melts, decomposes, and vaporizes the solid propellant at\nthe burning surface, the resulting gases seem to be already premixed. One can\nsee a brilliantly radiating bright flame zone where most of the chemical reaction\nis believed to occur and a dark zone between the bright flame and the burning\nsurface. The brightly radiating hot reaction zone appears to be detached from the\ncombustion surface. The combustion that occurs inside the dark zone does not\nemit strongly in the visible spectrum but does emit in the infrared spectral region.\nThe dark zone thickness decreases with increasing chamber pressure, and higher\nheat transfer to the burning surface causes the burning rate to increase. Experi-\nments on strand burners in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, reported in Chapter 1\nof Ref. 14-1, show this dramatically: for pressures of 10, 20, and 30 atm the\ndark zone thickness is 12, 3.3, and 1.4 mm, respectively, and the corresponding\nburning rates are 2.2, 3.1, and 4.0 mm/sec. The overall length of the visible flame\nbecomes shorter as the chamber pressure increases and the heat release per unit\nvolume near the surface also increases. In the bright, thin fizz zone or combus-\ntion zone directly over the burning surface of a DB propellant, some burning and\nheat release occurs. Beneath is a zone of liquefied bubbling propellant which is\nthought to be very thin (less than | fm) and which has been called the foam or\ndegradation zone. Here the temperature becomes high enough for the propellant\nmolecules to vaporize and break up or degrade into smaller molecules, such as\nNOp, aldehydes, or NO, which leave the foaming surface.

See Chapters 2, 3,\nand 4 by Kishore and Gayathri, Boggs, and Fifer, respectively, in Ref. 14-1, and\nRefs. 14-2 to 14-8.\n\nThe burning rate of all propellants is influenced by pressure (see Section 12.1\nand Eq. 12-5), the initial ambient solid propellant temperature, the burn rate\ncatalyst, the aluminum particle sizes and their size distribution, and to a lesser\nextent by other ingredients and manufacturing process variables. Erosive burning\nwas discussed in Chapter 12. Analysis of combustion is treated later in this\nchapter.\n\n14.2. IGNITION PROCESS\n\nThis section is concerned with the mechanism or the process for initiating\nthe combustion of a solid propellant grain. Specific propellants that have\nbeen successfully used for igniters have been mentioned in Section 13.5. The\nhardware, types, design, and integration of igniters into the motor are described\nin Section 15.4. Chapters 2, 5, and 6 of Ref. 14\u20141 review the state of the art\nof ignition, data from experiments, and analytical models.\n\nSolid propellant ignition consists of a series of complex rapid events, which\nstart on receipt of a signal (usually electric) and include heat generation, transfer\nof the heat from the igniter to the motor grain surface, spreading the flame over\nthe entire burning surface area, filling the chamber free volume (cavity) with gas,\nand elevating the chamber pressure without serious abnormalities such as over-\npressures, combustion oscillations, damaging shock waves, hangfires (delayed\nignition), extinguishment, and chuffing. The igniter in a solid rocket motor gen-\nerates the heat and gas required for motor ignition.\n\nMotor ignition must usually be complete in a fraction of a second for all but\nthe very large motors (see Ref. 14\u20149). The motor pressure rises to an equilibrium\nstate in a very short time, as shown in Fig. 14\u20143. Conventionally, the ignition\nprocess is divided into three phases for analytical purposes:\n\nPhase I, Ignition time lag: the period from the moment the igniter receives a\n\nsignal until the first surface grain burns.\n\nPhase II, Flame-spreading interval: the time from first ignition of the grain\n\nsurface until the complete grain burning area has been ignited.\n\nPhase III, Chamber-filling interval: the time for completing the chamber-filling\n\nprocess and for reaching equilibrium chamber pressure and flow.\n\nThe ignition will be successful once enough grain surface is ignited and burn-\ning, so that the motor will continue to raise its own pressure to the operating\nchamber pressure. The critical process seems to be a gas-phase reaction above\nthe burning surface, when propellant vapors or decomposition products interact\nwith each other and with the igniter gas products.

An electric signal\nis received a few milliseconds before time zero.\nenough, some grain surfaces may burn for a short time, but the flame will be\nextinguished.\n\nSatisfactory attainment of equilibrium chamber pressure with full gas flow is\ndependent on (1) characteristics of the igniter and the gas temperature, composi-\ntion and flow issuing from the igniter, (2) motor propellant composition and grain\nsurface ignitability, (3) heat transfer characteristics by radiation and convection\nbetween the igniter gas and grain surface, (4) grain flame spreading rate, and\n(5) the dynamics of filling the motor free volume with hot gas (see Ref. 14-10).\nThe quantity and type of caloric energy needed to ignite a particular motor grain\nin the prevailing environment has a direct bearing on most of the igniters\u2019 design\nparameters\u2014 particularly those affecting the required heat output. The ignitability\nof a propellant at a given pressure and temperature is normally shown as a plot\nof ignition time versus heat flux received by the propellant surface, as shown in\nFig. 14\u20144; these data are obtained from laboratory tests. Ignitability of a propel-\nlant is affected by many factors, including (1) the propellant formulation, (2) the\ninitial temperature of the propellant grain surface, (3) the surrounding pressure,\n(4) the mode of heat transfer, (5) grain surface roughness, (6) age of the pro-\npellant, (7) the composition and hot solid particle content of the igniter gases,\n(8) the igniter propellant and its initial temperature, (9) the velocity of the hot\nigniter gases relative to the grain surface, and (10) the cavity volume and config-\nuration. Figure 14\u20144 and data in Chapter 15 show that the ignition time becomes\nshorter with increases in both heat flux and chamber pressure. If a short ignition\ndelay is required, then a more powerful igniter will be needed. The radiation\neffects can be significant in the ignition transient as described in Ref. 14-11. In\nSection 15.3 we describe an analysis and design for igniters.\n",

Very rapid depressurization, usually by a sudden, large increase of the\nnozzle throat area or by fast opening of additional gas escape areas or\nports. The most common technique neutralizes the thrust or reverses the\nnet thrust direction by suddenly opening exhaust ports in the forward\nend of the motor case. Such a thrust reversal using ports located on the\nforward bulkhead of the case is achieved in the upper stages of Minuteman\nand Poseidon missiles. This is done by highly predictable and reproducible\nexplosive devices which suddenly open additional gas escape areas (thus\ncausing pressure reduction) and neutralize the thrust by exhausting gases\nin a direction opposite to that of the motor nozzle. To balance side\nforces, the thrust termination blow-out devices and their ducts are always\ndesigned in symmetrically opposed sets (two or more). In Fig. 1-5 there\nare four symmetrically placed openings that are blown into the forward\ndome of the case by circular explosive cords. Two of the sheathed circular\ncord assemblies are sketched on the outside of the forward dome wall.\nThe ducts that lead the hot gas from these openings to the outside of the\nvehicle are not shown in this figure. The forward flow of gas occurs only\nfor a very brief period of time, during which the thrust is actually reversed.\nThe rapid depressurization causes a sudden stopping of the combustion\nat the propellant burning surface. With proper design the explosive\ncords do not cause a detonation or explosion of the remaining unburned\npropellant.\n\n2. During some motor development projects it can be helpful to see a par-\ntially consumed grain. The motor operation is stopped when the flames are\nquenched by an inhibiting liquid such as water. Reference 14-12 shows\nthat adding a detergent to the water allows better contact with the burning\nsurface and reduces the amount of water needed for quenching.\n\n3. Lowering the combustion pressure below the pressure deflagration limit.\nCompared to item 1, this depressurization occurs quite slowly. Many solid\npropellants have a low-pressure combustion limit of 0.05 to 0.15 MPa.\nThis means that some propellants will not extinguish when vented during\na static sea-level test at | atm (0.1 MPa) but will stop burning if vented at\nhigh altitude.\n\nA sudden depressurization is effective because the primary combustion zone at\nthe propellant surface has a time lag compared to the gaseous combustion zone\nwhich, at the lower pressure, quickly adjusts to a lower reaction rate and moves\nfarther away from the burning surface. The gases created by the vaporization\nand pyrolysis of the hot solid propellant cannot all be consumed in a gas\nreaction close to the surface, and some will not burn completely. As a result,\nthe heat transfer to the propellant surface will be quickly reduced by several\norders of magnitude, and the reaction at the propellant surface will diminish and\n",

Experimental results (Chapter 12 of Ref. 14-1) show that a higher initial\ncombustion pressure requires a faster depressurization rate (dp/dt) to achieve\nextinction.\n\n14.4. COMBUSTION INSTABILITY\n\nThere are two types of combustion instability: a set of acoustic resonances or\npressure oscillations, which can occur with any rocket motor, and vortex shedding\nphenomena, which occur only with relatively large segmented grains or in grains\nwith circular slots.\n\nAcoustic Instabilities\n\nWhen a solid propellant rocket motor experiences unstable combustion, the pres-\nsure in the interior gaseous cavities (made up by the volume of the port or\nperforations, fins, slots, conical or radial groves) oscillates by at least 5% and\noften by more than 30% of the chamber pressure. When instability occurs, the\nheat transfer to the burning surfaces, the nozzle, and the insulated case walls is\ngreatly increased; the burning rate, chamber pressure, and thrust usually increase;\nbut the burning duration is thereby decreased. The change in the thrust\u2014time pro-\nfile causes significant changes in the flight path, and at times this can lead to\nfailure of the mission. If prolonged and if the vibration energy level is high, the\ninstability can cause damage to the hardware, such as overheating the case and\ncausing a nozzle or case failure. Instability is a condition that should be avoided\nand must be carefully investigated and remedied if it occurs during a motor\ndevelopment program. Final designs of motors must be free of such instability.\n\nThere are fundamental differences with liquid propellant combustion behavior.\nIn liquid propellants there is a fixed chamber geometry with a rigid wall;\nliquids in feed systems and in injectors that are not part of the oscillating gas in\nthe combustion chamber, can interact strongly with the pressure fluctuations.\nIn solid propellant motors the geometry of the oscillating cavity increases in\nsize as burning proceeds and there are stronger damping factors, such as solid\nparticles and energy-absorbing viscoelastic materials. In general, combustion\ninstability problems do not occur frequently or in every motor development,\nand, when they do occur, it is rarely the cause for a drastic sudden motor failure\nor disintegration. Nevertheless, drastic failures have occurred.\n\nUndesirable oscillations in the combustion cavity propellant rocket motors is a\ncontinuing problem in the design, development, production, and even long-term\n(10 yr) retention of solid rocket missiles. While acoustically \u201csofter\u201d than a liquid\nrocket combustion chamber, the combustion cavity of a solid propellant rocket\nis still a low-loss acoustical cavity containing a very large acoustical energy\nsource, the combustion process itself. A small fraction of the energy released by\ncombustion is more than sufficient to drive pressure vibrations to an unaccep-\ntable level.\n",

The dashed lines\nshow the upper and lower boundaries of the high-frequency pressure oscillations, and\nthe dot-dash curve is the behavior without instability after a slight change in propellant\nformulation. The vibration period shows a rise in the mean pressure. With vibration, the\neffective burning time is reduced and the average thrust is higher. The total impulse is\nessentially unchanged.\n\nCombustion instability can occur spontaneously, often at some particular time\nduring the motor burn period, and the phenomenon is usually repeatable in iden-\ntical motors. Both longitudinal and transverse waves (radial and tangential) can\noccur. Figure 14\u20145 shows a pressure\u2014time profile with typical instability. The\npressure oscillations increase in magnitude, and the thrust and burning rate also\nincrease. The frequency seems to be a function of the cavity geometry, propel-\nlant composition, pressure, and internal flame field. As the internal grain cavity\nis enlarged and local velocities change, the oscillation often abates and disap-\npears. The time and severity of the combustion vibration tend to change with the\nambient grain temperature prior to motor operation.\n\nFor a simple grain with a cylindrical port area, the resonant transverse mode\noscillations (tangential and radial) correspond roughly to those shown in Fig. 9-4\nfor liquid propellant thrust chambers. The longitudinal or axial modes, usually\nat a lower frequency, are an acoustic wave traveling parallel to the motor axis\nbetween the forward end of the perforation and the convergent nozzle section.\nHarmonic frequencies of these basic vibration modes can also be excited. The\ninternal cavities can become very complex and can include igniter cases, movable\nas well as submerged nozzles, fins, cones, slots, star-shaped perforations, or other\nshapes, as described in the section on grain geometry in Chapter 12; determination\nof the resonant frequencies of complex cavities is not always easy. Furthermore,\nthe geometry of the internal resonating cavity changes continually as the burning\n",

COMBUSTION INSTABILITY 547\npropellant surfaces recede; as the cavity volume becomes larger, the transverse\noscillation frequencies are reduced.\n\nAs the internal grain cavity grows, the resonant frequency changes and the\ninstability abates and then disappears. Figure 14\u20145 shows two instances where a\ncombustion instability was triggered and its amplitude increased for a brief period\nand then diminished, the frequency decreased (due to cavity volume increase) and\nthen the instability disappeared. Nevertheless, the resulting thrust\u2014time curve is\ndifferent and the flight path will be changed, often preventing the reaching of a\nmission target.\n\nThe bulk mode, also known as the Helmholtz mode, L* mode, or chuffing\nmode, is not a wave mode as described above. It occurs at relatively low fre-\nquencies (typically below 150 Hz and sometimes below 1 Hz), and the pressure\nis essentially uniform throughout the volume. The unsteady velocity is close to\nzero, but the pressure rises and falls. It is the gas motion (in and out of the\nnozzle) that corresponds to the classical Helmholtz resonator mode, similar to\nexciting a tone when blowing across the open mouth of a bottle (see Fig. 9-7). It\noccurs at low values of L* (see Eq. 8-9), sometimes during the ignition period,\nand disappears when the motor internal volume becomes larger or the chamber\npressure becomes higher. Chuffing is the periodic low-frequency discharge of\na bushy, unsteady flame of short duration (typically less than 1 sec) followed\nby periods of no visible flame, during which slow out-gassing and vaporization\nof the solid propellant accumulates hot gas in the chamber. The motor experi-\nences spurts of combustion and consequent pressure buildup followed by periods\nof nearly ambient pressure. This dormant period can extend for a fraction of a\nsecond to a few seconds (Ref. 14-13 and Chapter 13 by Price in Ref. 14-1).\n\nA useful method of visualizing unstable pressure waves is shown in Figs. 9-5\nand 14-6 and Ref. 14-14. It consists of a series of Fourier analyses of the mea-\nsured pressure vibration spectrum, each taken at a different time in the burning\nduration and displayed at successive vertical positions on a time scale, providing\na map of amplitude versus frequency versus burning time. This figure shows a\nlow-frequency axial mode and two tangential modes, whose frequency is reduced\nin time by the enlargement of the cavity; it also shows the timing of different\nvibrations, and their onset and demise.\n\nThe initiation or triggering of a particular vibration mode is still not well under-\nstood but has to do with energetic combustion at the propellant surface. A sudden\nchange in pressure is known to be a trigger, such as when a piece of broken-\noff insulation or unburned propellant flows through the nozzle and temporarily\nblocks all or a part of the nozzle area (causing a momentary pressure rise).\n\nThe shifting balance between amplifying and damping factors changes during\nthe burning operation and this causes the growth and also the abatement of\nspecific modes of vibration. The response of a solid propellant describes the\nchange in the gas mass production or energy release at the burning surface when\nit is stimulated by pressure perturbations. When a momentary high-pressure peak\noccurs on the surface, it increases the instantaneous heat transfer and thus the\nburning rate, causing the mass flow from that surface to also increase.

The particles accelerate and decelerate by being \u201cdragged\u201d\nalong by the motion of the gas, a viscous flow process that absorbs energy.\nThe attenuation for each particular vibration frequency is an optimum at\na particular size of particles; high damping for low-frequency oscillation\n(large motors) occurs with relatively large solid particles (8 to 20 um); for\nsmall motors or high-frequency waves the best damping occurs with small\nparticles (2 to 6 um). The attenuation drops off sharply if the particle size\ndistribution in the combustion gas is not concentrated near the optimum\nfor damping.\n\n3. Energy from longitudinal and mixed transverse/longitudinal waves is lost\nout through the exhaust nozzle. Energy from purely transverse waves does\nnot seem to be damped by this mechanism.\n\n4. Acoustic energy is absorbed by the viscoelastic solid propellant, insulator,\nand the motor case; its magnitude is difficult to estimate.\n\nThe propellant characteristics have a strong effect on the susceptibility to\ninstability. Changes in the binder, particle-size distribution, ratio of oxidizer to\nfuel, and burn-rate catalysts can all affect stability, often in ways that are not\npredictable. All solid propellants can experience instability. As a part of charac-\nterizing a new or modified propellant (e.g., determining its ballistic, mechanical,\naging, and performance characteristics), many companies now also evaluate it\nfor its stability behavior, as described below.\n\nAnalytical Models and Simulation of Combustion Stability\n\nMany investigations have been aimed at mathematical models that will simulate\nthe combustion behavior of solid propellants. This was reviewed by T\u2019ien in\nChapter 14 of Ref 14-1. Several aspects of combustion stability are treated in\nsome depth in Refs. 14\u201417 and 14-18.\n\nUsing computers it has been possible to successfully simulate the combus-\ntion for some limited cases, such as for validating or extrapolating experimental\nresults or making limited predictions of the stability of motor designs. This applies\nto well-characterized propellants, where empirical constants (such as propellant\nresponse or particle-size distribution) have been determined and where the range\nof operating parameters, internal geometries, or sizes has been narrow. It is\nunlikely that a reliable simple analysis will be found for predicting the occur-\nrence, severity, nature, and location of instability for a given propellant and\nmotor design. The physical and chemical phenomena are complex, multidimen-\nsional, unsteady, nonlinear, influenced by many variables, and difficult to emulate\nmathematically without a good number of simplifying assumptions.

Undertaking stability\ntests on large full-scale flight-hardware rocket motors is expensive, and therefore\nlower-cost methods, such as subscale motors, T-burners, and other test equipment,\nhave been used to assess motor stability.\n\nThe best known and most widely used method of gaining combustion stability-\nrelated data is the use of a T-burner, an indirect, limited method that does not\nuse a full-scale motor.

Venting can be through a sonic nozzle to the atmosphere\nor by a pipe connected to a surge tank which maintains a constant level of\npressure in the burner cavity. T-burner design and usage usually concentrate\non the portion of the frequency spectrum dealing with the transverse oscillations\nexpected in a full-scale motor. The desired acoustical frequency, to be imposed on\nthe propellant charge as it burns, determines the burner length (distance between\nclosed ends).\n\nThe nozzle location, midway between the ends of the T-burner, minimizes\nattentuation of fundamental longitudinal mode oscillations (in the propellant grain\ncavity). Theoretically, an acoustic pressure node exists at the center and antinodes\noccur at the ends of the cavity. Acoustic velocity nodes are out of phase with\npressure waves and occur at the ends of the burner. Propellant charges are often\nin the shape of disks or cups cemented to the end faces of the burner. The gas\nvelocity in the burner cavity is kept intentionally low (Mach 0.2 or less) compared\nwith the velocity in a full-scale motor. This practice minimizes the influence\nof velocity-coupled energy waves and allows the influence of pressure-coupled\nwaves to be more clearly recognized.\n\nUse of the T-burner for assessing the stability of a full-scale solid rocket\npresupposes valid theoretical models of the phenomena occurring in both the\nT-burner and the actual rocket motor; these theories are still not fully validated.\nIn addition to assessing solid rocket motor combustion stability, the T-burner also\nis used to evaluate new propellant formulations and the importance of seemingly\nsmall changes in ingredients, such as a change in aluminum powder particle size\nand oxidizer grind method.\n\nOnce an instability has been observed or predicted in a given motor, the\ndesigner has to fix the problem. There is no sure method for selecting the remedy,\nand none of the cures suggested below may work. The usual alternatives are:\n\n1. Changing the grain geometry to shift the frequencies away from the unde-\nsirable values. Sometimes, changing fin locations, port cross-section profile,\nor number of slots has been successful.\n\n2. Changing the propellant composition. Using aluminum as an additive has\nbeen most effective in curing transverse instabilities, provided that the\nparticle-size distribution of the aluminum oxide is favorable to optimum\ndamping at the distributed frequency. Changing size distribution and using\nother particulates (Zr, Al,O3, or carbon particles) has been effective in\nsome cases. Sometimes changes in the binder have worked.\n\n3. Adding a mechanical device for attenuating the unsteady gas motions\nor changing the natural frequency of cavities. Various inert resonance\nrods, baffles, or paddles have been added, mostly as a fix to an\nexisting motor with observed instability. They can change the resonance\nfrequencies of cavities, but introduce additional viscous surface losses,\nand cause extra inert mass and potential problems with heat transfer or\nerosion.\n",
    "569": "552 \u2014 SOLID PROPELLANT COMBUSTION AND ITS STABILITY\n\nCombustion instability has to be addressed during the design process, usually\nthrough a combination of some mathematical simulation, understanding similar\nproblems in other motors, studies of possible changes, and supporting experi-\nmental work (e.g., T-burners, measuring particle-size distribution). Most solid\npropellant rocket companies have in-house two- and three-dimensional computer\nprograms to calculate the likely acoustic modes (axial, tangential, radial, and\ncombinations of these) for a given grain/motor, the initial and intermediate cavity\ngeometries, and the combustion gas properties calculated from thermochemical\nanalysis. Data on combustion response (dynamic burn rate behavior) and damp-\ning can be obtained from T-burner tests. Data on particle sizes can be estimated\nfrom prior experience, observation through windows or plume measurements\n(Ref. 14-20). Estimates of nozzle losses, friction, or other damping need to be\nincluded. Depending on the balance between gain and damping, it may be possible\nto arrive at conclusions on the grain\u2019s propensity to instability for each specific\ninstability mode that is analyzed. If unfavorable, either the grain geometry or the\npropellant usually have to be modified. If favorable, full-scale motors have to\nbe built and tested to validate the predicted stable burning characteristics. There\nis always a trade-off between the amount of work spent on extensive analysis,\nsubscale experiments, and computer programs (which will not always guarantee\na stable motor) and taking a chance that a retrofit will be needed after full-scale\nmotors have been tested. If the instability is not discovered until after the motor\nis in production, it is usually more difficult, time consuming, and expensive to\nfix the problem.\nVortex-Shedding Instability\nThis instability is associated with burning on the inner surfaces of slots in\nthe grain. Large segmented rocket motors have slots between segments, and\nsome grain configurations have slots that intersect the centerline of the grain.\nFigure 14\u20148 shows that hot gases from the burning slot surfaces enter the main\nflow in the perforation or central cavity of the grain. The hot gas from the slot\nis turned into a direction toward the nozzle. The flow from the side stream\nrestricts the flow emanating from the upstream side of the perforation and, in\neffect, reduces the port area. This restriction causes the upstream port pressure\nto rise; sometimes there is a substantial pressure rise. The interaction of the\ntwo subsonic gas flows causes turbulence. Vortices form and are periodically\nshed or allowed to flow downstream, thereby causing an unstable flow pattern.\nThe vortex shedding patterns can interact with the acoustic instabilities. Refer-\nence 14\u201421 gives a description and Ref. 14\u201422 a method for analyzing these\nvortex-shedding phenomena. The remedy usually is to apply inhibitors to some\nburning surfaces or to change the grain geometry; for example, by increasing the\nwidth of the slot, the local velocities are reduced and the vortices become less\npronounced.\n",

Although the thrust vector\ncontrol mechanism is also a component of many rocket motors, it is described\nseparately in Chapter 18. The key to the success of many of these components is\nnew materials which have been developed in recent years. Motor case technology\nand pyrogen igniters are discussed.\n15.1. MOTOR CASE\nThe solid propellant motor case not only contains the propellant grain, but also\nserves as a highly loaded pressure vessel. Case design and fabrication technology\nhas progressed to where efficient and reliable motor cases can be produced con-\nsistently for any solid rocket application. Most problems arise when established\ntechnology is used improperly or from improper design analysis, understating the\nrequirements, or improper material and process control, including the omission\nof nondestructive tests at critical points in the fabrication process. Case design is\nusually governed by a combination of motor and vehicle requirements. Besides\nconstituting the structural body of the rocket motor with its nozzle, propellant\ngrain, and so on, the case frequently serves also as the primary structure of\nthe missile or launch vehicle. Thus the optimization of a case design frequently\nentails trade-offs between case design parameters and vehicle design parameters.\nOften, case design is influenced by assembly and fabrication requirements.\nTable 15-1 lists many of the types of loads and their sources; they must be\nconsidered at the beginning of a case design. Only some of them apply to any\n556\n",

In addition, the environmental conditions peculiar\nto a specific motor and its usage must be carefully considered. Typically, these\nconditions include the following: (1) temperature (internal heating, aerodynamic\nheating, ambient temperature cycling during storage, or thermal stresses and\nstrains); (2) corrosion (moisture/chemical, galvanic, stress corrosion, or hydrogen\nembrittlement); (3) space conditions: vacuum or radiation.\n\nThree classes of materials have been used: high-strength metals (such as steel,\naluminum, or titanium alloys), wound-filament reinforced plastics, and a com-\nbination of these in which a metal case has externally wound filaments for\nextra strength. Table 15-2 gives a comparison of several typical materials. For\nfilament-reinforced materials it gives the data not only for the composite material,\nbut also for several strong filaments and a typical binder. The strength-to-density\nratio is higher for composite materials, which means that they have less inert\nmass. Even though there are some important disadvantages, the filament-wound\ncases with a plastic binder are usually superior on a vehicle performance basis.\nMetal cases combined with an external filament-wound reinforcement and spiral-\nwound metal ribbons glued together with plastic have also been successful.\n\nThe shape of the case is usually determined from the grain configuration or\nfrom geometric vehicle constraints on length or diameter. The case configurations\nrange from long and thin cylinders (L/D of 10) to spherical or near-spherical\ngeometries (see Figs. 1-5, 12\u20141 to 12\u20144, and 12-17). The spherical shape gives\nthe lowest case mass per unit of enclosed volume. The case is often a key struc-\ntural element of the vehicle, and it sometimes has to provide for mounting of\nother components, such as fins, skirts, electric conduits, or thrust vector con-\ntrol actuators. The propellant mass fractions of the motor are usually strongly\n",

For ellipsoidal\nend-chamber closures, the local stress varies with the position along the surface,\nand the maximum stress is larger than that of a hemisphere. The radial displace-\nment of a cylinder end is not the same as that of a hemispherical or ellipsoidal\nclosure if computed by thin-shell theory. Thus a discontinuity exists which causes\nsome shearing and bending stresses. Similarly, a boss for the attachment of an\nigniter, a pressure gauge, or a nozzle can make it necessary for bending and shear\nstresses to be superimposed on the simple tension stresses of the case. In these\n\nlocations it is necessary to reinforce or thicken the chamber wall locally.\n\nFinite element computerized stress analysis programs are used in motor design\ncompanies today to determine the case design configuration with reasonable stress\nvalues. This analysis must be done simultaneously with the stress analysis on the\ngrain (since it imposes loads on the case), and with a finite element thermal\nanalysis to determine thermal stresses and deformations, since these analyses are\ninterdependent on each other.\n\nThe fast heating of the inner wall surface produces a large temperature gradient\nand therefore thermal stresses across the wall. The theory of transient heat transfer\nhas been treated by a number of authors, and, by means of a relaxation method,\na reasonable approximation of the temperature-time history at any location may\nbe obtained. The inner wall of the case, which is exposed to hot gas, is usually\nprotected by thermal insulation, as described in Section 13.6. Therefore the heat\ntransfer to the case is very low. In fact, for a single operation (not two thrust\nperiods) it is the designer\u2019s aim to keep the case temperatures near ambient or\nat the most 100\u00b0C above ambient.\n",
    "577": "560 SOLID ROCKET COMPONENTS AND MOTOR DESIGN\nThe case design has to provide means for attaching a nozzle (rarely more than\none nozzle), for attaching it to the vehicle, igniters, and provisions for loading\nthe grain. Sometimes there are also attached aerodynamic surfaces (fins), sensing\ninstruments, a raceway (external conduit for electrical wires), handling hooks,\nand thrust vector control actuators with their power supply. For upper stages of\nballistic missiles the case can also include blow-out ports or thrust termination\ndevices, as described in Chapter 14. Typical methods for attaching these items\ninclude tapered or straight multiple pins, snap rings, or bolts. Gaskets and/or\nO-ring seals prevent gas leaks.\nMetal Cases\nMetal cases have several advantages compared to filament-reinforced plastic\ncases: they are rugged and will take considerable rough handling (required in\nmany tactical missile applications), are usually reasonably ductile and can yield\nbefore failure, can be heated to a relatively high temperature (700 to 1000\u00b0C or\n1292 to 1832\u00b0F and higher with some special materials), and thus require less\ninsulation. They will not deteriorate significantly with time or weather exposure\nand are easily adapted to take concentrated loads, if made thicker at a flange\nor boss. Since the metal case has much higher density and less insulation, it\noccupies less volume than does a fiber-reinforced plastic case; therefore, for the\nsame external envelope it can contain somewhat more propellant.\nFigure 15\u20141 shows the various sections of a typical large solid rocket case\nmade of welded steel.

For very large and long motors both the propellant grain and the\nmotor case are made in sections; the case segments are mechanically attached and\nsealed to each other at the launch site. The segmented solid rocket booster for the\nSpace Shuttle is shown in Fig. 15-2 and discussed in Ref. 15\u20141. For the critical\nseal between the segments a multiple-O-ring joint is often used, as shown in\nFig. 15-3 and discussed in Ref. 15\u20142. Segments are used when an unsegmented\nmotor would be too large and too heavy to be transported over ordinary roads\n(cannot make turns) or railways (will not go through some tunnels or under some\nbridges) and are often too difficult to fabricate.\n\nSmall metal cases for tactical missile motors can be extruded or forged (and\nsubsequently machined), or made in three pieces as shown in Fig. 12\u20144. This case\nis designed for loading a freestanding grain and the case, nozzle, and blast tube\nare sealed by O-rings (see Chapter 6 of Ref. 15-3 and Chapter 7 of Ref. 15-4).\nSince the mission velocities for most tactical missiles are relatively low (100 to\n1500 m/sec), their propellant mass fractions are also relatively low (0.5 to 0.8)\nand the percentage of inert motor mass is high. Safety factors for tactical missile\ncases are often higher to allow for rough handling and cumulative damage. The\nemphasis in selecting motor cases (and other hardware components) for tactical\nmissiles is therefore not on highest performance (lowest inert motor mass), but\non reliability, long life, low cost, safety, ruggedness, or survivability.\n\nHigh-strength alloy steels have been the most common case metals, but others,\nlike aluminum, titanium, and nickel alloys, have also been used.

Extensive knowledge exists for\ndesigning and fabricating motor cases with low-alloy steels with strength levels\nto 240,000 psi.\n\nThe maraging steels have strengths up to approximately 300,000 psi in com-\nbination with high fracture toughness. The term maraging is derived from the\nfact that these alloys exist as relative soft low-carbon martensites in the annealed\ncondition and gain high strength from aging at relatively low temperatures.\n\nStress-corrosion cracking of certain metals presents a unique problem which\ncan result in spontaneous failure without any visual evidence of impending catas-\ntrophe. Emphasis given to lightweight thin metal cases aggravates stress corrosion\nand crack propagation, often starting from a flaw in the metal, with failure occur-\nring at a stress level below the yield strength of the metal.\nWound-Filament-Reinforced Plastic Cases\nFilament-reinforced cases use continuous filaments of strong fibers wound in\nprecise patterns and bonded together with a plastic, usually an epoxy resin. Their\nprincipal advantage is their lower weight. Most plastics soften when they are\nheated above about 180\u00b0C or 355\u00b0F; they need inserts or reinforcements to allow\nfastening or assembly of other components and to accept concentrated loads. The\nthermal expansion of reinforced plastics is often higher than that of metal and\nthe thermal conductivity is much lower, causing a higher temperature gradient.\nReferences 15-3 and 15-4 explain the design and winding of these composite\ncases, and Ref. 15\u20145 discusses their damage tolerance.\n",
    "580": "15.1. MOTOR CASE 563\n\nTypical fiber materials are, in the order of increasing strength, glass, aramids\n(Kevlar), and carbon, as listed in Table 15-2. Typically, the inert mass of a case\nmade of carbon fiber is about 50% of a case made with glass fibers and around\n67% of a case mass made with Kevlar fibers.\n\nIndividual fibers are very strong in tension (2400 to 6800 MPa or 350,000\nto 1,000,000 psi). The fibers are held in place by a plastic binder of relatively\nlow density; it prevents fibers slipping and thus weakening in shear or bending.\nIn a filament-wound composite (with tension, hoop, and bending stresses) the\nfilaments are not always oriented along the direction of maximum stress and\nthe material includes a low-strength plastic; therefore, the composite strength is\nreduced by a factor of 3 to 5 compared to the strength of the filament itself. The\nplastic binder is usually a thermosetting epoxy material, which limits the maxi-\nmum temperature to between 100 and 180\u00b0C or about 212 and 355\u00b0F. Although\nresins with higher temperature limits are available (295\u00b0C or 563\u00b0F), their adhe-\nsion to the fibers has not been as strong. The safety factors used (in deterministic\nstructural analysis) are typically for failure to occur at 1.4 to 1.6 times the maxi-\nmum operating stress, and proof testing is done to 1.15 to 1.25 times the operating\npressure.\n\nA typical case design is shown schematically in Fig. 15\u20144. The forward end,\naft end, and cylindrical portion are wound on a preform or mold which already\ncontains the forward and aft rings. The direction in which the bands are laid onto\nthe mold and the tension that is applied to the bands is critical in obtaining a good\ncase. The curing is done in an oven and may be done under pressure to assure\nhigh density and minimum voids of the composite material.

Since filament-wound\ncase walls can be porous, they must be sealed. The liner between the case and the\ngrain can be the seal that prevents hot gases from seeping through the case walls.\nScratches, dents, and moisture absorption can degrade the strength of the case.\n\nIn some designs the insulator is placed on the preform before winding and\nthe case is cured simultaneously with the insulator, as seen in Ref. 15-6. In\nanother design the propellant grain with its forward and aft closures is used as\nthe preform. A liner is applied to this grain, then an insulator, and the high-\nstrength fibers of the case are wound in layers directly over the insulated live\npropellant. Curing has to be done at a relatively low temperature so that the\npropellant will not be adversely affected. This process works well with extruded\ncylindrical grains. There are also cylindrical cases made of steel with an overwrap\nlayer of filament-wound composite material, as described in Ref. 15-7.\n\nThe allowable stresses are usually determined from tensile tests of a roving or\nband and rupture tests on subscale composite cases made by an essentially iden-\ntical filament winding process. Some companies reduce the allowable strength\nto account for the degradation due to moisture, manufacturing imperfections, or\nnonuniform density.\n\nIn a motor case the filaments must be oriented in the direction of principal\nstress and must be proportioned in number to the magnitude of stress. Com-\npromise occurs around parts needed for nozzles, igniters, and so on, and then\norientation is kept as close to the ideal as is practicable. Filaments are customar-\nily clustered in yarns, rovings, or bands, as defined in Fig. 15\u20145. By using two\nor more winding angles (i.e., helicals and circumferentials) and calculating the\nproportion of filaments in each direction, a balanced stress structure is achieved.\nThe ideal in balance is for each fiber in each direction to carry an equal load\n(tension only). Realistically, the filaments supported by the epoxy resin must\nabsorb stress compression, bending loads, cross-laminar shear, and interlaminar\nshear. Even though the latter stresses are small compared to the tensile stress,\neach must be examined by analysis since each can lead to case failure before a\nfilament fails in tension. In a proper design, failure occurs when the filaments\nreach their ultimate tensile strength, rather than because of stresses in other direc-\ntions.

Typical throat diameters are\nbetween 0.25 and 5 in. for tactical missile nozzles and approximately 10 in.\nfor some strap-on motors. Fixed nozzles are generally not submerged (see\nbelow) and do not provide thrust vector control (although there are excep-\ntions). See Fig. 15-7.\n\n2. Movable Nozzle. Provides thrust vector control for the flight vehicle. As\nexplained in Chapter 18, one movable nozzle can provide pitch and yaw\ncontrol and two are needed for roll control. Movable nozzles are typically\nsubmerged and use a flexible sealed joint or bearing with two actuators\n",

Submerged Nozzles. A significant portion of the nozzle structure is sub-\nmerged within the combustion chamber or case, as shown in Figs. 15-2\nand 15-6b,c. Submerging the nozzle reduces the overall motor length\nsomewhat, which in turn reduces the vehicle length and its inert mass.\nIt is important for length-limited applications such as silo- and submarine-\nlaunched strategic missiles as well as their upper stages, and space motor\npropulsion systems. It also reduces the mass of propellant inside the case.\nReference 15-8 describes the sloshing of trapped molten aluminum oxide\n",

Commonly referred to as an extendible exit cone, (EEC),\nalthough it is not always exactly conical. It is used on strategic missile\npropulsion upper-stage systems and upper stages for space launch vehicles\nto maximize motor-delivered specific impulse. As shown in Fig. 12-3,\nit has a fixed low-area-ratio nozzle section which is enlarged to a higher\narea ratio by adding a nozzle cone extension piece. The extended nozzle\nimproves specific impulse by doubling or tripling the initial expansion\nratio, thereby significantly increasing the nozzle thrust coefficient. This\nsystem thus allows a very high expansion ratio nozzle to be packaged in a\nrelatively short length, thereby reducing vehicle inert mass. The nozzle cone\nextension is in its retracted position during the boost phase of the flight and\nis moved into place before the motor is started but after separation from\nthe lower stage. Typically, electromechanical ball screw actuators deploy\nthe exit cone extension.\n\n5. Blast-Tube-Mounted Nozzle. Used with tactical air- and ground-launched\nmissiles. with diameter constraints to allow space for aerodynamic fin actu-\nation or TVC power supply systems. The blast tube also allows the rocket\nmotor\u2019s center of gravity (CG) to be close to or ahead of the vehicle CG.\nThis limits the CG travel during motor burn and makes flight stabilization\nmuch easier.\n\nEach motor usually has a single nozzle. A few larger motors have had four\nmovable nozzles, which are used for thrust vector control (see Chapter 18).\nDesign and Construction\nAlmost all solid rocket nozzles are ablatively cooled. The general construction\nof a solid rocket nozzle features steel or aluminum shells (housings) designed to\ncarry structural loads (motor operating pressure and nozzle TVC actuator load\nare usually the biggest), and composite ablative liners which are bonded to the\nhousings. The ablative liners are designed to insulate the steel or aluminum hous-\nings, provide the internal aerodynamic contour necessary to efficiently expand\ncombustion gases to generate thrust, and to ablate and char in a controlled and pre-\ndictable manner to prevent the buildup of heat which could substantially weaken\nthe structural housings or the bonding materials. Solid rocket nozzles are designed\nto ensure that the thickness of ablative liners is sufficient to maintain the liner-\nto-housing adhesive bond line below the temperature that would degrade the\nadhesive structural properties during motor operation. Nozzle designs are shown\nin Figs. 1-5, 12-1 to 12-4, and 15-7.\n\nThe construction of nozzles ranges from simple single-piece nonmovable\ngraphite nozzles to complex multipiece nozzles capable of moving to control\nthe direction of the thrust vector.

ITE nozzle inserts can be seen in Figs. 1-5, 12-1, 12-3,\nand 12-4.\n\nNozzle throat erosion causes the throat diameter to enlarge during operation\nand is one of the problems encountered in nozzle design. Usually, a throat area\nincrease larger than 5% is considered unacceptable for most solid rocket appli-\ncations, since it causes a significant reduction in thrust and chamber pressure.\nErosion occurs not only at the throat region (typically, at 0.01 to 0.25 mm/sec or\n0.004 to 0.010 in./sec), but also at the sections immediately upstream and down-\nstream of the throat region, as shown in Fig. 15\u201410. Nozzle assemblies typically\nlose 3 to 12% of their initial inert mass during operation. Erosion is caused by\nthe complex interaction between the high-temperature, high-velocity gas flow,\nthe chemically aggressive species in the gas, and the mechanical abrasion by\nparticles. The carbon in the nozzle material reacts with species like O2, O, OH,\nor H20 and is oxidized; the cumulative concentration of these species is an indi-\ncation of the likely erosion. Tables 5\u20146 and 5-7 give chemical concentrations\nfor the exhaust species from aluminized propellant. Fuel-rich propellants (which\ncontain little free O2 or O) and propellants where some of the gaseous oxygen\nis removed by aluminum oxidation show less tendency to cause erosion. Uneven\nerosion of a nozzle causes thrust misalignment.\n\nFinding the optimum nozzle wall contour requires an analysis (computer codes\nfor bell-shaped nozzles using the method of characteristics are mentioned in\nSection 3.4) to determine the wall contour which most rapidly turns the gas to\nnear axial flow without introducing shock waves or impinging excessive alu-\nminum oxide (Al.O3) particles on the nozzle wall. Figure 3-14 illustrates the\nkey parameters which govern design of the nozzle contour; the initial angle 6;\n(angle through which supersonic flow is turned immediately downstream of the\nnozzle throat), the throat to exit plane length L, the exit plane exit angle 6,,\nand the turnback angle 6; \u2014 @.. With solid or liquid particles in the exhaust the\nimpingement can be minimized with an initial angle typically between 20 and 26\u00b0\nand a turnback angle of typically 10 to 15\u00b0. The length reduction of a bell-shaped\nnozzle (with solid particles in the gas) is typically 80 to 90% of the length of an\nequivalent conical nozzle with 15\u00b0 half angle. The nozzle throat inlet contour is\ngenerally based on a hyperbolic spiral that uniformly accelerates the combustion\ngas flow to supersonic velocity at the throat plane.\n\nHeat Absorption and Nozzle Materials\n\nRocket motors never reach thermal equilibrium during their firing. The temper-\natures of all components exposed to the heat flow increase continuously during\noperation. In a good thermal design the critical locations reach a maximum\nallowable temperature a short time after the motor stops running. The nozzle\n",

The maximum allowable temperature for\nany of the motor materials is just below the temperature at which excessive\ndegradation occurs (the material loses strength, melts, becomes too soft, cracks,\npyrolyses, unglues, oxidizes too rapidly). The operating duration is limited by\nthe design and amount of heat-absorbing and insulating material pieces. Stated\nin a different way, the objective is to design a nozzle with just sufficient heat-\nabsorbing material mass and insulation mass at the various locations within the\nnozzle, so that its structures and joints will do the job for the duration of the\napplication under all likely operating conditions.\n\nThe selection and application of the proper material is the key to the success-\nful design of a solid rocket nozzle. Table 15\u20144 groups various typical nozzle\nmaterials according to their usage. The high-temperature exhaust of solid rock-\nets presents an unusually severe environment for the nozzle materials, especially\nwhen metalized propellants are employed.\n\nAbout 70 years ago nozzles were made out of a single piece of molded poly-\ncrystalline graphite and some were supported by metal housing structures. They\neroded easily, but were low in cost. We still use them today for short duration, low\nchamber pressure, low altitude flight applications of low thrust, such as in certain\ntactical missiles. For more severe conditions a throat insert or ITE (integrated\nthroat entrance) was placed into the graphite piece; this insert was a denser, bet-\nter grade of graphite; later pyrolytic graphite washers and fiber-reinforced carbon\nmaterials came into use. For a period of time tungsten inserts were used; they\nhad very good erosion resistance, but were heavy and often cracked. Pyrolytic\ngraphite was introduced and is still being used as washers for the throat insert\nof small nozzles, as shown in Fig. 15-7. The high-strength carbon fiber and the\ncarbon matrix were major advances in high-temperature materials. For small and\nmedium-sized nozzles, ITE pieces were then made of carbon\u2014carbon, which is\nan abbreviation for carbon fibers in a carbon matrix (see Ref. 15-9). The orien-\ntation of the fibers can be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D), as\ndescribed below. Some properties of all these materials are listed in Tables 15-4\nand 15-5. For large nozzles the then existing technology did not allow the fab-\nrication of large 3D carbon-carbon ITE pieces, so layups of carbon fiber (or\nsilicon fiber) cloth in a phenolic matrix were used.\n\nThe regions immediately upstream and downstream of the throat have less\nheat transfer, less erosion, and lower temperatures than the throat region, and\nless expensive materials are usually satisfactory. This includes various grades\nof graphite, or ablative materials, strong high-temperature fibers (carbon or sil-\nica) in a matrix of phenolic or epoxy resins, which are described later in this\nsection. Figure 18\u20145 shows a movable nozzle with multilayer insulators behind\nthe graphite nozzle pieces directly exposed to heat. These insulators (between the\nvery hot throat piece and housing) limit the heat transfer and prevent excessive\nhousing temperatures.\n",

This\nexit segment can be built integral with the nozzle throat segment (as it is in most\nsmall nozzles), or it can be a separate one- or two-piece subassembly which is\nthen fastened to the smaller diameter throat segment. Ablative materials without\noriented fibers as in cloth or ribbons, but with short fibers or insulating ceramic\nparticles, can be used here. For large area ratios (upper stages and space transfer),\nthe nozzle will often protrude beyond the vehicle\u2019s boat tail surface. This allows\nradiation cooling, since the exposed exit cone can reject heat by radiation to\nspace. Lightweight thin high-temperature metals (niobium, titanium, stainless\nsteel, or a thin carbon-carbon shell) with radiation cooling have been used in\na few upper-stage or spacecraft exit cone applications. Since radiation-cooled\nnozzle exit sections can reach thermal equilibrium, their duration is unlimited.\n\nThe housing or structural support of the nozzle uses the same material as the\nmetal case, such as steel or aluminum. Housings are never allowed to become\nvery hot. Some of the simpler, smaller nozzles (with one, two, or three pieces,\nmostly graphite) do not have a separate housing structure, but use the ITE for\nthe structure.\n\nEstimates of nozzle internal temperatures and temperature distributions with\ntime can be made using two-dimensional finite element difference methods for\ntransient heat transfer analyses. These are similar in principle to the transient\nheat transfer method described in Section 8.5 and shown in Fig. 8\u201420. After\nfiring, the nozzle temperatures reach an equilibrium value by conducting heat\nfrom the hotter inner parts, which were exposed to the hot gas, to the cooler\nouter pieces. Sometimes the outer pieces will exceed their limit temperatures and\nsuffer damage after firing. The structural analysis (stresses and strains) of the key\nnozzle components is dependent on the heat transfer analysis, which determines\nthe component temperatures. This allows use of the proper material physical\nproperties, which are temperature dependent. The design must also allow for the\nthermal growth and the differential expansion of adjacent parts.\n\nTypical materials used for the ITE or nozzle throat insert are listed in\nTable 15-5. They are exposed to the most severe conditions of heat transfer,\nthermal stresses, and high temperatures. Their physical properties are often\nanisotropic; that is, their properties vary with the orientation or direction of the\ncrystal structure or the direction of reinforcing fibers. Polycrystalline graphites\nare extruded or molded. Different grades with different densities and capabilities\nare available. As already mentioned, they are used extensively for simple\nnozzles and for ITE parts. Pyrolytic graphite is strongly anisotropic and has\nexcellent conductivity in a preferred direction. A nozzle using it is shown in\nFig. 15-7. It is fabricated by depositing graphite crystals on a substratum in a\nfurnace containing methane gas. Its use is declining, but it is still installed in\ncurrent rocket motors of older design.\n\nThe carbon-carbon material is made from carefully oriented sets of carbon\nfibers (woven, knitted, threaded, or laid up in patterns) in a carbon matrix. Two-\ndimensional (2D) material has fibers in two directions, 3D has fibers oriented in\n",
    "593": "576 SOLID ROCKET COMPONENTS AND MOTOR DESIGN\n\nthree directions (usually at right angle to each other), and 4D has an extra set\nof fibers at about a 45\u00b0 angle to one or two of the other three directions. An\norganic liquid resin is injected into the spaces between the fibers. The assembly\nis pressurized, the filler is transformed into a carbon char by heating and is\ncompacted by further injection and densification processes. The graphitization is\nthen performed at temperatures higher than 2000\u00b0C. This material is expensive\nbut suited to nozzle applications. Highly densified material is superior in high\nheat transfer regions, such as the throat. The multidirectional fiber reinforcements\nallow them to better withstand the high thermal stresses introduced by the steep\ntemperature gradients within the component.\n\nAblative Materials. These are not only commonly used in the nozzles of rocket\nmotors but also in some insulation materials. They are usually a composite mate-\nrial of high-temperature organic or inorganic high-strength fibers, namely high\nsilica glass, aramids (Kevlar), or carbon fibers, impregnated with organic plastic\nmaterials such as phenolic or epoxy resin. The fibers may be individual strands\nor bands (applied in a geometric pattern on a winding machine), or come as a\nwoven cloth or ribbon, all impregnated with resin.\n\nThe ablation process is a combination of surface melting, sublimation,\ncharring, evaporation, decomposition in depth, and film cooling. As shown in\nFig. 15-11, progressive layers of the ablative material undergo an endothermic\ndegradation, that is, physical and chemical changes that absorb heat. While some\nof the ablative material evaporates (and some types also have a viscous liquid\nphase), enough charred and porous solid material remains on and below the\nsurface to preserve the basic geometry and surface integrity. Upon rocket start\nthe ablative material acts like any thermal heat sink, but the poor conductivity\ncauses the surface temperature to rise rapidly. At 650 to 800 K some of the\nresins start to decompose endothermically into a porous carbonaceous char and\npyrolysis gases. As the char depth increases, these gases undergo an endothermic\ncracking process as they percolate through the char in a counterflow direction to\nthe heat flux. These gases then form an artificial fuel-rich, protective, relatively\ncool, but flimsy boundary layer over the char.\n\nBefore Typical Direction of combustion\noperation temperatures gas flow [Hot combustion gas\nduring \u2014 Relatively cool gas\noperation \u2014 _E layer-mostly pyrolysis,\nSSE < gases, some liquids\nWRRRKNYE 1000\" VID FFF FI Porous char layer\nVirgin RIQQ@c 500% (usually black carbon)\nWe WORRRWY\nablative RRARAVV GY yf | Reaction zone (generates\nmaterial RRR 100 LOOKER) BET aE\nMetal wall ZI 289\u00b0 LMM\nFIGURE 15-11.

    "594": "15.2. NOZZLES 577\n\nSince char is almost all carbon and can withstand 3500 K or 6000 R, the\nporous char layer allows the original surface to be maintained (but with a rough\nsurface texture) and provides geometric integrity, alternatively the char\u2019s carbon\ncan be oxidized by certain species in the combustion gas; in this case there is\na slow regression of the charred surface. Char is a weak material and can be\ndamaged or abraded by direct impingement of solid particles in the gas. Ablative\nmaterial construction is used for part or all of the chambers and/or nozzles shown\nin Figs. 1-5, 6-10, 12\u20141 to 12\u20144, and 15-10.\n\nAblative parts are formed either by high-pressure molding (~ 55 to 69 MPa or\n8000 to 10,000 psi at 149\u00b0C or 300\u00b0F) or by tapewrapping on a shaped mandrel\nfollowed by an autoclave curing process at 1000 to 2000 psi pressure and 300\u00b0F\ntemperature. Tapewrapping is a common method of forming very large nozzles.\nThe wrapping procedure normally includes heating the shaped mandrel (~ 54\u00b0C\nor 130\u00b0F), heating the tape and resin (66 to 121\u00b0C or 150 to 250\u00b0F), pressure\nrolling the tape of fiber material and the injected resin in place while rolling\n(~ 35,000 N/m or 200 Ibf/in. width), and maintaining the proper rolling speed,\ntape tension, wrap orientation, and resin flow rate. Experience has proven that\nas-wrapped density is an important indicator of procedural acceptability, with the\ndesired criterion being near 90% of the autoclaved density. Resin content usually\nranges between 25 and 35%, depending on the fabric-reinforcing material and\nthe particular resin and its filler material. Normally, the mechanical properties of\nthe cured ablative material, and also the durability of the material during rocket\noperation, correlate closely with the cured material density. Within an optimal\ndensity range, low density usually means poor bonding of the reinforcing layers,\nhigh porosity, low strength, and high erosion rate.\n\nIn liquid propellant rockets, ablatives have been effective in very small thrust\nchambers (where there is insufficient regenerative cooling capacity), in pulsing,\nrestartable spacecraft control rocket engines, in the exit region of large nozzle\nand in variable-thrust (throttled) rocket engines. Figure 6\u201410 shows an ablative\nnozzle extension for a large liquid propellant rocket engine.\n\nThe heat transfer properties of the many available ablative and other fiber-\nbased materials will depend on their design, composition, and construction.\nFigure 15-12 shows several common fiber orientation and approaches.

When perpendicular to the gas flow,\nthe heat transfer to the wall interior is high because of the short conducting path.\nGood results have been obtained when the fibers are at 40 to 60\u00b0 relative to the\ngas flow over the surface. Fabrication variables present wide variations in nozzle\nlife for a given design; the variables include the method of wrapping, molding,\nand curing, resin batch processes, and resin sources.\n15.3. IGNITER HARDWARE\nIn Section 14.2 the process of ignition was described, and in Section 13.5 some\nof the propellants used in igniters were mentioned briefly. In this section we\ndiscuss specific igniter types, locations, and their hardware (see Ref. 15-10).\nSince the igniter propellant mass is small (often less than 1% of the motor\npropellant) and burns mostly at low chamber pressure (low /,), it contributes\nvery little to the motor overall total impulse. It is the designer\u2019s aim to reduce\nthe igniter propellant mass and the igniter inert hardware mass to a minimum,\njust big enough to assure ignition of the grain under all operating conditions.\nFigure 15-13 shows several alternative locations for the igniter. When\nmounted on the forward end, the gas flow over the propellant surface helps\nto achieve ignition. With aft mounting there is little gas motion, particularly\nnear the forward end; here ignition must rely on the temperature, pressure, and\nheat transfer from the igniter gas. If mounted internally through the nozzle,\nthe igniter hardware and its support are discarded shortly after the igniter has\nused all its propellants and there is no inert mass penalty for the igniter case.\nThere are two basic types: pyrotechnic igniters and pyrogen igniters; both are\ndiscussed below.\nPyrotechnic Igniters\nIn industrial practice, pyrotechnic igniters are defined as igniters (other than\npyrogen-type igniters) using solid explosives or energetic propellant-like chemical\nPa]\nEf S_\n| caeememncon Fa [aes ae\nAft, internal Aft, external\nESS =e\naay ee\nForward, internal Forward, external\n(supported by nozzle exit cone)\n\nFIGURE 15-13.

This definition fits\na wide variety of designs, known as bag and carbon igniters, powder can, plastic\ncase, pellet basket, perforated tube, combustible case, jellyroll, string, or sheet\nigniters. The common pellet-basket design shown in Fig. 15-14 is typical of the\npyrotechnic igniters. Ignition of the main charge, in this case pellets consisting of\n24% boron\u201471% potassium perchlorate\u20145% binder, is accomplished by stages;\nfirst, on receipt of an electrical signal the initiator releases the energy of a small\namount of sensitive powdered pyrotechnic housed within the initiator, commonly\ncalled the squib or the primer charge; next, the booster charge is ignited by heat\nreleased from the squib; and finally, the main ignition charge propellants are\nignited.\n\nA special form of pyrotechnic igniter is the surface-bonded or grain-mounted\nigniter. Such an igniter has its initiator included within a sandwich of flat sheets;\nthe layer touching the grain is the main charge of pyrotechnic. This form of\nigniter is used with multipulse motors with two or more end-burning grains. The\nignition of the second and successive pulses of these motors presents unusual\nrequirements for available space, compatibility with the grain materials, life,\nand the pressure and temperature resulting from the booster grain operation.\nAdvantages of the sheet igniter include light weight, low volume, and high heat\nflux at the grain surface. Any inert material employed (such as wires and electric\nceramic insulators) is usually blown out of the motor nozzle during ignition and\ntheir impacts have caused damage to the nozzle or plugged it, particularly if they\nare not intentionally broken up into small pieces.\n",
    "597": "580 SOLID ROCKET COMPONENTS AND MOTOR DESIGN\n\nPyrogen Igniters\n\nA pyrogen igniter is basically a small rocket motor that is used to ignite a larger\nrocket motor. The pyrogen is not designed to produce thrust. All use one or\nmore nozzle orifices, both sonic and supersonic types, and most use conventional\nrocket motor grain formulations and design technology. Heat transfer from the\npyrogen to the motor grain is largely convective, with the hot gases contacting\nthe grain surface as contrasted to a highly radiative energy emitted by pyrotechnic\nigniters. Figures 12-1, 12\u20142, and 12\u201420 illustrate rocket motors with a typical\npyrogen igniter. The igniter in Fig. 18\u20145 has three nozzles and a cylindrical grain\nwith high-burn-rate propellant. For pyrogen igniters the initiator and the booster\ncharge are very similar to the designs used in pyrotechnic igniters. Reaction\nproducts from the main charge impinge on the surface of the rocket motor grain,\nproducing motor ignition. Common practice on the very large motors is to mount\nexternally, with the pyrogen igniter pointing its jet up through the large motor\nnozzle. In this case, the igniter becomes a piece of ground-support equipment.\n\nTwo approaches are commonly used to safeguard against motor misfires, or\ninadvertent motor ignition; one is the use of the classical safe and arm device and\nthe second is the design of safeguards into the initiator. Energy for unintentional\nignition\u2014usually a disaster when it happens\u2014can be (1) static electricity, (2)\ninduced current from electromagnetic radiation, such as radar, (3) induced elec-\ntrical currents from ground test equipment, communication apparatus, or nearby\nelectrical circuits in the flight vehicle, and (4) heat, vibration, or shock from han-\ndling and operations. Functionally, the safe and arm device serves as an electrical\nswitch to keep the igniter circuit grounded and interrupted when not operating;\nin some designs it also mechanically misaligns or blocks the ignition train of\nevents so that unwanted ignition is precluded even though the initiator fires.\nWhen the device is transposed into the arm position, the ignition circuit is no\nlonger blocked and the ignition flame can be reliably propagated to the igniter\u2019s\nbooster and main charges.\n\nElectric initiators in motor igniters are also called squibs, glow plugs, primers,\nand headers; they always constitute the initial element in the ignition train and, if\nproperly designed, can be a safeguard against unintended ignition. Three typical\ndesigns of initiators are shown in Fig. 15-15. Both (a) and (b) structurally\nform a part of the rocket motor case and generically are headers. In the integral\ndiaphragm type (a) the initial ignition energy is passed in the form of a shock\nwave through the diaphragm activating the acceptor charge, with the diaphragm\nremaining integral. This same principle is also used to transmit a shock wave\nthrough a metal case wall or a metal insert in a filament-wound case; the case\nwould not need to be penetrated and sealed. The header type (b) resembles a\nsimple glow plug with two high-resistance bridgewires buried in the initiator\ncharge. The exploding bridgewire design (c) employs a small bridgewire (0.02\nto 0.10 mm) of low-resistance material, usually platinum or gold, that is exploded\nby application of a high-voltage discharge.\n\nThe safeguard aspect of the initiator appears as a basic design feature in\nthe form of (1) minimum threshold electrical energy required for activation, (2)\n",

In general, the analytical\nmodels of the physical and chemical processes that must be considered in the\ndesign of igniters are far from complete and accurate. See Chapter 5 by Hermance\nand Chapter 6 by Kumar and Kuo in Ref. 14-1, and Ref. 15-10.\n\nAnalysis and design of igniters, regardless of the type, depend heavily on\nexperimental results, including past successes and failures with full-scale motors.\nThe effect of some of the important parameters has become quite predictable,\nusing data from developed motors. For example, Fig. 15-16 is of benefit in\nestimating the mass of igniter main charge for motors of various sizes (motor\nfree volume).

ROCKET MOTOR DESIGN APPROACH\nAlthough there are some common elements in the design of all solid propellant\nrocket motors, there is no universal, well-defined procedure or design method.\nEach class of application has some different requirements. Individual design-\ners and their organizations have different approaches, background experiences,\nsequences of steps, or emphasis. The approach also varies with the amount of\navailable data on design issues, propellants, grains, hardware, or materials, with\nthe degree of novelty (many \u201cnew\u201d motors are actually modifications of proven\nexisting motors), or the available computer programs.\nUsually the following items are part of the preliminary design process. We\nstart with the requirements for the flight vehicle and the motor, such as those\nlisted in Table 15-6. If the motor to be designed has some similarities to proven\nexisting motors, their parameters and flight experience will be helpful in reducing\nthe design effort and enhancing the confidence in the design. The selection of the\npropellant and the grain configuration are usually made early in the preliminary\ndesign; propellant selection was discussed in Chapter 13 and grains in Chapter 12.\nTABLE 15-6.

    "601": "584 SOLID ROCKET COMPONENTS AND MOTOR DESIGN\n\nIt is not always easy for any one propellant to satisfy the three key requirements,\nnamely the performance (/,), burning rate to suit the thrust\u2014time curve, and\nstrength (maximum stress and strain). A well-characterized propellant, a proven\ngrain configuration, or a well-tested piece of hardware will usually be preferred\nand is often modified somewhat to fit the new application.\n\nAn analysis of the structural integrity should be undertaken, at least in a few\nof the likely places, where stresses or strains might exceed those that can be\ntolerated by the grain or the other key components at the limits of loading or\nenvironmental conditions. An analysis of the nozzle should be done, particularly\nif the nozzle is complex or includes thrust vector control. Such a nozzle analysis\nwas described briefly in an earlier section of this chapter. If gas flow analysis\nshows that erosive burning is likely to happen during a portion of the burning\nduration, it must be decided whether it can be tolerated, or whether it is excessive\nand a modification of the propellant, the nozzle material, or the grain geometry\nneeds to be made. Usually a preliminary evaluation is also done of the resonances\nof the grain cavity with the aim of identifying possible combustion instability\nmodes (see Chapter 14). Motor performance analysis, heat transfer, and stress\nanalyses in critical locations will usually be done.\n\nThere is considerable interdependence and feedback between the propellant\nformulation, grain geometry/design, stress analysis, thermal analysis, major hard-\nware component designs, and their manufacturing processes. It is difficult to\nfinalize one of these without considering all the others, and there may be several\niterations of each. Data from tests of laboratory samples, subscale motors, and\nfull-scale motors have a strong influence on these steps.\n\nPreliminary layout drawings or CAD (computer-aided design) images of the\nmotor with its key components will be made in sufficient detail to provide\nsizes and reasonably accurate dimensions. For example, a preliminary design\nof the thermal insulation (often with a heat transfer analysis) will provide pre-\nliminary dimensions for that insulator. The layout is used to estimate volumes,\ninert masses, or propellant masses, and thus the propellant mass fraction.\n\nIf any of these analyses or layouts show a potential problem or a possible\nfailure to meet the initial requirements or constraints, then a modification of the\ndesign, possibly of the propellant, or of the grain configuration may need to be\nmade. The design process needs to be repeated with the changed motor design. If\nthe proposed changes are too complex or not effective, then a change in the motor\nrequirements may be the cure to a particular problem of noncompliance with the\nrequirements. It is common to have several iterations between the preliminary\ndesign and the final design. Any major new feature can result in additional\ndevelopment and testing to prove its performance, reliability, operation, or cost;\nthis means a longer program and extra resources.\n\nA simplified diagram of one particular approach to motor preliminary design\nand development activities for a rocket motor is shown in Fig. 15-17. Not\nshown in this diagram are many other steps, such as igniter design and tests,\nliner/insulating selection, thrust vector control design and test, reliability analy-\nsis, evaluation of alternative designs, material specifications, inspection/quality\n",

These, in turn, reflect them-\nselves into tolerances in process specifications, specific inspections, dimensional\ntolerances, or accuracy of propellant ingredient weighing. Cost is always a major\nfactor and a portion of the design effort will be spent looking for lower-cost\nmaterials, simpler manufacturing processes, fewer assembly steps, or lower-cost\ncomponent designs. For example, tooling for casting, mandrels for case wind-\ning, and tooling for insulator molding can be expensive. The time needed for\ncompleting a design can be shortened when there is good communication and\na cooperative spirit between designers, propellant specialists, analysts, customer\nrepresentatives, manufacturing people, test personnel, or vendors concerned with\nthis effort. Reference 15-13 deals with some of the uncertainties of a particular\nbooster motor design, and Ref. 15\u201414 discusses design optimization.\n\nA preliminary project plan is usually formulated simultaneously with the pre-\nliminary design work. A decade or more ago the project plan was made after the\npreliminary design was completed. With today\u2019s strong emphasis on low cost, the\npeople working on the preliminary designs have also to work on reducing costs on\nall components and processes. The project plan reflects decisions and defines the\nnumber of motors and key components to be built, the availability and lead time\nof critical materials or components, the type and number of tests (including aging\nor qualification tests); it identifies the manufacturing, inspection, and test facili-\nties to be used, the number and kind of personnel (and when they will be needed),\nor any special tooling or fixtures. These decisions and data are needed to make a\nrealistic estimate of cost and a preliminary schedule. If these exceed the allowable\ncost or the desired delivery schedule, then some changes have to be made. For\nexample, this may include changes in the number of units to be built, the number\nand types of tests, or a redesign for easier, less costly assembly. However, such\nchanges must not compromise reliability or performance. It is difficult to make\na good plan, and good cost or time estimates, when the rocket motor has not\nbeen well defined or designed in sufficient detail. These plans and estimates are\ntherefore largely based on experience with prior successful similar rocket motors.\n\nThe final result of a preliminary design will be layout drawings or CAD images\nof the selected configuration, a prediction of performance, an estimate of motor\nmass (and, if needed, also the travel of the center of gravity), an identification of\nthe propellant, grain, geometry, insulation, and several of the key materials of the\nhardware components. An estimate of predicted reliability and motor life would\nbe accompanied by supporting data. All this information would be presented for\nreview of the selected preliminary design. The review would be undertaken by a\ndiverse group of motor experts, the vehicle designer, safety engineers, specialists\nin manufacturing, assembly, or inspection, customer representatives, analysts,\nand others. Here the preliminary design team explains why they selected their\nparticular design and how it meets the requirements. With competent reviewers\nthere usually will be suggestions for changes or further improvements. The project\nplan, preliminary cost estimates, and preliminary schedule are sometimes included\nwith the design review, but more often these are presented to a different group\nof experts, or just to the customer\u2019s experts.\n",
    "604": "15.4. ROCKET MOTOR DESIGN APPROACH 587\nAfter the design review and the approval of the selected preliminary design,\nthe detail or final design of all parts and components and the writing of cer-\ntain specifications can begin. During manufacture and development testing some\ndesign changes may become necessary to improve the manufacture, reduce cost,\nor remedy a technical problem that became evident. In many organizations the\nfinal, detailed design is again submitted to a design review before manufacturing\ncan begin. The new motor will then start its development testing. In some larger,\nexpensive motors, that have a lot of heritage from prior proven motors, the devel-\nopment may consist of a single motor firing. For motors which are built in large\nquantities and for motors with major new features, the development and qualifi-\ncation may involve the testing of 10 to 30 motors. The final design ends when all\ndetail drawings or CAD images and a final parts list are completed, and specifica-\ntions for motor testing, certain manufacturing operations, or materials/component\nacceptance have been prepared. The detail design is considered to be completed\nwhen the motor successfully passes its development and qualification tests and\nbegins production.\nExample 15-1. This example shows one method for making a preliminary determination\nof the design parameters of a solid rocket using a composite propellant. The rocket is\nlaunched at altitude and flies at constant altitude.

This example does not go through a preliminary\nstress and elongation analysis, but it should be done.\n\nd. Nozzle Design. From Chapter 3 the nozzle parameters can be determined. The thrust\ncoefficient Cr can be found from curves of Figs. 3-6, 3\u20147, and 3\u20148 or Eq. 3-30\nfor k = 1.25 and a pressure ratio of p;/p2 = 1000/3 = 333. Then Cr = 1.73. The\nthroat area is from Eq. 3-31:\n\nA; = F /piCr = 20,000/(1000 x 1.73) = 11.56 in.?\nThe throat diameter is D, = 3.836 in. The nozzle area ratio for optimum expansion\n(Fig. 3-6) A2/A; is about 27. The exit area and diameter are therefore about A, =\n312 in.? and D,. = 19.93 in. However, this is larger than the maximum vehicle\ndiameter of 16.0 in. (A> = 201 in.2), which is the maximum for the outside of the\nnozzle exit. Allowing for an exit cone thickness of 0.10 in., the internal nozzle exit\ndiameter Dy is 15.80 in. and A> is 196 in.2. This would allow only a maximum\narea ratio of 196/11.56 or 16.95. Since the Cr values are not changed appreciably\nfor this new area ratio, it can be assumed that the nozzle throat area is unchanged.\nThis nozzle can have a thin wall in the exit cone, but requires heavy ablative\nmaterials, probably in several layers near the throat and convergent nozzle regions.\n\nThe thermal and structural analysis of the nozzle is not shown here.\n\ne. Weight Estimate. The steel case weight (assume a cylinder with two spherical ends\n\nand that steel weight density is 0.3 Ibf/in.') is\ndxDLp + (x/4)dD*p = 0.072 x 15.83 x 38.24 x 0.3\n+ 0.785 x 0.072 x 15.83? x 0.3\n= 45.3 lbf\n\nWith attachments, flanges, igniter, and pressure tap bosses, this is increased to\n51 lbf. The nozzle weight is composed of the weights of the individual parts,\nestimated for their densities and geometries. This example does not go through the\ndetailed calculations, but merely gives the result of 30.2 Ibf. Assume an expended\nigniter propellant weight of 2.0 Ibf and a full igniter weight of 5.0 Ibf.

Since the total impulse is J, = F At = 20,000 x 5 = 100,000 Ibf-\nsec, the total impulse-to-weight ratio is 100,000/525.4 = 190.3.

Erosive Burning. The ratio of the port area to the nozzle throat area at start is\n(7.66/3.836)? = 3.97. This is close to the limit of 4.0, and erosive burning is not\nlikely to be significant. A simple analysis of erosive burning in the conical cavity\nshould also be made, but it is not shown here.\n\nWith partial loss of nozzle material and insulation, the thrust and nozzle area\nwill increase, the chamber pressure will decrease, and the specific impulse will be\nlower due to the additional mass flow from the nozzle and insulation.\n\nPROBLEMS\n\n1. In Figs. 14-4 and 14-16 it can be seen that higher pressures and higher heat\ntransfer rates promote faster ignition. One way to promote more rapid ignition is for\nthe nozzle to remain plugged until a certain minimum pressure has been reached,\nat which time the nozzle plug will be ejected. Analyze the time saving achieved\nby such a device, assuming that the igniter gas evolution follows Eqs. 12\u20145 and\n12-3. Under what circumstances is this an effective method?

Hybrid propulsion has been of considerable interest in the\ncommercial rocket business and in space applications. The main advantages of\nthese propulsion systems are: (1) enhanced safety from explosion or detona-\ntion during fabrication, storage, and operation; (2) start\u2014stop\u2014restart capabilities;\n(3) relative simplicity which may translate into low overall system cost compared\nto liquids; (4) higher specific impulse than solid rocket motors and higher density-\nspecific impulse than liquid bipropellant engines; and (5) the ability to smoothly\nchange thrust over a wide range on demand. Although hybrids have many unique\nfeatures of their own, they do benefit from the developments in liquid and solid\nrockets. Early hybrid motors were produced for target drones and some tactical\nmissiles. Experimental hybrid motors in sizes between 2 and 250,000 Ibf thrust\nhave been developed and ground tested. A few of the large and small hybrid\nmotors have flown in experimental vehicles. However, to date none of the larger\nsystems have been selected for production applications.\n\nAmong the disadvantages of hybrid systems are: (1) mixture ratio and hence\nspecific impulse may vary during steady-state operation (as well as during throt-\ntling); (2) relatively complicated fuel geometries with significant unavoidable fuel\nresidues (slivers) at end of burn, which somewhat reduces the mass fraction and\ncan vary if there is random throttling; (3) prone to large-amplitude, low-frequency\npressure fluctuations (termed chugging); and (4) relatively complicated internal\nmotor ballistics resulting in incomplete descriptions, both of regression rates of\n*This chapter was contributed originally for the 6th edition by Terry A.

While cracks in the solid component may not be as catastrophic as those\nin solid motors, the total surface area does influence the fuel release, and this\narea may change in unpredictable ways during rocket operation in some of the\nmore complicated designs.\n\nThere are presently three distinct configurations of hybrid propulsion systems\n(Ref. 16-1). By far the most common arrangement, termed the classical or typ-\nical configuration, is for the fuel to be in the solid phase and for the oxidizer\nto be stored as a liquid, and many such combinations have been experimentally\nevaluated. The inverse or reverse configuration has the oxidizer as a solid and\nthe fuel is in liquid form. The third one, called the mixed hybrid configuration,\nhas a small amount of solid oxidizer imbedded in the solid fuel, and the fuel-\nrich mixture is then burned with additional oxidizer injected in an afterburner\nchamber, or simultaneously at the head and at the end of the grain cavity. This\nlast configuration results from attempts to enhance the regression rates and thus\ndecrease the chamber volume (Ref. 16-2). Increased regression rates can also\nbe obtained in the classical configuration with metallized fuel added to the grain.\nDesigns with special chambers upstream and downstream of the solid compo-\nnent region are common to most configurations.

The oxidizer can be either a noncryo-\ngenic (storable) liquid or a cryogenic liquid depending on the application and the\nrequired specific impulse. In this hybrid propulsion system concept, the oxidizer\nis injected into a precombustion or vaporization chamber upstream of the primary\nfuel region. The fuel grain cavity contains numerous axial combustion ports that\ngenerate fuel vapor to react with the injected oxidizer. An aftermixing chamber\nis provided to ensure that all fuel and oxidizer are essentially completely burned\nbefore entering the nozzle.\n\n16.1. APPLICATIONS AND PROPELLANTS\n\nHybrid propulsion is well suited to applications or missions requiring throttling,\ncommand shutdown and restart, long-duration missions requiring storable\nnontoxic propellants, or infrastructure operations (manufacturing and launch)\nthat would benefit from a non-self-deflagrating propulsion system. Such\napplications would include primary boost propulsion for space launch vehicles,\nupper stages, and satellite maneuvering systems. Hybrids have been used to\nboost a winged manned space ship.\n\nMany early hybrid rocket motor developments were aimed at target missiles\nand low-cost tactical missile applications (Ref. 16-3). Other development efforts\nfocused on high-energy upper-stage motors. In recent years development efforts\nhave concentrated on booster prototypes for space launch applications. In another\nprogram (Ref. 16-3), a hybrid motor was developed for high-performance upper-\nstage applications with design requirements that included a nominal thrust level\nof 22,240 N and an 8:1 throttling range. Oxygen difluoride was selected as\nthe oxidizer for use with a lithium hydride/polybutadiene fuel grain. Analytical\nand experimental investigations have been made using other high-performance\npropellants. High-energy oxidizers include chlorine/fluorine compounds such as\nCIF3 and ClFs;. Complementary high-energy fuels are typically hydrides of light\nmetals, such as beryllium, lithium, and aluminum, mixed with a suitable poly-\nmeric binder (Ref. 16\u20144). Delivered vacuum-specific impulse levels for these\nhigh-energy hybrid propellants are in the 350- to 380-sec range, depending on\nnozzle expansion ratio. Combustion efficiencies of 95% of theoretical values\nhave been achieved in tests with these propellants; however, none of these exotic\nformulation systems have seen use on flight vehicles.\n\nA more practical, although lower energy, upper-stage hybrid propellant system\nis 90 to 95% hydrogen peroxide oxidizer combined with HTPB fuel. Hydrogen\nperoxide (Ref. 16-5) is considered storable for time periods typical of upper-\nstage mission cycles (oxidizer tanking to mission completion on the order of\nseveral months) and is relatively inexpensive. In solid rocket motors, HTPB is\nused as the binder to consolidate the aluminum fuel and ammonium perchlorate\noxidizer matrix. In a hybrid, HTPB becomes the entire fuel constituent. HTPB\nis low cost, processes easily, and will not self-deflagrate under any conditions.\n",
    "614": "16.1. APPLICATIONS AND PROPELLANTS 597\n\nA common propellant system for large hybrid booster applications is liquid\noxygen (LOX) oxidizer and HTPB fuel. Liquid oxygen is a widely used oxidizer\nin the space launch industry, is relatively safe, and delivers high performance\nat low cost. This hybrid propellant combination produces a nontoxic, relatively\nsmoke-free exhaust. The LOX/HTPB propellant combination favored for booster\napplications is chemically and performance-wise equivalent to a LOX~\u2014kerosene\nbipropellant system. In general, metallized solid fuels are expected to increase\nperformance, but beryllium is very toxic, boron is hard to ignite, lithium has a\nlow heat of combustion, and aluminum oxides increase the molecular mass of the\ncombustion products beyond the temperature gain. Hence the search for hydrides\nand slurries containing these metals to offset their intrinsic disadvantages but this\nfield is still in the research stages. As far as recently considered liquid oxidizers,\nhydrogen peroxide (H202), nitrous oxide (N2O), and HAN (hydroxyl ammonium\nnitrate) have been considered because of their desirable themochemical properties\nand density-specific impulse. Their regression rates and combustion efficiencies\nare comparable to those obtained using LOX, but they have storage advantages\nand comparable degrees of \u201cgreenness.\u201d\n\nWhere a smoky exhaust is not a detriment, hybrid propellants for certain appli-\ncations may benefit from the addition of powdered aluminum to the fuel. This\nincreases the combustion temperature, reduces the stoichiometric mixture ratio,\nand increases fuel density as well as overall density-specific impulse. Although\ndensity-specific impulse (o/s) is increased, addition of aluminum to the fuel\nactually reduces specific impulse. Figure 16\u20142 illustrates theoretical vacuum-\nspecific impulse levels (calculated at 1000 psia chamber pressure and a 10:1\nnozzle expansion ratio) for a variety of cryogenic and storable oxidizers used\nin conjunction with HTPB fuel. Table 16-1 tabulates the heat of formation for\nHTPB reacted with various oxidizers.\n\nA suborbital sounding rocket was successfully launched in 2002 by Lockheed\nMartin using a large-scale hybrid rocket motor. The American Rocket Company\n(AMROC) before its demise tested many hybrid motors from 100 to 250,000 Ibf\nof thrust. In 1998, SpaceDev (Ref. 16\u20146) obtained the technical rights, proprietary\ndata, and patents produced by AMROC. A smaller commercial version of the\nSpace Shuttle has been made by Scaled Composites with a hybrid propulsion\nsystem (developed by SpaceDev) which, in a well-publicized accomplishment,\nwon the Ansari X-Prize when it\u2019s SpaceShipOne (see Fig. 16\u20143) reached space\nin 2004 with two suborbital manned flights. In 1999, a consortium of aerospace\ncompanies also tested several 250,000-lbf thrust LOX/HTPB hybrid prototypes as\na candidate strap-on booster for space launch vehicles (see Ref. 16\u20147). In these\nmotors, polycyclopentadiene (PCPD) is added to the HTPB fuel to increase fuel\ndensity by about 10% over HTPB alone. The motors were designed to operate\nfor 80 sec at a LOX flow rate of 600 Ibm/sec with a maximum chamber pressure\nof 900 psi. Figure 16\u20144 illustrates a cross section of one motor configuration.\nTest results indicated additional work is necessary to develop large hybrid motor\nconfigurations that exhibit stable combustion throughout the motor burn, and in\nunderstanding fuel regression-rate scale-up factors.\n",

    "617": "600 HYBRID PROPELLANT ROCKETS\n\nA hybrid fuel grain is ignited by providing a source of heat, which initiates\ngasification of the solid fuel grain at the head end of the motor. Subsequent\ninitiation of oxidizer flow provides the required flame spreading to fully ignite\nthe motor. Ignition is typically accomplished by injection of a hypergolic fluid\ninto the motor combustion chamber. Using the motor described in Fig. 16-4 as\nan example, a mixture of triethyl aluminum (TEA) and triethyl borane (TEB) is\ninjected into the vaporization chamber. The TEA\u2014TEB mixture ignites sponta-\nneously on contact with air in the combustion chamber, vaporizing fuel in the\ndome region. Subsequent injection of liquid oxygen completes ignition of the\nmotor. TEA\u2014TEB mixtures are currently used for motor ignition in the Atlas\nand Delta commercial launch vehicles. Experimenters (Refs. 16-8 and 16-9)\ndescribe solid fuels that will ignite spontaneously at ambient temperature and\npressure when sprayed with specific oxidizers other than LOX. Small hybrid\nmotors, such as those used in a laboratory environment with gaseous oxygen\noxidizer, are often electrically ignited by passing current through a resistor such\nas steel wool located in the combustion port, or by use of a propane or hydrogen\nignition system.\n16.2. INTERIOR HYBRID MOTOR BALLISTICS\nAs the fuel grain in the classical hybrid configuration contains no oxidizer, com-\nbustion processes occur in the gaseous phase and hence fuel surface regression\nis markedly different from that of a solid rocket motor. Because the solid fuel\nmust vaporize before combustion occurs, fuel surface regression is intrinsically\nrelated to the coupling of combustion port fluid dynamics and the heat transferred\nto the fuel grain surface. The primary combustion region has been shown to be\ncontained within a relatively narrow flame zone located within a boundary layer\nregion that develops and grows over the fuel grain surface (Ref. 16\u201410). Among\nthe mechanisms of heat transfer to the fuel grain surface are convection and\nradiation. Because the hybrid\u2019s field is largely empirical, it should be understood\nthat any motor characteristics will strongly depend on the propellant system and\non the scale and configuration of the combustor chamber being described.\n\nFigure 16\u20145 depicts a simplified model of the hybrid combustion process for\na nonmetallized (or nonradiating) fuel system. Fuel is vaporized as a result of\nheat being transferred from the flame zone to the fuel mass. Vaporized fuel is\nconvected away from the heated surface toward the flame zone while the oxidizer\nfrom the free stream (core flow) is transported to the flame zone by turbulent\ndiffusion. The flame becomes established at a location within the boundary layer\ndetermined by the stoichiometric conditions under which combustion can occur.\nThe thickness of the flame zone is governed primarily by the rate at which the\noxidation reaction occurs. This rate is largely dependent on the pressure and\ntypically follows an exponential dependence on temperature.\n\nFactors affecting the development of the fuel grain boundary layer and, hence,\nfuel regression characteristics include pressure and gas temperature, grain com-\nposition, combustion port oxidizer mass flow rate, and combustion port length\n",

This boundary layer is more complex and more robust than that\nintroduced in Chapter 3 for the supersonic nozzle. Heat transfer relationships\nbetween the gas and the solid phase depend on whether the boundary layer is\nlaminar or turbulent. In a typical hybrid using oxygen, the Reynolds number per\nunit axial length is on the order of 1 to 2 x 10\u00b0 per inch of grain length for\nflux levels between 0.3 and 0.67 lbm/sec/in.\u201d. Thus the properties of turbulent\nboundary layers govern the convective heat transfer (to nonmetallized fuel grains)\nand empirical equations are often utilized. Figure 16-6 summarizes the overall\nbehavior of many oxidizer/solid-fuel combinations. As shown in this figure, there\nare three distinct regimes as a function of increasing mass\u2014flow\u2014velocity in the\nfree stream (G = pv, total or oxidizer mass flow rate). At the low mass flux\nregime, radiative heat transfer phenomena are manifest in the form of pres-\nsure and diameter effects on the optical transmissivity of the propellant gas\n(Ref. 16-12), effects which may also arise from any metal loading present (at the\n\u201cmelting limit\u201d the fuel grain may melt, char, or undergo subsurface decomposi-\ntion; Ref. 16\u201411); the intermediate range represents fully turbulent heat and mass\ntransfer, and the regression rate dependence on G is consistent with the tradi-\ntional convective diffusion results; at the high end results from gas-phase kinetics\non chemical reactions are apparent, and a different type of pressure dependence\nappears (the \u201cflooding limit\u201d results when the flame is extinguished by the high\noxidizer flow rates and depends on the pressure and the chemical reactivity of the\npropellants). Since solid fuel regression rates are a function of many parameters,\nthe reader is encouraged to consult the relevant literature before using any of\nthe correlations included in this chapter. A thorough summary of classical hybrid\nregression rate equations is given in Ref. 16-11, which clearly exemplifies the\ncomplexity of this subject.\n",

(Adapted from\nRef. 16-11.)\n\nIn a nonmetallized fuel grain, at the pressures and flux levels of interest\nfor propulsion applications, heat transfer by convection is thought to be much\nlarger than that transferred by gas-phase radiation or radiation from soot\nparticles in the flow. As a result the basic characteristics of fuel grain regression\nmay be explored via an analysis of convective heat transfer in a turbulent\nboundary layer. Thus, for the intermediate regime of Fig. 16\u20146, the following\nequation may be used for the fuel regression rate, 7:\n\n0.8\n\ni= o.ose2\u2014(#)\"* 023 (16-1)\n\nPp XxX\nwhere G is the free-stream propellant mass velocity (total oxidizer and fuel\nflow per unit area) in a combustion port at any given axial location x, pr is\nthe solid-phase fuel density, j2 is the combustion gas viscosity, and B is a\nnondimensional fuel mass flux reflecting the fuel vaporization and evaluated\nat the fuel surface. All dimensions in Eq. 16-1 need to be in the English\nengineering system of units to match the numerical constant. The parameter 6\nis frequently called the blowing coefficient and can be shown to also represent\na nondimensional enthalpy difference between the fuel surface and flame zone\n(ie., Ah/h, where h, is the heat of gasification). Equation 16-1 indicates that,\nfor nonradiative systems, hybrid fuel regression rates in this regime are strongly\ndependent on G and rather weakly dependent on axial location (x) and fuel\nblowing characteristics (8). It should also be noted that these regression rates\nare not explicitly dependent on chamber pressure. This is not the case for the\nother regimes shown in Fig. 16\u20146 because metallized hybrid fuel systems may\nexhibit a pronounced pressure dependence (see Ref. 16-13).\n\nAs the combustion port length increases, fuel added to the port increases the\ntotal port mass flux. In locations operating at low mixture ratios, the fuel mass\nincrease may be of the same order as the oxidizer mass flow initially entering\n",

Given the weak dependence of regression rate on x in Eq. 16-1, it\nwould be expected that fuel regression would increase along the flow direction\nwith increases of G. While this generally turns out to be the case, fuel regression\nhas been observed to both increase and decrease with increasing x, depending\non the specifics of the motor configuration. In practice, axial fuel regression\ncharacteristics are strongly influenced by the oxidizer injection method and by\nprecombustion/vaporization chamber design characteristics. General trends that\nhave been observed with increasing x are: total mass flux increases, boundary\nlayer thickness growths, flame-standoff distance increases from the surface, com-\nbustion port average gas density increases, and oxidizer concentration decreases.\n\nSince the blowing coefficient 6 is not only an aerodynamic parameter but also\na thermochemical parameter, and since its x dependence is of the same order,\nEq, 16-1 is often simplified for purposes of preliminary engineering design by\nlumping the effects of x, 6, fuel density, and gas viscosity into one parameter,\nusually called a. Moreover, in practice, deviations from the theoretical 0.8 power\nof the mass velocity exponent are often noted. The resulting simplified form of\nEq. 16-1 is therefore written as\n\nr = a(G,)\" (16-2)\nhere G, is the oxidizer mass velocity (i.e., the oxidizer mass flow rate divided\nby the combustion port area).

Recent studies of this region have\nyielded accurate but elaborate empirical fits which are reported in Ref. 16-11.\nIn essence, a radiation heat flux term must be added to the convective heat\nflux arriving at the fuel surface, and this results in modifications to the turbulent\ndiffusion relations applicable here.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND GRAIN CONFIGURATION\n\nA characteristic operating feature of hybrids is that the fuel regression rate is\ntypically less than one-third that of composite solid rocket propellants. It is very\ndifficult to obtain fuel regression rates comparable to propellant burn rates in\nsolid rocket motors. Consequently, practical high-thrust hybrid motor designs\nmust have multiple perforations (combustion ports) in the fuel grain to produce\nthe required fuel surface area. The performance of a hybrid motor (defined in\nterms of delivered specific impulse) depends critically on the degree of flow\nmixing attained in the combustion chamber. High performance stems from high\ncombustion efficiency that is a direct function of the thoroughness with which\nunburned oxidizer exhausting from the combustion port is mixed with unburned\nfuel from within sublayers of the boundary layer. Multiple combustion ports\nserve to promote high combustion efficiency as a result of the turbulent mix-\ning environment for unreacted fuel and oxidizer in the mixing chamber region\ndownstream of the fuel grain.\n\nA cross section of a typical high-thrust hybrid fuel grain is shown in Fig. 16-4.\nThe number of combustion ports required is a motor optimization problem that\nmust account for the desired thrust level, acceptable shifts in mixture ratio during\nburn, motor length and diameter constraints, and desired oxidizer mass veloc-\nity. Hybrid rocket motor design typically begins by specifying a desired thrust\nlevel and a propellant system. Subsequently, selection of the desired operating\noxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratio (O/F ratio) determines the propellant characteristic\nvelocity. Once the characteristic velocity and mixture ratio are specified, the total\npropellant flow rate and the subsequent split between oxidizer and fuel flow rates\nnecessary to produce the required thrust level can be computed. The necessary\nfuel flow rate in a hybrid is determined by the total fuel surface area (perime-\nter and length of the combustion ports) and the fuel regression rate. As will be\nshown in subsequent sections, the fuel regression rate is primarily determined by\nthe oxidizer mass velocity, also called oxidizer flux. The oxidizer flux is equal\nto the mass flow rate of oxidizer in a combustion port divided by the port cross-\nsectional area. Thus the fuel flow rate is intrinsically linked to the oxidizer flow\nrate and cannot be independently specified, as in a liquid rocket engine.\n",
    "622": "16.3. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND GRAIN CONFIGURATION \u2014 605.\nMuch of the technology from liquid and solid propellant rockets is directly\napplicable to hybrid rockets; the main differences lie in the driving mechanisms\nfor solid propellant burning and hybrid fuel regression. In a solid system, the\noxidizer and fuel ingredients are well mixed during the propellant manufacturing\nprocess. Combustion occurs as a result of heterogeneous chemical reactions on\nor very near the surface of the solid propellant. The solid propellant burning\nrate is controlled by chamber pressure and follows the well-established law of\nEq. 12\u20145, with empirical coefficients derived experimentally for specific propel-\nlant formulations. Since the rate of propellant gasification per unit area in a solid\nrocket motor, at a given propellant bulk temperature and in the absence of erosive\nburning, is determined only by chamber pressure, motor thrust is predetermined\nby the initial propellant grain surface area and grain geometrical characteristics.\nIn hybrids with metallized fuel grains, radiation from the metal oxide par-\nticle cloud in the combustion port contribues a major portion of the total heat\nflux to the fuel grain. The local regression rate of the fuel is also quite sensitive\nto the general turbulence level of the combustion port gas flow (Refs. 16-16\nand 16-17). Localized combustion gas eddies or recirculation zones adjacent to\nthe fuel surface act to significantly enhance the regression rate in these areas.\nHybrid fuel regression rate is thought to be insensitive to fuel grain bulk temper-\natures over the range in which solid rocket motors may operate (\u201465 to 165\u00b0F).\nThis is due to the absence of heterogeneous fuel/oxidizer reactions at the fuel\nsurface (in which the reaction rates are temperature dependent) and because, over\nthe above temperature range, the change in heat content of the solid fuel is small\ncompared to the heat necessary to initiate vaporization of the fuel surface.\nSelection of fuel ingredients can also have a significant impact on the grain\nregression rate, which is largely a function of the energy required to convert the\nfuel from solid to vapor phase (h,). This energy is called the heat of gasification\nand, for polymeric fuels, includes the energy required to break polymer chains\n(heat of depolymerization) and the heat required to convert polymer fragments\nto gaseous phase (heat of vaporization). The term \u201cheat of vaporization\u201d is often\nused as a catchall phrase to include all decomposition mechanisms in hybrid\nfuels. In nonmetallized fuels, low heats of gasification tend to produce higher\nregression rates. In metallized fuels, the addition of ultra-fine aluminum (UFAI)\npowder (particle sizes on the order of 0.05 to 0.1 um) to HTPB has been noted to\nsignificantly increase the fuel regression rate relative to a pure HTPB baseline (see\nRef. 16-18 and Fig. 16-7). Hybrid propellants containing aluminum particles\nwith diameters typical of those used in solid rocket propellants (40 to 400 Um)\ndo not exhibit this effect.\nAn alternative form of Eq. 16\u20142, to account for an observed pressure and/or\nport diameter dependency, is given as\ni = aGnp'D, (16-5)\nwhere m and / have been observed to vary between zero and 0.25 and zero and\n0.7, respectively.\n",

(16-7)\nThe difference in fuel regression characteristics between the two motor scales\nillustrates one of the central difficulties of hybrid motor design, that is, that of\nscaling ballistic performance. Scaling issues in hybrid motors are currently not\nwell understood (in part because of the lack of sufficient valid data for different\nmotor sizes) and the literature abounds with empirical regression rate scaling\nrelationships. Computational fluid dynamic approaches to resolving the hybrid\nflow field and calculating fuel surface heating appear to offer the best hope of\nanalytically evaluating scale effects (Ref. 16-19).\nDynamic Behavior\nDynamic behavior in hybrid propulsion systems is important because, as stated\nearlier, the mixture ratio varies even during steady-state flow of the oxidizer.\nWhen mass storage term changes (i.e., the propellant gas that remains to fill the\nincreasing chamber volume as in solid motors, Section 12.1) may be neglected\nin the combustor cavity, then Eqs. 6-2 and 3\u201424 apply, namely,\nA\ntin = ting + tng = PO (16-8)\ny C\nThe steady thrust of a hybrid rocket motor can then be expressed as\nF = ml,go = (ito + mp )Is80 (16-9)\nChanging the thrust or throttling of a hybrid is achieved by changing the\noxidizer flow rate, usually by means of a throttling valve in the oxidizer feed\nline. The fuel flow is a function of the oxidizer flow but not necessarily a linear\nfunction.

For such a situation, if the oxidizer flow\nis reduced to one-half of its rated value, then the fuel flow will be reduced by a\nfactor of 0.707 and the motor thrust, which depends on the total propellant flow\n(ig + Mo), Will not vary linearly with the change in oxidizer flow. Usually, as\nthe thrust is decreased by reducing the oxizider flow, the mixture ratio (1g /ms)\nis reduced, becoming increasingly fuel rich. In some hybrid motor concepts,\na portion of the oxidizer is injected in a mixing chamber downstream of the\nfuel grain in order to maintain a more constant mixture ratio. However, for\nmost applications, the system design can be optimized over the range of mixture\nratios encountered with very little degradation of average specific impulse due\nto throttling.\n\nEquation 16-12 also indicates that, for constant oxidizer flow, fuel production\nwill increase with increasing port radius if n < ; For n > 3, fuel production will\ndecrease with increasing port radius.\n\nFor a fuel grain incorporating N circular combustion ports, Eq. 16-10 can be\nsimply integrated to give combustion port radius, instantaneous fuel flow rate,\ninstantaneous mixture ratio, and total fuel consumed as functions of burn time:\n\nCombustion port radius R as a function of time and oxidizer flow rate:\n\nfin, \\\" 1/Qn+1)\nR(t) = {aan +0(=) aia (16-13)\naN\n\nInstantaneous fuel flow rate:\n\n. n . n (1-2n)/(1+2n)\n.

The total propellant mass required is therefore\n1,181,457 Ibm.\n\nSelection of circular fuel ports is not an efficient way of designing a hybrid grain since\nlarge fuel slivers will remain at the end of burn. In the preceding example, a sliver fraction\n(1 minus fuel consumed divided by fuel loaded) of 29.8% can be calculated. Recognizing\nthat uniform burn distances around each port, as well as between combustion ports and\nthe case wall, will minimize residual fuel sliver, the outer ring of circular ports may be\nreplaced with quadrilateral-shaped ports. Such a grain is illustrated in Fig. 16\u20149b. If, as\nbefore, the grain diameter is constrained to be 150 in., the grain geometry is uniquely\ndetermined by specification of the initial fuel and oxidizer flow rates, number of ports, burn\ntime, and the requirement that the burn distance around each port be equal. Additionally,\nthe hydraulic diameter D,, (four times port area divided by port perimeter) of all ports\nshould be equal to assure that all ports have the same mass flow rate.\n\nFor this example, the nine-port grain configuration results in a theoretical fuel sliver\nfraction of 4.3%. In reality, the sliver fraction for both designs will be somewhat greater\nthan theoretical values since some web must be designed to remain between ports at\nthe end of the burn duration to prevent slivers from being expelled out of the nozzle.\nTable 16-3 compares key features of the circular port grain design (Fig. 16\u20149a) and the\nquadrilateral grain design (Fig. 16-9).\n",

COMBUSTION INSTABILITY 613\n\nThe throat material erosion rate in a hybrid is generally significantly greater than that\nof a solid propellant system and is a strong function of chamber pressure and mixture\nratio. Erosion of carbonaceous throat materials (carbon cloth phenolic, graphite, etc.) is\nprimarily governed by heterogeneous surface chemical reactions involving the reaction\nof carbon with oxidizing species present in the flow of combustion gases such as O2, O,\nH20, OH, and CO? to form CO. Hybrid motor operation at oxygen-rich mixture ratios and\nhigh pressure will result in very high throat erosion rates. Operation at fuel-rich mixture\nratios and pressures below 400 psi will result in very low throat erosion rates.\n\nIn general, the effect of throat erosion in ablative nozzles on overall motor perfor-\nmance depends on initial throat diameter. For the booster design under consideration, a\n0.010-in./sec erosion rate acting only at the throat will reduce the expansion ratio from\n7.72 to 7.11 over the 120-sec burn time.

Therefore, if throat erosion is accounted for, delivered specific impulse at the\nend of burn is 297.0 sec, a reduction of only 0.77% compared with the noneroding throat\nassumption. As initial throat diameter is reduced, the reduction in expansion ratio due to\nthroat erosion becomes greater, thereby resulting in greater performance losses.\n\nCurrent practice for preliminary design of hybrid booster concepts is to couple\na fuel regression rate model, a grain design model, and booster component design\nmodels in an automated preliminary design procedure.

COMBUSTION INSTABILITY\n\nThe hybrid combustion process tends to produce rough pressure versus time\ncharacteristics. However, a well-designed hybrid can typically limit combustion\nroughness to approximately 2 to 3% of mean chamber pressure. In any com-\nbustion device, pressure fluctuations will tend to organize themselves around the\nnatural acoustic frequencies of the combustion chamber or oxidizer feed sys-\ntem. While significant combustion pressure oscillations at chamber natural-mode\nacoustic frequencies have been observed in numerous hybrid motor tests, such\noscillations have not proved to be an insurmountable design problem. When\npressure oscillations have occurred in hybrid motors, they have been observed to\ngrow to a limiting amplitude which is dependent on such factors as oxidizer feed\nsystem and injector characteristics, fuel grain geometric characteristics, mean\nchamber pressure level, and oxidizer mass velocity. Unbounded growth of pres-\nsure oscillations, such as may occur in solid and liquid rocket motors, has not\nbeen observed in hybrid motors.\n\nHybrid motors have exhibited two basic types of instabilities in static test\nenvironments: oxidizer feed system-induced instability (nonacoustic), and flame\nholding instability (acoustic).

Figure 16\u201410a illus-\ntrates feed system induced instability in a 24-in.-diameter hybrid motor operated\nat a LOX flow rate of 20 lbm/sec with HTPB fuel. The instability is mani-\nfested by high-amplitude, periodic oscillations well below the first longitudinal\n(1-L) acoustic mode of the combustor. In this example the oscillation frequency\nis 7.5 Hz whereas the 1-L mode frequency is approximately 60 Hz. Stiffening\nthe feed/injection system can eliminate the oscillation. This is accomplished by\nincreasing the injector pressure drop (thus making propagation of motor pressure\ndisturbances upstream through the feed system more difficult) and eliminat-\ning sources of compressibility in the feed system. Chugging-type instabilities\nin hybrid motors have proven amenable to analysis in terms of prediction and\nprevention (Ref. 16-20). For purposes of comparison, Fig. 16\u201410b shows a\npressure\u2014time trace from the same 24-in.-diameter hybrid motor exhibiting sta-\nble combustion while being operated at a LOX flow rate of 40 Ibm/sec at a\nmaximum chamber pressure of 900 psi.\n\nFlame-holding instability relevant to hybrid motors was first observed dur-\ning the development of solid fuel ramjets (Ref. 16-21). A solid fuel ramjet is\nessentially a hybrid motor operating on the oxygen available in ram air. Flame-\nholding instabilities in hybrids are typically manifested at acoustic frequencies\nand appear in longitudinal modes. No acoustic instabilities in hybrid motors\nhave been observed in higher frequency tangential or radial modes such as in\nsolid rocket motors or liquid engines. Flame-holding instabilities arise due to\ninadequate flame stabilization in the boundary layer (Ref. 16-22) and are not\nassociated with feed system flow perturbations. For example, flame-holding insta-\nbility in an 11-in.-diameter hybrid motor operated with gaseous oxygen (GOX)\noxidizer and HTPB fuel, using an injector producing a conical flow field. In this\ntest, oxygen flow was initiated through the motor at a pressure of 90 psi for 2 sec\nprior to motor ignition. The motor was ignited using a hydrogen torch that con-\ntinued to operate for approximately 1 sec following motor ignition. During the\nfirst second of motor operation, the hydrogen igniter flame stabilizes the motor.\nWhen the igniter flame is extinguished, the motor becomes unstable. In this case\nstable combustion was achieved by changing the flow field within the motor,\nusing an injector producing an axial flow field.

    "639": "CHAPTER 17\nSS\nELECTRIC PROPULSION\n\nChapters | and 2 include information on electric rocket propulsion devices that\nuse electrical energy for heating and/or directly ejecting propellant, utilizing an\nenergy source that is independent of the propellant itself. The purpose of this\nchapter is to provide an introduction to this field. Vector notation is used in\nseveral of the background equations presented.\n\nThe basic subsystems of a typical electric propulsion thruster are: (1) a raw\nenergy source such as solar or nuclear energy with its auxiliaries such as concen-\ntrators, heat conductors, pumps, panels, radiators, and/or controls; (2) conversion\ndevices to transform this energy into electrical form at the proper voltage, fre-\nquency, pulse rate, and current suitable for the electrical propulsion system;\n(3) a propellant system for storing, metering, and delivering the propellant; and\n(4) one or more thrusters to convert the electric energy into kinetic energy of\nthe exhaust. The term thruster is commonly used here, as thrust chamber is in\nliquid propellant rockets.\n\nElectric propulsion is unique in that it includes both thermal and nonthermal\nsystems as classified in Chapter 1. Also, since the energy source is divorced\nfrom the propellant, the choice of propellant is guided by factors much different\nto those in chemical propulsion. In Chapter 3, ideal relations that apply to all\nthermal thrusters are developed which are also relevant to thermal-electric (or\nelectrothermal) systems. Concepts and equations for nonthermal electric systems\nare defined in this chapter. From among the many ideas and designs of elec-\ntric propulsion devices reported to date, one can distinguish the following three\nfundamental types:\n\n1. Electrothermal. Propellant is heated electrically and expanded thermody-\nnamically; that is, the gas is accelerated to supersonic speeds through a\nnozzle, as in the chemical rocket.\n\n622\n",
    "640": "ELECTRIC PROPULSION 623\n\n2. Electrostatic. Acceleration is achieved by the interaction of electrostatic\nfields on non-neutral or charged propellant particles such as atomic ions,\ndroplets, or colloids.\n\n3. Electromagnetic. Acceleration is achieved by the interaction of electric\nand magnetic fields within a plasma. Moderately dense plasmas are high-\ntemperature or nonequilibrium gases, electrically neutral, and reasonably\ngood conductors of electricity.\n\nA general description of these three types was given in Chapter 1, Figs. 1-8\nto 1-10. Figure 17-1 and Tables 2\u20141 and 17-1 show approximate power and\nperformance values for several types of electric propulsion units. Note that the\nthrust levels are small relative to those of chemical and nuclear rockets, but that\nvalues of specific impulse can be substantially higher; this may translate into a\nlonger operational life for satellites whose life is presently propellant limited.\nInherently, electric thrusters give accelerations too low for overcoming the high-\ngravity field of earth launches. They function best in space, which also matches\nthe near-vacuum exhaust pressures required of electrostatic and electromagnetic\nsystems. All flights envisioned with electric propulsion operate in a reduced\ngravity or gravity-free space and, therefore, must be launched from earth by\nchemical rocket systems. Launching from low-gravity bodies such as asteroids,\nhowever, is feasible without any chemical assist.\n\nRecent interest in very small spacecraft has given rise to the specialized field\nof micropropulsion. Here power levels below 500 W and thrusts below 1 mN\nare needed for these spacecraft because the total mass vehicle (mo) is less than\n100 kg. According to Fig. 17-1 only the pulsed-plasma thruster (PPT) would fit\nin this category, but new miniaturized electrothermal and electrostatic thrusters\nare under development (together with some which are purely chemical), based\non advances in micromanufacturing such as MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical\nsystems) and nanotechnologies. But not all the present thruster concepts can\nbe effectively scaled down to meet micropropulsion needs. Conventional gas\ndynamic micronozzles have a much reduced performance because viscous losses\nare inherent in increased surface-to-volume ratios. Magnetic fields are also dif-\nficult to scale down. For all systems, except those with propellant self-feeding\nfeatures, a significant scaling problem is propellant leakage associated with valve\nminiaturization. Also, machining traditional metals to the microscale remains\nchallenging, and nanotechnology fabricated pieces that use glasses or silicon are\nquite porous to gaseous propellants often exceeding acceptable leakage rates,\n(Ref. 17-1).\n\nThe many advantages of electric propulsion had been offset by their required\nuse of substantial quantities of electricity which, at certain power levels, had been\nan expensive commodity in space until recently. All types of electric propulsion\npresently depend on a vehicle-borne power source\u2014based on solar, chemi-\ncal, or nuclear energy\u2014and power conversion and conditioning equipment. The\nmass of the electric generating equipment, even when solar energy is employed,\ncan become much larger than that of the thrusters, particularly when thruster\nefficiency is low. This causes appreciable increases in inert-vehicle mass (or dry\n",

Typically these satellites can share their electrical power sources,\nthus avoiding the penalty to the propulsion system. What remains to be tagged to\nthe propulsion system is the power-conditioning equipment, except in instances\nwhere it is also shared with other spacecraft components.\n\nElectric propulsion has been considered for space applications since the incep-\ntion of the space program in the 1950s but has only begun to make widespread\nimpact since the mid-1990s. This is a result of the availability of sufficiently large\namounts of electrical power in spacecraft. References 17\u20142 to 17\u20144 are devoted\nto electric propulsion.

Pulsed devices differ from\ncontinuous or steady state in that startup and shutdown transients may degrade\ntheir effective performance. Pulsed devices, however, are of practical importance,\nas is detailed later in this chapter.\n\nThe applications for electric propulsion fall into several broad mission cate-\ngories (these have already been introduced in Chapter 4):\n\n1.

A number of new missions look at electric propulsion for either precision\nattitude/position control or formation-flying relative position control.\n\nAs an illustration of the benefit in applying electric propulsion, consider a\ntypical geosynchronous communications satellite with a 15-year lifetime and with\na mass of 2600 kg. For NSSK the satellite might need an annual velocity increase\nof some 50 m/sec; this requires about 750 kg of chemical propellant for the entire\nperiod, which is more than one-quarter of the satellite mass. Using an electric\npropulsion system can increase the specific impulse to 2800 sec (about nines\ntimes higher than a chemical rocket), and the propellant mass can be reduced to\nperhaps less than 100 kg. A power supply and electric thrusters would have to be\nadded, but the inert mass of the chemical system can be deleted. Such an electric\nsystem would save perhaps 450 kg or about 18% of the satellite mass. At launch\ncosts of $10,000 per kilogram delivered to GEO, this is a potential saving of\nsome $4,500,000 per satellite. Alternatively, more propellant could be stored in\nthe satellite, thus extending its useful life. Additional savings could materialize\nif electric propulsion were also used for orbit raising.\n\nThe propulsive output or kinetic power of the jet P; results from the energy\nrate supplied by the available power source, principally diminished by (1) losses\nin the power conversion, such as from solar or nuclear into electrical energy;\n(2) conversions into forms of electric energy (voltage, frequency, etc.) suitable\nfor the thrusters; and (3) losses of the conversion of the electric energy delivered\nto the thruster into propulsive jet energy (7;). The kinetic power (P;) per unit\nthrust (F') may be expressed by the following relation (assuming no significant\npressure thrust or exit flow divergence):\n\nP; sm? 1 1 fi 1\nFw 2 = 3804 (7-1)\n",

It is usually concluded here that thrusters with substantially\nhigh values of J; will require more power and therefore bigger power supplies,\nbut this is not necessarily so. It is shown in this chapter that systems with high\nspecific impulse optimize at much longer propulsive times (t,) and thus at smaller\nthrust levels so that the power requirements may actually decrease.\n\nThruster efficiency n; is defined as the ratio of the thrust producing (axial com-\nponent) kinetic power of the exhaust beam to the total electrical power applied\nto the thruster, including any used in evaporating and/or ionizing the propellant:\n\npower of the jet zm?\nerm FETT (17-2)\nelectrical power input =) (UV)\nThen, from the fundamentals in Chapter 2 (Eqs. 2-19 and 2\u201422)\nf = calle (17-3)\nPe ods\nwith P, representing the electric power input to the thruster in watts and given by\nthe product of the electrical current and all associated voltages (hence the summa-\ntion, )\", sign).

Then\n\nMo = My + Mpi + Mpp (17-4)\n\nThe energy source input to the power supply (i.e., solar or nuclear) has to be\nlarger than its electrical power output; they are related by the power conversion\nefficiency (about 10 to 15% for photovoltaic and up to 30% for rotating machin-\nery) for converting the raw energy into electrical power at the desired voltages,\nfrequencies, and power levels. The converted electrical output P, is then sup-\nplied to the propulsion system. The ratio of the electrical power P, to the mass\nof the power plant mpp is defined as a, which is often referred to as the specific\npower (or its inverse the specific mass) of the power plant or of the entire propul-\nsion system.

The above approach may be compared to the Hohmann method in Example 4-2.\n17.2. ELECTROTHERMAL THRUSTERS\nIn this category, electric energy is used to heat the propellant, which is then\nthermodynamically expanded through a nozzle. There are two basic types in use\ntoday:\n\n1. The resistojet, in which components with high electrical resistance dissipate\npower and in turn heat the propellant, largely by convection.\n\n2. The arcjet, in which current flows through the bulk of the propellant gas\nwhich has been ionized in an electrical discharge. Being relatively devoid\nof material limitations, this method introduces more heat directly into the\ngas (it can reach local temperatures of 20,000 K or more). The electrother-\nmal arcjet is a unit where magnetic fields (either external or self-induced\nby the current) are not as essential for producing thrust as is the noz-\nzle. As shown in Section 17.3 (and Fig. 17\u20149), arcjets can also operate\nas electromagnetic thrusters, but here the magnetic fields are essential for\nacceleration and propellant densities are much lower. Thus, there are some\narc\u2014thruster configurations that could be classified as both electrothermal\nand electromagnetic.\n\nResistojets\nThese devices are the simplest type of electrical thruster because the technology is\nbased on conventional conduction, convection, and radiation heat exchange. The\npropellant is heated by flowing over an ohmically heated refractory-metal surface,\nsuch as (1) coils of heated wire, (2) through heated hollow tubes, (3) over heated\nknife blades, and (4) over heated cyclinders. Power requirements range between\n1 W and several kilowatts; a broad range of terminal voltages, AC or DC, can\nbe designed for, and there are no special requirements for power conditioning.\nThrust can be steady or intermittent as programmed in the propellant flow.\nMaterial limitations presently cap the operating temperatures to under 2700 K,\nyielding maximum specific impulses of about 300 sec. The highest specific\nimpulse has been achieved with hydrogen (because of its lowest molecular mass),\nbut its low density causes propellant storage to be bulky (cryogenic storage being\nunrealistic for space missions).

The gas flow in the heating chamber is\ntypically considered to be either laminar or vortex flow, and the heat transfer to\nthe stream is by convection.\n\nAvailable materials limit the maximum gas temperature of a resistojet. High-\ntemperature materials used for the resistance element include rhenium and refrac-\ntory metals and their alloys (e.g., tungsten, tantalum, molybdenum), platinum\n(stabilized with yttrium and zirconia), as well as cermets. For high-temperature\nelectrical (but not thermal) insulation, boron nitride has been used effectively.\n\nA design objective is to keep heat losses in the chamber at a low level relative\nto the power consumed. This can be done by (1) the use of external insulation,\n(2) internally located radiation shields, and (3) entrant flow layers or cascades.\nWithin reason, the mass of insulation and radiation shields should be small com-\npared to that of the thruster and of the total propulsion system.\n\nThe choice of chamber pressure is influenced by several factors. High pressures\nreduce molecular gas dissociation losses in the chamber, increase the rate of\nrecombination in the exhaust nozzle, improve the heat exchanger performance,\nand reduce the size of both the chamber and the nozzle for a given mass flow\nrate. However, high pressures cause higher heat transfer losses, higher stresses\non the chamber walls, and can accelerate the rate of nozzle throat erosion. The\nlifetime of a resistojet is often dictated by the nozzle throat life. Good design\npractice, admittedly a compromise, sets the chamber pressure in the range of 15\nto 200 psia.\n\nThruster efficiencies of resistojets range between 65 and 85%, depending on\nthe propellant and the exhaust gas temperature, among other things. The specific\nimpulse delivered by any given electrothermal design depends primarily on (1)\nthe molecular mass of the propellant and (2) the maximum temperature that the\nchamber and the nozzle surfaces can tolerate.\n",

The highest specific power\n(power over mass flow rate) is achieved at relatively low flow rates, low thrusts,\nand modest heater augmentation. At the higher temperatures the dissociation of\nmolecular gases noticeably reduces the energy that is available for thermodynamic\nexpansion.\n\nEven with its comparatively lower value of specific impulse, the resistojet\u2019s\nsuperior efficiency contributes to far higher values of thrust/power than any of\nits (see Eq. 17-3) competitors. Additionally, these engines possess the lowest\noverall system empty mass since they do not require a power processor and their\nplumes are uncharged (thus avoiding the additional equipment that ion engines\nrequire).

The arc stretches between the tip of a central\ncathode and an anode, which is part of the coaxial nozzle that accelerates the\nheated propellant. These electrodes must be electrically insulated from each other\nand be able to withstand high temperatures. At the nozzle it is desirable for the\narc to attach itself as an annulus in the divergent portion just downstream of the\nthroat (see Figs. 1-8 and 17-5 for location). The region of attachment is known\nto move around depending on the magnitude of the arc voltage and on the mass\nflow rate.

The flow structure at the nozzle throat is quite\nnonuniform and arc instabilities and erosion at the throat are life limiting. The\nmixing of cooler outer gas with the arc-heated inner gas tends to stabilize the\narc while lowering its conductivity, which in turn requires higher voltages of\noperation. In some designs the arc is made longer by lengthening the throat.\n\nThe analysis of arcjets is based on plasma physics, as it applies to a moving\nionized fluid. The conduction of electricity through a gas requires that a certain\nlevel of ionization be present. This ionization must be obtained from an electrical\ndischarge, that is, the breakdown of the cold propellant resembling a lightning\ndischarge in the atmosphere (but, unlike lightning, a power supply may feed\nthe current in a continuous or pulsed fashion). Gaseous conductors of electricity\nfollow a modified version of Ohm\u2019s law.

We can now rewrite the basic Ohm\u2019s law as simply\nj =oE. The scalar electrical conductivity is directly proportional to the density\nof unattached or free electrons that, under equilibrium, may be found from Saha\u2019s\nequation (Ref. 17-8). Strictly speaking, Saha\u2019s equation applies to thermal ion-\nization only (and not necessarily to electrical discharges). For most gases, either\nhigh temperatures or low ionization energies or both are required for plentiful\nionization.

The cathode,\ntypically a coaxial pointed rod, is located in the plenum region.\n\n3. The nozzle inner walls are heated by the arc, which may be at a temperature\nof 10,000 to 20,000 K. Typically the nozzle is cooled only by conduction\nand the heat transfer is reduced by the boundary layers.\n\n4. The hot gas in the arc proper must mix quickly with the rest of the pro-\npellant; this is done by vortexing and turbulence.\n\n5. Portions of the anode are heated to extreme temperatures in a section of\nthe divergent nozzle at the arc footpoint (the arc attachment region of the\nelectrode). The heating of the propellant is not all contained in the plenum\nchamber, and heating of a supersonic flow is a source of losses.\n\nTo start an arcjet, a much higher voltage than necessary for operation has to be\napplied momentarily in order to break down the cold gas. Some arcjets require an\nextended initial burn-in period before stable consistent running ensues. Because\nthe conduction of electricity through a gas is inherently unstable, arcs require an\nexternal ballast resistance to allow steady-state operation. The cathode must run\nhot and is usually made of tungsten with 1 or 2% thorium (suitable up to about\n3000 K). Boron nitride, an easily shaped high-temperature electrical insulator, is\ncommonly used.\n\nPresently, most arcjets are rather inefficient since less than half of the electrical\nenergy goes into kinetic energy of the jet; the nonkinetic part of the exhaust\nplume (residual internal energy and ionization) is the largest loss.

Generally, arcjets exhibit about six times the thrust-\nto-power ratio of a resistojet because of their increased specific impulse coupled\nwith relatively low values of efficiency. Arcjets have another disadvantage in\nthat the required power processing units are somewhat more complex than those\nfor resistojets, due to the complexity of arc phenomena.\n\nThe life of an arcjet can be severely limited by local electrode erosion and\nvaporization, which is specifically due to action of the arc attachment point and\nof the high operating temperatures in general.

NONTHERMAL ELECTRICAL THRUSTERS\nThe acceleration of a hot propellant through the use of a supersonic nozzle is the\nmost conspicuous feature of thermal thrusting. Now we turn our study to acceler-\nation of a propellant by electrical forces where no area changes are essential for\ndirect gas acceleration. The electrostatic (or Coulomb) force and the electromag-\nnetic (or Lorentz) force can be used to accelerate a suitable propellant to speeds\nultimately limited by the speed of light (note that thermal thrusting is essentially\nlimited by the speed of sound in the plenum chamber). The microscopic vector\nforce f, on a singly charged particle can be written as\n\nfo =eE+evuexB (17-13)\nwhere e is the electron charge magnitude, EF the electric field vector, ve the\nvelocity of the charged particle, and B the magnetic field vector. The sum of the\nelectromagnetic forces on all the charges gives the total force per unit volume\nvector F, (scalar forms of this equation follow):\n\nF. =p.E+jxB (17-14)\nHere p\u00a2 is the net charge density andj the electric current vector density. With\nplasmas, which by definition have an equal mixture of positively and negatively\ncharged particles within a volume of interest, this net charge density vanishes. On\nthe other hand, the current due to an electric field does not vanish because positive\nions move opposite to electrons, thus adding to the current (but in plasmas with\nfree electrons this ion current can be very small). From Eq. 17-14, we see that an\nelectrostatic accelerator must have a nonzero net charge density that is commonly\nreferred to as a space\u2014charge density. An example of an electrostatic accelerator\nis the ion engine, which operates with positive ions; here magnetic fields are\nunimportant in the accelerator region. Electromagnetic accelerators operate only\nwith plasmas and rely solely on the Lorentz force to accelerate the propellant.\nThe Hall accelerator may be thought of as a crosslink between an ion engine and\nan electromagnetic engine. These three types of accelerator are discussed next.\nResearch and development efforts in the field of nonthermal thrusters have been\nextensive and truly international.\n\nElectrostatic and electromagnetic devices require an understanding of the\nbasic laws of electricity and magnetism which are most elegantly summarized in\nMaxwell\u2019s equations complemented by the force relation and Ohm\u2019s law, both\npreviously introduced. Moreover, various processes in ionization and gaseous\nconduction need to be considered. This subject forms the basis of the discipline\nof magnetohydrodynamics or MHD; however, a proper treatment of this subject\nis beyond the scope of this book.\n",

They can operate only in a near vacuum.\nThe electric force depends only on the charge, and all charged particles must be\nof the same \u201csign\u201d if they are to move in the same direction. Electrons are easy\nto produce and are readily accelerated, but they are so extremely light in mass as\nto be impractical for electric propulsion. From thermal propulsion fundamentals\none might deduce that \u201cthe lighter the exhaust particle the better.\u201d However, the\nmomentum carried by electrons is relatively negligible even at velocities near\nthe speed of light. Thus, the thrust per unit area that can be imparted to such\nan electron flow remains negligible even when the effective exhaust velocity or\nspecific impulse gets to be very high. Accordingly, electrostatic thrusters use\ncharged heavy-molecular-mass atoms as positive ions (a proton is 1840 times\nheavier than the electron and a typical ion of interest contains hundreds of pro-\ntons). There has been some research work with small liquid droplets or charged\ncolloid which can in turn be some 10,000 times heavier than atomic particles. In\nterms of power sources and transmission equipment, the use of the heavier parti-\ncles contributes to more desirable characteristics for electrostatic thrusters\u2014for\nexample, high voltages and low currents in contrast to low voltages and high\ncurrents with their associated massive wiring and switching.\n\nElectrostatic thrusters can be further categorized by the source of charged\n\nparticles. Exit beam neutralization is required for all these schemes.\n\n1. Electron bombardment thrusters. Positive ions in a gas are produced by\nbombarding a gas or vapor, such as xenon or mercury, with electrons\nusually emitted from a heated cathode. Ionization can be either DC or RF.\nIn these ion engines, acceleration is accomplished with a separate electrical\nsource applied through a series of suitably manufactured and positioned\nelectrically conducting grids (see Fig. 1-9). This is presently the most\ncommon method.\n\n2. Field emission thrusters. In the field emission electric propulsion (FEEP)\nconcept, positive ions are obtained from a liquid metal source flowing\nthrough a capillary tube and several geometrical arrangements are possible\n(Ref. 17-12). Liquid metals such as indium (Ref. 17-13) or cesium when\nsubjected to a high electric field (> 10\u00b0 V/cm) may produce molecular ions\nflowing into the accelerating region. The injector, ionizer, and accelerator\nare part of the same voltage circuit which operates typically at values over\n10 kV.

In its simplest form, a plasma\nconductor carries a current in the direction of an applied electric field but\nperpendicular to a magnetic field, with both of these vectors in turn normal to\nthe direction of plasma acceleration. Equation 17-12 can be specialized to a\nCartesian coordinate system where the plasma\u2019s \u201cmass-mean velocity\u201d is in the\nx direction, the external electric field is in the y direction, and the magnetic field\nacts in the z direction. A simple manipulation of Eq. 17\u201412, with negligible\nHall parameter f, yields a scalar equation for the current, noting that only jy, Ey,\nand B, are present:\njy = o(Ey \u2014 vy B;) (17-26)\n\nand the Lorentz force becomes\n\nFy, = jyB, = 0 (Ey ~ vyB,)B, = 0B? (Ey/B, ~ vs) (17-27)\nHere F, represents the force \u201cdensity\u201d within the accelerator and should not be\nconfused with F the thrust force; F, has units of force per unit volume (e.g.,\nN/m\u00b0). The axial velocity v, is a mass-mean velocity that increases internally\nalong the accelerator length; the thrust equals the exit value (Umax or v2) multi-\nplied by the mass flow rate. It is noteworthy that, as long as Ey and B, (or E/B)\nremain constant, both the current and the force decrease along the accelerator\nlength due to the induced field v,B, which subtracts from the impressed value\nE,. This increase in plasma velocity translates into a diminishing force along\nsuch Faraday accelerators, which limits the final axial velocity. Although not\npractical it would seem desirable to design for increasing E/B along the channel\nin order to maintain a substantial accelerating force throughout. But it is not\nnecessarily of interest to design for peak exit velocity because this might trans-\nlate into unrealistic accelerator lengths (see Problem 8). It can be shown that\npractical considerations would restrict the exit velocity to below one-tenth of the\nmaximum value of Ey /B;.\n\nA \u201cgas-dynamic approximation\u201d (essentially an extension of the classical con-\ncepts of Chapter 3 to plasmas in an electromagnetic field) by Resler and Sears\n(Ref. 17-17) indicates that further complications are possible, namely, that a con-\nstant area accelerator channel would choke if the plasma velocity does not have\nthe very specific value of [(k \u2014 1)/k](E/B) at the sonic location of the acceler-\nator. This plasma tunnel velocity would have to be equal to 40% of the value of\nE/B for inert gases, since k (the ratio of specific heats) equals 1.67. Thus constant\narea, constant E/B accelerators could be severely constrained because Mach 1\ncorresponds only to about 1000 m/sec in typical inert gas plasmas. Constant-area\nchoking in real systems, where the properties E, B, and o are actually quite\nvariable, is likely to manifest itself as one or more instabilities. Another problem\nis that values of the conductivity and electric field are usually difficult to deter-\nmine and a combination of analysis and measurement is required to evaluate, for\nexample, Eq. 17-12. Fortunately, most plasmas are reasonably good conductors\nwhen less than 10% of the particles are ionized.\n",

The concept illustrates the basic physical interactions but suffers\nfrom loss of propellant, resulting in low efficiency.\n\nFigure 17-8 shows the simplest plasma accelerator which employs a self-\ninduced magnetic field. This is the pulsed plasma thruster (PPT) where an\naccelerating plasma burst or \u201cbit,\u201d initiated by a spark between the accelerator\nelectrodes, is powered by a capacitor which in turn is charged from the spacecraft\npower supply. The current flow through the plasma quickly discharges the capac-\nitor and hence the mass flow rate pulse must be synchronized to a \u201cdischarge\nschedule.\u201d The discharge current closes a \u201ccurrent loop,\u201d one which induces\na significant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the rails. Analogous\nto a metal conductor in an electric motor, the Lorentz force acts on the mov-\nable plasma segment, accelerating it along the rails. Hence no area changes are\nnecessary to accelerate the propellant but some designs do incorporate nozzles.\n\nAs indicated in Fig. 17-8, the system (though containing a plasma along\nwith other more ordinary resistances) may be modeled with an equivalent L-R-C\npulsed circuit where L is the lumped-parameter total circuit inductance, R is the\ntotal Ohmic resistance, and C is an effective capacitance. It is undesirable to let\nthe current reverse during the pulsing as this diminishes the overall thrust, and\na nonoscillatory pulse may be realized through the R > 2,/L/C impedance bal-\nancing criterion (when this is not physically possible, a \u201cquenching diode\u201d may\nbe inserted, Ref. 17-18). In some designs, the hot plasma pulse has significant\ngas-dynamic expansion capabilities that may contribute to the thrust (with a noz-\nzle for thermal expansion). In many typical configurations, the rate of increase\nof the circuit inductance with the distance the arc travels (x) is the sole propul-\nsive contributor (F = 31\u00b0(dL/dx) where / is the current in the loop); since the\ninduced magnetic field is a function of the accelerator\u2019s geometry, the axial thrust\nrealized may be written for a given configuration as\nLinear : F= hol ?(s/w) (17-28)\n\nCoaxial : F= (4) Hol?

Even though\nelectron densities are on the order of 10! to 10!7/m3, the effective space\u2014charge\ndensities (p,) are considerably lower because of positive ion neutralization and\nthey approach zero at the exit.

In the analysis of\nSection 17.1, for any desired Au/v,, one can find an optimum v/v, given a\npayload ratio; however, even when the choice of an electric propulsion system\nhas been made, thrust time f, is unspecified and thus the total mass also remains\nunspecified. Thrust time or \u201cburn time\u201d is the smallest for zero payload and\ncontinuously increases with increasing payload ratio. Concurrently, the specific\nimpulse changes, making the problem underconstrained.\nGiven the payload mass and the vehicle velocity increment, a spacecraft design\nprocedure could be followed using the optimum results of Section 17.1, for\nexample:\n1.

Check that the available vehicle electrical power (from Eq. 17-6), vehicle\n\nvolume, and the desirable mission time and total cost are not exceeded.\n\nAs may be evident, a unique criterion for the choice of the assumed payload\nmass fraction is missing above. One possible solution to this problem is to look\nfor a \u201cdual optimum,\u201d namely, to seek the shortest burn time consistent with the\nhighest payload mass fraction of the flight vehicle. A maximum for the product\nof mpi/mo with Au/v, does exist as a function of v/v.

Table 17\u20147 gives estimated values of a along with the\ncorresponding range of specific impulse and the efficiency for electric propulsion\nsystems in present engine inventories.\n\nThe optimum formulation in Section 17.1, however, needs to be modified to\naccount for the portion of tankage mass which results from propellant loading;\nwith few exceptions, an additional 10% of the propellant mass shows up as\ntank or container mass (this could be further refined to include reserve propel-\nlant). Reference 17\u201423 includes information on this tankage fraction for various\nthrusters.

    "677": "660 ELECTRIC PROPULSION\n\nThe success of this approach hinges on the validity of the engine information\nemployed. In particular, the specific power should represent all the inert com-\nponents of the propulsion system, which can be reasonably assumed to depend\non the power level. The payload mass must reflect all mass that is neither pro-\nportional to the electrical power nor propellant related. The tankage fraction\nallowance must reflect the total propellant mass and thus the use of Eq. 17-38\nis necessary. It is assumed that there is available a source of electricity (typi-\ncally from 28 to 300 VDC for solar-powered craft) which is not tagged to the\npropulsion system. The analysis also assumes that the efficiency is not a function\nof specific impulse (in contrast to Ref. 17\u201425); this implies that an average or\neffective value can be used. Since each individual engine type spans a somewhat\nlimited range of specific impulse, this assumption is not deemed to be too restric-\ntive. For the continuous thrust schedules required by electric propulsion systems,\nthrust time is equal to mission time.\n\nExample 17-4. For the three electric propulsion systems listed below (from Table 17-7)\nand for a proposed mission that would carry a 100-kg payload through a change of velocity\nof 7000 m/sec, find the thrust times that fall within the dual-optimum region shown in\nFig. 17-12.

The thrust duration (f,) is the only quantity needed to place each electric\npropulsion system within the identified dual-optimum region in Fig. 17-12 since all other\nparameters are now fixed. Lower and upper bounds for the thrust time need to be found\nwhich by construction include results that are within 10% of the peak performance. Once\nty is found, the payload fraction may be inferred along with its associated thrust and\npower levels.\n\nFrom the given data, the ratio Au/(/,;go) for each thruster may be calculated which\nis independent of v-.

The longer propulsive times associated with these dual-optimum\ncalculations yield P, values which actually decrease and which result in the smallest range\nfor the MPD thruster [1.75 kW (236 days) to 5.97 kW (105 days)] when compared to the\nHall electrical propulsion system [3.83 kW (56.6 days) to 14.7 kW (22.1 days)], where\nthe \u00a2, values are shown above in parentheses. Resulting amounts for optimal thrust F and\ntotal mass mg can also be shown to decrease with increasing specific impulse.\n\n17.5. MISSION APPLICATIONS\n\nThree principal application areas have been described in the introduction to this\nchapter. The selection of a particular electric propulsion system for a given flight\napplication depends not only on the characteristics of the propulsion system\n(which are described in this chapter) but also on the propulsive requirements of\nthe particular flight mission, the proven performance of the specific candidate\npropulsion system, along with vehicle interfaces and the power conversion and\nstorage systems. In general, the following criteria can be enumerated:\n\n1. For very precise low-thrust station-keeping and attitude control applica-\ntions, pulsed thrusters are generally best suited. Some systems, however,\nmust have continuous thrust because pulsing generates noise that cannot\nbe tolenated.\n\n2. For deep-space missions where the vehicle velocity increment is\nappreciably high, systems with very high specific impulse will give better\n",
    "679": "662 ELECTRIC PROPULSION\nperformance. As shown in Section 17.1, the optimum specific impulse is\nproportional to the square root of the thrust operating time.\n\n3. While very high spacecraft velocity increments optimize at the higher spe-\ncific impulses, the propulsive times also increase, making the optimum\nthrust and corresponding power generally lower. This is favorable to elec-\ntrostatic and electromagnetic units that operate in the specific impulse range\nabove 1000 sec. See Example 17-4.\n\n4. Since most missions of interest require long life, system reliability is a\nkey selection criterion. Extensive testing under all likely environmental\nconditions (temperatures, pressures, accelerations, vibration, and radiation\nconditions) is required for high reliability. Ground testing and qualifica-\ntion of electric engines should be as thorough as that of their chemical\ncounterparts, where large resources have made it possible to develop the\npresent inventory of reliable engines. Simulation of the low pressures in\nspace requires large vacuum test chambers.\n\n5. There is a premium on high thruster efficiency and high power-conversion\nefficiency. This will reduce the inert mass of the power supply system and\nreduce thermal control requirements, all of which usually results in lower\ntotal mass and higher vehicle performance. Technology advances in specific\npower (a) and decreases in tankage fraction (g) are also desirable toward\nminimizing inert mass.\n\n6. For every propulsion mission there is a theoretically optimum range of\nspecific impulse (see Fig. 17-3) and thus an optimum electrical propulsion\nsystem design. While this optimum may be blurred by some conflicting\nsystem constraints (e.g., flight time or maximum power or size constraints\nor cost), the present variety in the electrical propulsion systems inventory\ncan meet most goals.\n\n7. The present state of the art in electrical power sources appears to limit\nthe type and size of electric propulsion systems that can be integrated,\nparticularly for missions to the outer planets, unless nuclear energy power\ngeneration on board the spacecraft becomes more developed and acceptable.\n\n8. Practical factors, such as the storing and feeding of liquids in zero gravity,\nthe availability of propellant (in the case of xenon), the conditioning of\npower to the desired voltage, frequency, and pulse duration, as well as the\nredundancy in key system elements, the survival of sensors or controllers\nin long flights, and the inclusion of automatic self-checking devices along\nwith cost, will all influence the selection and application of specific types\nof electric rockets.\n\n9. In addition to tankage considerations, propellant selection will also be\ninfluenced by certain interface criteria such as plume noninterference with\ncommunication signals. Plumes must also be thermally benign and noncon-\ndensing on sensitive surfaces of the spacecraft such as optical windows,\nmirrors, and solar cells.\n",

Power output capacity of operational systems has been increas-\ning from the low one-kilowatt range to the medium tens of kilowatts required\nfor some missions. The high end of a hundred or more kilowatts is still pending\nsome technological (and political) breakthroughs.\n\nSpace power level requirements have been increasing with the increased capac-\nity of earth-orbit communications satellites and with planned missions, manned\nand robotic, to the moon and nearby planets. Payload requirements and thrust\nduration dictate the power level. Commercial communications satellites can tem-\nporarily reduce the communications volume during orbit maintenance so that\nthe electric power does not require a dedicated power supply for the propulsion\nsystem, but larger power demands require enhanced solar cell capabilities. Some\ncommunications satellites actually share part or all of the power-conditioning\nequipment with their electric thrusters.\n\nPower Generation Units\n\nElectric power generation units are classified as either direct (no moving mechan-\nical parts) or dynamic. When the primary driver is reliability and the total power\nis small, direct conversion has been preferred but, with the advent of the Space\nShuttle and with the manned International Space Station (ISS), dynamic systems\nare being reconsidered. Many diverse concepts have been evaluated for meeting\nthe electrical power demands of spacecraft, including electric propulsion needs.\nDirect energy conversion methods considered include photovoltaic, thermoelec-\ntric, thermionic, and electrochemical, while indirect methods (with moving parts)\ninclude the Brayton, Rankine, and Stirling cycles.\n\nBatteries. Batteries can basically be classified as either primary or secondary.\nPrimary batteries consume their active materials and convert chemical energy\ninto electrical. Secondary batteries store electricity by utilizing a reversible chem-\nical reaction and are designed to be recharged many times. There are both dry-cell\nand wet-cell primary batteries. The importance of primary batteries passed with\nthe short-lived satellites of the early 1960s. Secondary batteries with recharging\nprovisions provide electrical power at output levels and lifetimes longer than\nprimary batteries. Batteries must be sealed against the space vacuum or housed\ninside pressurized compartments. Secondary batteries are a critical component of\nsolar cell systems for power augmentation and emergency backup and the periods\nwhen the satellite is in the earth\u2019s shadow.\n\nFuel Cells. Chemical fuel cells are conversion devices used to supply space-\npower needs for 2 to 4 weeks and for power levels up to 40 kW in manned\nmissions.

Solar cells rely on the photovoltaic effect to convert the\nelectromagnetic radiation to electricity. In silicon cells, sunlight generates a volt-\nage and a photocurrent across a p-n junction running as an inverse photodiode.\nPresent devices have reached a 15 to 20% efficiency range, but single-bandgap\n(i.e., single-junction) semiconductors suffer from a theoretical upper limit of\n31%. Multijunction solar cells can circumvent this efficiency limit because each\nlayer can absorb a separate part of the spectrum as the light passes though the\nstack; presently arrays with greater than 21% efficiencies are being launched with\nmultijunction semiconductors. Another aspect of typical solar cell arrays is that\nmany had been originally designed for only a 28 VDC output, although the newer\ndesigns such as those for the ISS bus operate at 160 VDC and the NSTAR/DAWN\nmissions uses 80 to 160 VDC. Today, there are designs (termed high-voltage or\ndirect drives, Ref. 17-27) that produce increased output voltages of the solar cell\narrays, up to 300 VDC and beyond. These higher output voltages, when oper-\national, will considerably simplify the power-conditioning equipment in many\nexisting electric-propulsion systems resulting in valuable inert mass savings. But\ncare must be taken to avoid electrostatic discharges that occur more easily in some\nearth orbits. Solar cells supplied electrical power for most of the long-duration\nspace missions. The first solar cell was launched in March 1958 on Vanguard\nI and successfully energized data transmission for 6 years. Solar arrays exist in\nsizes up to 10 kW and could potentially grow to 10 MW sizes in earth orbits.\n\nTypically, solar cell arrays are designed for 20% overcapacity to allow for\nmaterial degradation toward the end of life. Loss in performance is due to radi-\nation and particle impact damage, particularly in the radiation belts around the\nearth. There has been some improvement in efficiency, reliability, and power\nper unit mass. For example, standard silicon cells deliver 180 W/m? and arrays\nhave 40 W/kg. Newer gallium arsenide cells produce 220 W/m? and are more\nradiation resistant than silicon cells; gallium arsenide cells are presently space\nqualified and integrated; together with parabolic concentrators, their arrays can\nreach 100 W/kg (Ref. 17-23).\n\nFactors that affect the specific mass of a solar array, besides conversion effi-\nciency, include the solar constant (which varies inversely as the square of the dis-\ntance from the sun) and the manufactured thinness of the cell. Orientation to the\nsun is a more critical factor when solar concentrators are being used. Cell output is\na function of cell temperature; performance can suffer as much as 20% for a 100\u00b0F\nincrease in operating temperature so that thermal control is critical. Solar cell pan-\nels can be (1) fixed and body mounted to the spacecraft, (2) rigid and deployable\n(protected during launch and positioned in space), (3) flexible panels that are\ndeployed (rolled out or unfolded), and (4) deployed with concentrator assist.\n\nIn addition to the solar arrays, their structure, deployment, and orientation\nequipment, other items including batteries, plus power-conditioning and distribu-\ntion systems are assigned to the power source. Despite their apparent bulkiness\n",

Nuclear energy from\nlong-decay radioisotopes and from fission reactors has played a role in the pro-\nduction of electricity in space. Both thermoelectric (based on the Seebeck effect)\nand thermionic (based on the Edison effect) devices have been investigated. These\ngenerators have no moving parts and can be made of materials reasonably resis-\ntant to the radioactive environment. But their specific power is relatively low and\ncost, availability, and efficiency have been marginal.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s nuclear fission reactors were regarded as\nthe most promising way to meet the high power demands of space missions,\nparticularly trips to the outer planets involving months and perhaps years of\ntravel. Radioisotope thermoelectric power has been embodied in a series of SNAP\n(Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) electrical generating units which were\ndesigned and tested, ranging from 50 W to 300 kW of electrical output. Fission\nreactors were included in the SPAR (Space Power Advance Reactor) program,\nlater renamed SP-100, which was to feature a nuclear-thermoelectric generator\nwith an electrical output of 100 kW; this program was discontinued in 1994.\nMore recent space nuclear reactor programs include NASA\u2019s Project Prometheus\nand the Russian TOPAZ that has been space tested up to nearly 6 kW. The latter\nconsists of sets of nuclear rods each surrounded by a thermionic generator.\n\nThermionic converters have a significant mass advantage over thermoelectric\n\nones, based on their higher effective radiator temperatures. Since thermal effi-\nciencies for both thermoelectric and thermionic conversion are below 10% and\nsince all unconverted heat must be radiated, at higher temperatures thermionic\nradiators are less massive. Moreover, cooling must be present at times when no\nelectricity is generated since the heat source cannot be \u201cturned off.\u201d Depending\non the location of the waste heat, clever designs are needed, involving heat pipes\nor recirculating cooling fluids.\nLong-Duration High-Output Dynamic Systems. Designs of electric power\ngeneration with outputs of 10 to 1000 kW here on earth have been based on\nStirling or Rankine heat engine cycles with nuclear, chemical, and even solar\npower sources. Overall efficiencies can be between 10 and 40%, but the hard-\nware is complex, including bearings, pumps, reactors, control rods, shielding,\ncompressors, turbines, valves, and heat exchangers. Superconducting magnets\ntogether with advances in the state-of-the-art of seals, bearings, and flywheel\nenergy storage have made some dynamic units relatively more attractive. There\nremain development issues about high-temperature materials that will withstand\nintense nuclear radiation fluxes over several years; there are still some con-\ncerns about achieving the required reliability in such complex systems in the\nspace environment. While limited small-scale experiments have been conducted,\nthe development of these systems remains a challenge. An advanced Stirling\nradioisotope generator is under development to replace radioisotope thermoelec-\ntric generators (RTGs) in some NASA missions.\n",
    "684": "PROBLEMS 667\nPower-Conditioning Equipment\nPower-conditioning equipment is a necessary part of electric propulsion systems\nbecause of inevitable mismatches in voltage, frequency, power rate, and other\nelectrical properties between the space-power generating unit and the electric\nthruster. In some earlier systems, the power-conditioning equipment was more\nexpensive, more massive, and more difficult to qualify than the thruster itself. If\nthe thrust is pulsed, as in the PPT, the power-conditioning unit has to provide\npulse-forming networks for momentary high currents, exact timing of different\noutputs, and control and recharging of condensers. Electrostatic engines typi-\ncally require from 1000 to 10,000 VDC; the output of solar-cell arrays is 28\nto 300 VDC so there is a need for DC-to-DC inverters and stepup transformers\nto accomplish the task. Often this equipment is housed in a single \u201cblack box,\u201d\ntermed the power conditioner. Modern conditioning equipment contains all the\ninternal logic required to start, safely operate, and stop the thruster; it is con-\ntrolled by on\u2014off commands sent by the spacecraft control processor. Besides the\nabove functions that are specific to each engine, power-conditioning equipment\nmay provide circuit protection and propellant flow control as well as necessary\nredundancies.\n\nAs may be apparent from Table 17-7, one of the largest contributors to\nthe specific mass of the system (a) is the power-conditioning equipment. Here,\nelectrothermal units have the simplest and lightest conditioning equipment. Ion\nengines, on the other hand, have the heaviest equipment, with Hall thrusters\nsomewhere in between (Ref. 17\u201420). PPTs tend to be massive, but advances in\nenergy storage capacitors can improve this situation. In fact, advances in solid-\nstate electronic pulse circuits together with lighter, more efficient, and higher\ntemperature power-conditioning hardware are areas of great interest in electric\npropulsion. The efficiency of the equipment tends to be high, about 90% or more,\nbut the heat generated is at a low temperature and must be removed to maintain\nthe required moderately low temperatures of operation. When feasible, the elim-\nination of conditioning equipment is desirable, the so-called direct drive, but a\nlow-pass filter would still be necessary for electromagnetic interference (EMI)\ncontrol (more information in Ref. 17-25).\n\nPROBLEMS\n\n1.

    "690": "CHAPTER 18\nSS\nTHRUST VECTOR CONTROL\n\nControlling the flight path and the attitude of a rocket-propelled vehicle makes it\npossible to reach a precise flight destination. Rocket propulsion systems always\nprovide a \u201cpush\u201d toward an intended target, but they also can be made to provide\ntorques to rotate the vehicle in conjunction with the propulsive force. By con-\ntrolling the direction of the thrust vectors through mechanisms described in this\nchapter, it is possible to influence a vehicle\u2019s pitch, yaw, and roll rotary motions.\nIntegrated thrust vector control units are only effective while the principal propul-\nsion system is operating and producing an exhaust jet. For periods of free flight,\nwhen the main rocket is off, a separate propulsion mechanism is needed for\nachieving control over attitude or flight path. In space (see Figs. 4-13 and 8-13),\nmany vehicles utilize dedicated attitude-control systems with multiple thrusters\nin addition to their thrust-producing main propulsion system. Examples of other\ndedicated attitude control arrangements are shown in Figs. 3-17, 6-13, 12-27,\nand 12-28. A relevant history of flight trajectory control in liquid propellant\nrocket engines is given in Ref. 18-1.\n\nAll chemical propulsion systems can be provided with one of several types\nof thrust vector control (TVC) mechanisms. Some of these apply either to solid,\nhybrid, or to liquid propellant rocket propulsion systems, but most are specific\nto only one of these propulsion categories. We will describe two types of thrust\nvector control concept: (1) for an engine or a motor with a single nozzle and\n(2) for those that have two or more nozzles.\n\nAerodynamic fins (fixed and movable) continue to be very effective for con-\ntrolling vehicle flight within the earth\u2019s atmosphere, and almost all weather\nrockets, anti-aircraft missiles, and air-to-surface missiles use them. Even though\naerodynamic control surfaces provide some additional drag, their effectiveness\nin terms of vehicle weight, turning moment, and actuating power consumption is\n\n673\n",
    "691": "674 THRUST VECTOR CONTROL\n\ndifficult to surpass with any other flight control method. Vehicle flight control can\nalso be achieved by a separate attitude control propulsion system as described in\nSections 4.5. and 6.7. Here six or more small liquid propellant thrusters (with a\nseparate feed system and a separate control) provide small moments to the vehi-\ncle in flight during, before, or after the operation of the main rocket propulsion\nsystem.\n\nThe reasons for TVC are: (1) to willfully change a flight path or trajectory\n(e.g., changing the direction of the flight path of a target-seeking missile); (2) to\nrotate the vehicle or change its attitude during powered flight; (3) to correct for\ndeviation from the intended trajectory or the attitude during powered flight; or\n(4) to correct for thrust misalignment of a fixed nozzle in the main propulsion\nsystem during its operation, when the main thrust vector misses the vehicle\u2019s\ncenter of mass. In all prior analyses, we have implicitly assumed that the trust\nvector passes through the center of mass and is perfectly aligned with the direction\nof flight (see Fig. 4-5). In TVC, moments are purposely generated about the\ncenter of mass to control flight trajectories. The location of the side force (or its\nperpendicular component) along the vehicle\u2019s axis determines its moment arm\nand thus the magnitude of the force needed for a given application; this implies\nthat locations as far away as possible from the center of mass (i.e., with long\nmoment arms) are the most desirable to minimize the force action and thus the\npropellant usage.\n\nPitch moments are those that raise or lower the nose of a vehicle; yaw moments\nturn the nose sideways; and roll moments are applied about the main axis of the\nflying vehicle (Fig. 18\u20141). Usually, the thrust vector of the main rocket nozzle\nis in the direction of the vehicle axis and goes through the vehicle\u2019s center of\nmass. Thus it is possible to obtain pitch and yaw control moments by the simple\ndeflection of the main rocket thrust vector; however, roll control usually requires\nthe use of two or more rotary vanes or two or more separately hinged propulsion\nsystem nozzles. Figure 18\u20142 explains the pitch moment obtained by a hinged\nthrust chamber or nozzle. The side force and the pitch moment vary as the sine\nof the effective angle of thrust vector deflection.\n\n+Pitch\n-Yaw\n+Yaw\n+Roll\n\u2014Pitch\nFIGURE 18-1.

The pitch moment applied to the vehicle is FL sind.\n18.1. TVC MECHANISMS WITH A SINGLE NOZZLE\nMany different mechanisms have been used successfully. Several are illustrated\nin Refs. 18-2 and 18-3. They can be classified into four categories:\n\n1. Mechanical deflection of the nozzle or thrust chamber.\n\n2. Insertion of heat-resistant movable bodies into the exhaust jet; these expe-\nrience aerodynamic forces and cause a deflection of a part of the exhaust\ngas flow.\n\n3. Injection of fluid into the side of the diverging nozzle section, causing an\nasymmetrical distortion of the supersonic exhaust flow.\n\n4. Separate thrust-producing devices that are not part of the main propulsion\nsystem providing flow through the nozzle.\n\nEach category is described briefly below and in Table 18-1, where the four\ncategories are separated by horizontal lines. Figure 18\u20143 illustrates several TVC\nmechanisms. All of the TVC schemes shown here have been used in production\nvehicles.\n\nIn the hinge or gimbal scheme (a hinge permits rotation about one axis only,\nwhereas a gimbal is essentially a universal joint), the whole engine is pivoted on\na bearing and thus the thrust vector is rotated. For small angles this scheme has\nnegligible losses in specific impulse and is used in many vehicles. It requires a\nflexible set of propellant piping (bellows) to allow the propellant to flow from\nthe tanks of the vehicle to the movable engine. The Space Shuttle (Fig. 1-14)\nhas two gimballed orbit maneuver engines, and three gimballed main engines.\nFigures 6\u20141, 6\u20147, and 8\u201417 show gimballed engines. Some Soviet launch vehi-\ncles use multiple thrusters and hinges (Fig. 11\u20141 shows four hinges), while many\nU.S. vehicles use gimbals.\n\nJet vanes are pairs of heat-resistant, aerodynamic wing-shaped surfaces sub-\nmerged in the exhaust jet of a fixed rocket nozzle.

Graphite jet vanes were used in the\nGerman V-2 missile in World War II and in the Scud missiles fired by Iraq in\n1991. The advantage of having roll control with a single nozzle often outweighs\nthe performance penalties. A recent application is discussed in Ref. 18-4.\n\nSmall auxiliary thrust chambers were used in the Thor and early version\nof Atlas missiles. They provide roll control while the principal rocket engine\noperates. They are fed from the same feed system as the main rocket engine.\nThis scheme is still used on some Russian booster rocket vehicles.\n\nThe injection of secondary fluid through the wall of the nozzle into the main\ngas stream has the effect of forming oblique shocks in the nozzle diverging\nsection, thus causing an unsymmetrical distribution of the main gas flow, which\nproduces a side force. The secondary fluid can be stored liquid or gas from a\nseparate hot gas generator (the gas would then still be sufficiently cool to be\npiped), a direct bleed from the chamber, or the injection of a catalyzed monopro-\npellant. When the deflections are small, this is a low-loss scheme, but for large\nmoments (large side forces) the amount of secondary fluid becomes excessive.\nThis scheme has found application in a few large solid propellant rockets, such\nas Titan IIIC and one version of Minuteman.\n\nOf all the mechanical deflection types, the movable nozzles and the gimballed\nengine are the most efficient. They do not significantly reduce the thrust or the\nspecific impulse and are weight-competitive with the other mechanical types.\nThe flexible nozzle, shown in Figs. 18\u20143 and 18-4, is a common type of TVC\nused with solid propellant motors. The molded, multilayer bearing pack acts\nas a seal, a load transfer bearing, and a viscoelastic flexure. It uses the defor-\nmation of a stacked set of doubly curved elastomeric (rubbery) layers between\nspherical metal sheets to carry the loads and allow an angular deflection of the\nnozzle axis. The flexible seal nozzle has been used in launch vehicles and large\nstrategic missiles, where the environmental temperature extremes are modest. At\nlow temperature the elastomer becomes stiff and the actuation torques increase\nsubstantially, requiring a much larger actuation system. Figure 18\u20145 describes a\ndifferent type of flexible nozzle. It uses a movable joint with a toroidal hydraulic\nbag to transfer loads. There are double seals to prevent leaks of hot gas and\nvarious insulators to keep the structure below 200\u00b0F or 93\u00b0C.\n\nTwo of the gimbals will now be described in more detail. Figure 18\u20146 shows\nthe gimbal bearing assembly of the Space Shuttle main engine. It supports the\nweight of the engine and transmits the thrust force. It is a ball-and-socket univer-\nsal joint with contact and intermeshing spherical (concave and convex) surfaces.\nSliding occurs on these surfaces as the gimbal assembly is rotated. When assem-\nbling the engine to the vehicle, some offset bushings are used to align the thrust\nvector. Some of the design features and performance requirements of this gim-\nbal are listed in Table 18-2. The maximum angular motion is actually larger\nthan the deflection angle during operation so as to allow for various tolerances\nand alignments.

(Used with permission\nfrom Ref. 18-2.)\nangular speeds, and accelerations during operation are usually much smaller than\nthe maximum values listed in the table.\n\nIn Table 18\u20141 a scheme is shown which is suitable only for a liquid propellant\nrocket engine operating on a gas generator cycle. The exhaust gas from the turbine\nis fed into one or more nozzles and the maximum torque is limited by the amount\nof the hot gas. The Russian RD-119 upper-stage engine used six hot gas valves\nto control the flow of turbine exhaust gas to four pitch and yaw fixed nozzles and\nfour smaller roll control fixed nozzles. Clearly visible in Fig. 6-10, the RS-68\nengine shown has only one continuously flowing nozzle for the turbine exhaust,\nwithout a valve, which augments the thrust.

Its thrust loss is high when tabs are rotated at full angle\ninto the jet, but is zero when the tabs are in their neutral position outside of the\njet. On most flights the time-averaged position of the tab is a very small angle\nand the average thrust loss is small. Jet tabs can form a very compact mechanism\nand have been used successfully on tactical missiles using solid propellant rocket\nmotors.

The thrust loss is\nroughly proportional to the vector angle. This mechanism is shown in Fig. 18-3\nand mentioned in Table 18-1.\n\nThe concept of TVC by secondary fluid injection into the exhaust stream dates\nback to 1949 and can be credited to A. E. Wetherbee, Jr. (U.S. Patent 2,943,821).\nApplication of liquid injection thrust vector control (LITVC) to production vehi-\ncles began in the early 1960s. Both inert (water) and reactive fluids (such as\nhydrazine or nitrogen tetroxide) have been used. Although side injection of reac-\ntive liquids is still used on some of the older vehicles, it requires a pressurized\npropellant tank and a feed system. A high-density injection liquid is preferred\nbecause its tank will be relatively small and its pressurization will require less\nmass. Because other schemes have better preformance, liquid injection TVC will\nprobably not be selected for new applications.\n\nHot gas injection (HGITVC) of solid rocket propellant or liquid propellant\ncombustion products is inherently attractive from a performance and packaging\nviewpoint. In the past there has not been a production application of HGITVC\n",

However, two factors now\nmake hot-gas-side injection feasible: First, hot gas valves can be made with the\nnewer carbon-carbon structural parts and modern insulators. A hot gas system\nwith a limited duration hot gas carbon valve is described in Ref. 18-6. Also,\nadvances in metallurgy have made possible the development of hot valves made\nof rhenium alloy, a high-temperature metal suitable for hot gas valve applications.\nThe second factor is the development of solid propellants that are less aggres-\nsive (less AP, Al,O3, and/or fewer oxidizing gas ingredients) and reduce the\nerosion in nozzles and valves; this helps the hot gas valves and insulated hot gas\nplumbing to better survive for limited durations but often at the expense of propul-\nsion system performance. Experimental hot gas systems have had difficulties\nwith thermal distortions and in keeping key components cool enough to prevent\nfailure.\n\nWith either liquid or solid propellants, the hot gas can be bled off the main\ncombustion chamber or generated in a separate gas generator. The hot gas valves\ncan be used to (1) control side injection of hot gas into a large nozzle, or (2) con-\ntrol a pulsing flow through a series of small fixed nozzles similar to small attitude\ncontrol thrusters described in Chapters 4, 6, and 12. In liquid propellant engines\nit is feasible to tap or withdraw gas from the thrust chamber at a location where\nthere is an intentional fuel-rich mixture ratio; the gas temperature would then be\nlow enough (about 1100\u00b0C or 2000\u00b0F) so that uncooled metal hardware can be\nused for HGITVC valves and piping.\n\nThe total side force resulting from secondary injection of a fluid into the\nmain stream of the supersonic nozzle can be expressed as two force components:\n(1) the force associated with the momentum of the injectant and (2) the pressure\nunbalance acting over areas of the internal nozzle wall. The second term results\nfrom the unbalanced wall pressures within the nozzle caused by shock formation,\nboundary layer separation, difference between injectant and undisturbed nozzle\nstream pressures, and primary-secondary combustion reactions (for chemically\nactive injectants). The strength of the shock pattern and the pressure unbalance\ncreated between opposite walls in the nozzle is dependent on many variables,\nincluding the properties of the injectant and whether it is liquid or gas. In the case\nof injecting a reactive fluid, the combustion occurring downstream of the injection\nport(s) usually produces a larger pressure unbalance effect than is obtained by\nliquid vaporization only. However, benefit from combustion is dependent on a\nchemical reaction rate high enough to keep the reaction zone close to the injection\nport. The TVC performance that is typical of inert and reactive liquids and hot\ngas (solid propellant combustion products) is indicated in Fig. 18-8. This plot\nof force ratios to mass flow ratios is a parametric representation commonly used\nin performance comparisons.\n",

TVC WITH MULTIPLE THRUST CHAMBERS OR NOZZLES\nAll the various concepts shown in Fig. 18\u20143 can provide pitch and yaw moments\nto a vehicle. Roll control can be obtained only if there are at least two separate\nvectorable nozzles, four fixed pulsing or throttled flow nozzles, or two jet vanes\nsubmerged in the exhaust gas from a single nozzle.\n\nSeveral concepts have been developed and flown that use two or more rocket\nengines or a single engine or motor with two or more actuated nozzles. Two fully\ngimballed thrust chambers or motor nozzles can provide roll control with very\nslight differential angular deflections. For pitch and yaw control, the deflection\nwould be larger, be of the same angle and direction for both nozzles, and the\ndeflection magnitude would be the same for both nozzles. This can also be\nachieved with four hinged (see Fig. 11-1) or gimballed nozzles. Figure 18-9\nshows the rocket motor of an early version of the Minuteman missile booster\n(first stage) with four movable nozzles.

    "704": "18.4. INTEGRATION WITH VEHICLE 687\n18.3. TESTING\nTesting of thrust vector control systems often includes actuation of the system\nwhen assembled on the propulsion system and the vehicle. For example, the\nSpace Shuttle main engine can be put through some gimbal motions (without\nrocket firing) prior to a flight. A typical acceptance test series of the TVC system\n(prior to the delivery to an engine manufacturer) may include the determination\nof input power, accuracy of deflected positions, angular speeds or accelerations,\nsignal response characteristics, or validation of overtravel stops. The ability to\noperate under extreme thermal environment, operation under various vehicle or\npropulsion system generated vibrations, temperature cycling, and ignition shock\n(high momentary acceleration) would probably be a part of the qualification tests.\n\nSide forces and roll torques are usually relatively small compared to the main\nthrust and the pitch or yaw torques. Their accurate static test measurement can be\ndifficult, particularly at low vector angles. Elaborate, multicomponent test stands\nemploying multiple load cells and isolation flextures are needed to assure valid\nmeasurements.\n\n18.4. INTEGRATION WITH VEHICLE\n\nThe actuations or movements of the TVC system are directed by the vehicle\u2019s\nguidance and control system (see Ref. 18\u20147). This system measures the three-\ndimensional position, velocity vectors, and rotational rates of the vehicle and\ncompares them with the desired position, velocity, and rates. The error signals\nbetween these two sets of parameters are transformed by computers in TVC\ncontrollers into control commands for actuating the TVC system until the error\nsignals are reduced to zero. The vehicle\u2019s computer control system determines\nthe timing of the actuation, the direction, and magnitude of the deflection. With\nservomechanisms, power supplies, monitoring/failure detection devices, actuators\nwith their controllers, and kinetic compensation, the systems tend to become\ncomplex.\n\nThe criteria governing the selection and design of a TVC system stem from\nvehicle needs and include the steering-force moments, force rates of change, flight\naccelerations, duration, performance losses, dimensional and weight limitations,\navailable vehicle power, reliability, delivery schedules, and cost. For the TVC\ndesigner these translate into such factors as duty cycle, deflection angle, angle\nslew rate, power requirement, kinematic position errors, and many vehicle-TVC\nand motor\u2014TVC interface details, besides the program aspects of costs and deliv-\nery schedules.\n\nInterface details include electrical connections to and from the vehicle flight\ncontroller, the power supply, mechanical attachment with fasteners for actua-\ntors, and sensors to measure the position of the thrust axis or the actuators.\nDesign features to facilitate the testing of the TVC system, easy access for\ncheckout or repair, or to facilitate resistance to a high-vibration environment\n",

The designs of these compo-\n\nnents must be coordinated and integrated. Nozzle-TVC interfaces are discussed\nin Refs. 6\u20141 (TVC of liquid rocket engines and their control architecture) and\n\n18-7.\n\nThe actuators can be hydraulic, pneumatic, or electromechemical (lead screw),\nand usually include a position sensor to allow feedback to the controller. The\nproven power supplies include high-pressure cold stored gas, batteries, warm gas\nfrom a gas generator, hydraulic fluid pressurized by cold gas or a warm gas\ngenerator, electric or hydraulic power from the vehicle\u2019s power supply, and elec-\ntric or hydraulic power from a separate turbogenerator (in turn driven by a gas\ngenerator). The last type is used for relatively long-duration high-power applica-\ntions, such as the power package used in the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster\nTVC, explained in Ref. 18\u20148. The selection of the actuation scheme and its power\nsupply depends on the minimum weight, minimum performance loss, simple con-\ntrols, ruggedness, reliability, ease of integration, linearity between actuating force\nand vehicle moments, cost, and other factors. The required frequency response is\nhigher if the vehicle is small, such as with small tactical missiles. The response\nlisted in Table 18-3 is more typical of larger spacecraft applications. Sometimes\nthe TVC system is integrated with a movable aerodynamic fin system, as shown\nin Ref. 18\u20149. The control aspects of electromechemical actuators are discussed\nin Ref. 18-10.\n\nPROBLEMS\n\nWhen solving problems in thrust vector control, information regarding the center of mass\n\nof the vehicle and either the centroidal radius of gyration or the appropriate mass moment\n\nof inertia should be deducible from the geometry of the rocket vehicle or should be given\nexplicitly. Many elementary books in dynamics carry useful tables in this regard (see, for\nexample, J. L. Meriam and L. G. Kraige, Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics, 6th edition,\n\nJohn Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, 2006). Note that in most propulsion systems,\n\nthe center of mass moves during operation along the vehicle axis as the propellant is\n\nconsumed.\n\n1.

The subject of engineer-\ning design has advanced considerably in recent times and computer-aided design\nis now common. System engineering is now used routinely. See Ref. 19-1.\nOther works address the design of space systems (e.g., Refs. 19-1 to 19-3) and\nthe design of liquid propellant engines (e.g., Ref. 19-4). Section 11.6, \u201cSystem\nIntegration and Engine Optimization,\u201d and Section 15.4, \u201cRocket Motor Design\nApproach,\u201d are preludes to this chapter and have in part some duplicate content.\n\nSystem engineering is a useful tool in making a rocket engine selection. It\ncan be defined in several ways. One way (adapted from Ref. 19\u20145) is \u201ca logical\nprocess of activities, analyses and engineering designs, that transforms a set of\nrequirements arising from specific mission objectives in an optimum way. It\nensures that all the likely aspect of a project or engineering system have been\nconsidered and integrated into a consistent whole.\u201d It comprises all the elements\nof a propulsion system and its ground support, all interfaces with other vehicle\nsubsystems or ground-based equipment, considers safety aspects, risks, costs,\nsystem and component analyses, and the orderly selection of the most suitable\npropulsion system. System engineering can also be useful in other applications\n(such as ship building, flight vehicles, or test facilities) each with its own set of\nmissions.\n\nThere are usually three levels of requirements from which propulsion systems\ncan be derived. (Ref. 19-5). At every level there are some activities, studies, or\ntrade-off evaluations.\n\n1. The top level are the requirements defining the mission, such as a space\ncommunication system or a missile defense system. The analysis and opti-\nmization are usually done by the organization responsible for the mission.\nThey define parameters like trajectories or orbits, payloads, number of vehi-\ncles, life, and the like and record them in a document, often called mission\nrequirements specification.\n\n2. From the mission requirements documents the definition and requirement\nof the flight vehicle are derived. It could include ambient temperature lim-\nits, vehicle size, vehicle mass, number and sizes of vehicle stages, type\nof propulsion, required mass fraction, minimum specific impulse, need for\nthrust vector control and/or attitude control, allowable accelerations, accept-\nable propellants, restraints on engine size or inert mass, cost restraints,\nallowable start delay, desired thrust-time profile, preferred propulsion sys-\ntem type (liquid, solid, electrical), and so forth. The analysis, studies,\nengineering, and preliminary design and requirements specification are usu-\nally done by the organization responsible for the flight vehicle.\n\n3. The propulsion requirements are the basis for the design and development\nof the propulsion system, and they are derived from the above two sets of\nrequirements.

See Section 19.3.\n\nMuch of the design (three-dimensional model of the propulsion system), most\nof the analyses (such as stress analysis), the testing, the keeping track of all\nhardware assemblies and parts, and the inspection records or NC programming are\ndone today by a computer using different available or newly developed computer\nprograms.

If cost criteria have\nthe highest priority, then the engine will be different from the one that has\nperformance as its top priority. For a given mission, one of these criteria is\nusually more important than the other two. There is a strong interdependence\nbetween the three levels of requirements and the three categories of criteria\nmentioned above. Some of the characteristics of the propulsion system (which\nis usually a second-tier subsystem) can have a strong influence on the vehicle\nand vice versa.

The selection is based on a series of criteria,\nwhich are based on the requirements and which will be used to evaluate and com-\npare alternate propulsion systems. This process for determining the most suitable\nrocket propulsion system depends on the application, the ability to express many\nof the characteristics of the propulsion systems quantitatively, the amount of\napplicable data that are available, the experience of those responsible for mak-\ning the selection, and the available time and resources to examine the alternate\npropulsion systems. What is described here is one somewhat idealized selection\nprocess as depicted in Fig. 19-1, but there are alternate sequences and other\nways to do this job.\n\nSince the total vehicle\u2019s performance, flight control, operation, or maintenance\nare usually critically dependent on the performance, control, operation, or main-\ntenance of the rocket propulsion system (and vice versa), the process will usually\n",

This iterative process involves both the\nsystem organization (or the vehicle/system contractor) and one or more propul-\nsion organizations (or rocket propulsion contractors). Documentation can take\nmany forms; electronic computers have expanded their capability to network,\nrecord, and retrieve documents.\n\nA number of competing candidate systems are usually evaluated. They may\nbe proposed by different rocket propulsion organizations, perhaps on the basis of\nmodifications of some existing rocket propulsion system, or may include some\nnovel technology, or may be new types of systems specifically configured to fit the\nvehicle or mission needs. In making these evaluations it will be necessary to com-\npare several candidate propulsion systems with each other and to rank-order them\n(in accordance with the selection criteria) on how well they meet each require-\nment. This requires analysis of each candidate system and also, often, some addi-\ntional testing. For example, statistical analyses of the functions, failure modes, and\nsafety factors of all key components can lead to quantitative reliability estimates.\nFor some criteria, such as safety or prior related experience, it may not be possible\nto compare candidate systems quantitatively but only somewhat subjectively.\n",
    "712": "19.1. SELECTION PROCESS 695\n\nVarious rocket parameters for a particular mission need to be optimized. Trade-\noff studies are used often to optimize certain parameters in accordance with\nthe requirements. Trade-off studies have been performed on the following items\nand they helped in making the decisions on the best parameters of the propul-\nsion system: number of trust chambers, optimum chamber pressure (considers\nperformance and inert propulsion system mass), selected mixture ratio (perfor-\nmance, tank volume), solid propellant case configuration (L/D), the cost versus\npropulsion system performance, chamber pressure versus size and/or mass of\npropulsion system, chamber pressure versus heat transfer or cooling method,\nalternate grain configurations, minimizing travel of center of mass during oper-\nation, thrust magnitude/profile versus powered flight duration, nozzle exit area\nratio versus performance, nozzle mass, or nozzle dimensions (L,D), alternate\nTVC concepts versus mass and power, chamber pressure versus heat transfer\n(cooling method or insulation) and inert mass. See Ref. 19-5.\n\nEarly in the selection process a tentative recommendation is usually made as\nto whether the propulsion system should be a solid propellant motor, a liquid\npropellant engine, an electrical propulsion system, or some other type. Each type\nhas its own regime of thrust, specific impulse, thrust-to-weight ratio (acceler-\nation), or likely duration, as shown in Table 2\u20141 and Fig. 2-1; these factors\nare listed for several chemical rocket engines and several types of nonchemical\nengines. Liquid engines and solid motors are covered in Chapters 6 to 15, hybrids\nin Chapter 16, and electric propulsion in Chapter 17.\n\nIf an existing vehicle is to be upgraded or modified, its propulsion system\nis usually also improved or modified (e.g., higher thrust, more total impulse, or\nfaster thrust vector control). While there might still be some trade-off studies and\noptimization of the propulsion parameters that can be modified, one normally\ndoes not consider an entirely different propulsion system as is often done in an\nentirely new vehicle or mission. Also, it is rare that an identical rocket propulsion\nsystem is selected for two different applications; usually, some design changes,\ninterface modifications, and requalification are usually necessary to adapt an\nexisting rocket propulsion system to another application. Proven existing and\nqualified propulsion systems, that fit the desired requirements, usually have an\nadvantage in cost and reliability.\n\nElectric propulsion systems have a set of unique applications with low thrusts,\nlow accelerations, trajectories in space, high specific impulse, long operating\ntimes, and generally a relatively massive power supply system. They perform\nwell in certain space transfer and orbit maintenance missions. With more elec-\ntric propulsion systems flying than ever before, the choice of proven electric\npropulsion thruster types is becoming larger. These systems, together with design\napproaches, are described in Chapter 17 and Ref. 19-3.\n\nWhen a chemical rocket is deemed most suitable for a particular application,\nthe selection has to be made between a liquid propellant engine, a solid propel-\nlant motor, or a hybrid propulsion system. Some of the major advantages and\ndisadvantages of liquid propellant engines and solid propellant motors are given\nin Tables 19-1 to 19\u20144. These lists are general in nature; some items can be\n",

Solid Propellant Rocket Motor Advantages\n\nSimple design (few or no moving parts).\n\nEasy to operate (little preflight checkout).\n\nReady to operate quickly.\n\nWill not leak, spill, or slosh.\n\nSometimes less overall weight for low total impulse application.\n\nCan be throttled or stopped and restarted (usually only once) if preprogrammed and predesigned\n\nCan provide TVC, but at increased complexity.\n\nCan be stored for 10 to 30 years.\n\nUsually, higher overall density; allows more compact package, smaller vehicle\n(less drag).\n\nSome propellants have nontoxic, clean exhaust gases, but often at a performance penalty.\n\nThrust termination devices permit control over total impulse.\n\nAblation and gasification of insulator, nozzle, and liner materials contribute to mass flow and\nthus to total impulse.\n\nCan avoid detonation when a tactical motor is subjected to energetic stimulant\n(e.g., bullet impact or external five.) by judicious design and special propellant.\n\nSome tactical missile motors have been produced in large quantities (over 200,000 per year).\n\nCan be designed for recovery, refurbishing, and reuse (Space Shuttle solid rocket motor).\n\nTABLE 19-2. Liquid Propellant Rocket Engine Advantages\n\nThe highest specific impulse, can be attained with certain liquid propellants. This increases the\nvehicle velocity increment and the attainable mission velocity.\n\nCan be randomly throttled and randomly stopped and restarted; can be efficiently pulsed (some\nsmall thrust sizes over 250,000 times). Thrust\u2014time profile can be randomly controlled; this\nallows a reproducible flight trajectory.\n\nCutoff impulse can be controllable with thrust termination device (better control of vehicle\nterminal velocity).\n\nCan be largely checked out just prior to operation. Can be tested at full thrust on ground or\nlaunch pad prior to flight.\n\nCan be designed for reuse after field services and checkout.\n\nThrust chamber (or some part of the vehicle) can be cooled by propellant and made lightweight.\n\nStorable liquid propellants have been kept in vehicle for more than 20 years and engine can be\nready to operate quickly.\n\nWith pumped propulsion feed systems and large total impulse, the inert propulsion system mass\n(including tanks) can be very low (thin tank walls and low tank pressure), allowing a high\npropellant mass fraction.\n\nMost propellants have nontoxic exhaust, which is environmentally acceptable.\n\nSame propellant feed system can supply several thrust chambers in different parts of the vehicle.\n\nCan provide component redundancy (e.g., dual check valves) to enhance reliability.\n\nWith multiple engines, can operate with one or more shut off (engine out capability).\n\nThe geometry of low-pressure tanks can be designed to fit most vehicles\u2019 space constraints (i.e.,\nmounted inside wing or nose cone).\n\nCan withstand many ambient temperature cycles.\n\nThe placement of propellant tanks within the vehicle can minimize the travel of the center of\ngravity during powered flight. This enhances the vehicle\u2019s flight stability and reduces flight\ncontrol forces.\n\nPlume radiation and smoke are usually low with many liquid propellants.\n",

A moving pintle design with a\nvariable throat area will allow random thrust changes, but experience is limited.\n\nIf combustion gases contain more than a few percent particulate carbon, aluminum, or other metal,\nthe exhaust will be smoky and the plume radiation will be intense.\n\nIntegrity of grain (cracks, unbonded areas) is difficult to determine in the field.\n\nThrust and operating duration will vary with initial ambient grain temperature and cannot be easily\ncontrolled. Thus the flight path, velocity, altitude, and range of a motor will vary with the grain\ntemperature.\n\nLarge boosters take a few seconds to start.\n\nThermal insulation is required in almost all rocket motors.\n\nCannot be hot fire tested prior to use.\n\nNeeds a safety provision to prevent inadvertent ignition, which would lead to an unplanned motor\nfiring.

Liquid Propellant Rocket Engine Disadvantages\n\nRelatively complex design, more parts or components, more things to go wrong.\n\nCryogenic propellants cannot be stored for long periods except when tanks are well insulated and\nescaping vapors are recondensed. Propellant loading occurs at the launch stand or the test\nfacility and requires cryogenic propellant storage facilities.\n\nSpills or leaks of several propellants can be hazardous, corrosive, toxic, and cause fires, but this\ncan be minimized with gelled propellants.\n\nMore overall weight for most short-duration, low-total-impulse applications (low propellant mass\nfraction).\n\nNonhypergolic propellants require an ignition system.\n\nTanks need to be pressurized by a separate pressurization subsystem. This can require\nhigh-pressure inert gas storage (2000\u201410,000 psi) for long periods of time.\n\nMore difficult to control combustion instability.\n\nBullet impact will cause leaks, sometimes a fire, but usually no detonations; gelled propellants can\nminimize or eliminate these hazards.\n\nA few propellants (e.g., red fuming nitric acid) give toxic vapors or fumes.\n\nUsually requires more volume due to lower average propellant density and the relatively inefficient\npackaging of engine components.\n\nIf vehicle breaks up and fuel and oxidizer are intimately mixed, it is possible (but not likely) for an\nexplosive mixture to be created.\n\nSloshing in tank can cause a flight stability problem, but it can be minimized with baffles.\n\nIf tank outlet is uncovered, aspirated gas can cause combustion interruption or instability.\n\nSmoky exhaust (soot) plume can occur with some hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nNeeds special design provisions for start in zero gravity.\n\nWith cryogenic liquid propellants there is a start delay caused by the time needed to cool the\nsystem flow passage hardware to cryogenic temperatures.\n\nLife of cooled large thrust chambers may be limited to perhaps 100 or more starts.\n\nHigh-thrust unit requires several seconds to start.\n",

Most of the\nitems from this list can be transformed into evaluation criteria. For a specific\nmission, the relevant items on these lists would be rank-ordered in accordance\nwith their relative importance. A quantification of many of the items would be\nneeded. These tables apply to generic rocket propulsion systems; they do not\ncover systems that use liquid\u2014solid propellant combinations.\n\nA favorite student question has been: Which are better, solid or liquid propel-\nlant rockets? A clear statement of strongly favoring one or the other can only be\nmade when referring to a specific set of flight vehicle missions. Today, solid pro-\npellant motors seem to be preferred for tactical missiles (air-to-air, air-to-surface,\nsurface-to-air, or short-range surface-to-surface) and ballistic missiles (long- and\nshort-range surface-to-surface) because instant readiness, compactness, and their\nlack of spills or leaks of hazardous liquids are important criteria for these appli-\ncations. Liquid propellant engines seem to be preferred for space-launched main\npropulsion units and upper stages, because of their higher specific impulse, rel-\natively clean exhaust gases, and random throttling capability. They are favored\nfor postboost control systems and attitude control systems, because of their ran-\ndom multiple pulsing capability with precise cutoff impulse, and for pulsed axial\nand lateral thrust propulsion on hit-to-kill defensive missiles. However, there are\nalways some exceptions to these preferences.\n\nWhen selecting the rocket propulsion system for a major new multiyear high-\ncost project, considerable time and effort are spent in evaluation and in developing\nrational methods for quantitative comparison. In part this is in response to gov-\nernment policy as well as international competition. Multiple studies are done by\ncompeting system organizations and competing rocket propulsion organizations;\nformal reviews are used to assist in considering all the factors, quantitatively\ncomparing important criteria, and arriving at a proper selection.\n\nComputer Integration\n\nBetter methods of design, development, manufacturing, and testing have accel-\nerated the selection and fabrication processes. Advances in computing power\nand better simulation of physical phenomena are multiplying the capabilities\nof propulsion systems organizations and particularly their design engineers. In\nsome of the larger commercial rocket engine systems organizations the design,\ndevelopment, testing, and production of new liquid rocket engines has been done\nessentially 100% by several separate computer systems during the last few years.\nSome of these programs are difficult to integrate or link.\n\nThe organization that is truly able to integrate or link the various functions\ninto a single new computer system will have an advantage over its competitors.\nTable 19-5 really represents a concept for an ideal integration and this has not\nyet been achieved. If only a few of the programs listed in this table would be\n",

The figure gives examples of the types of programs,\ndata, and information packages that are candidates and could be put on or linked\nto an integrated computer system with an accurate geometric three-dimensional\nmodel or digital description of the propulsion system at its core, (Ref. 19-6).\nSome parts of this table, such as management systems or accounting systems may\nnever be properly integrated. This table is not real, not complete and certainly not\nall of the items listed apply to any one particular rocket engine. Typical benefits of\ncomputer integration are the speed of design, and the potential speed-up in other\nparts of an organization, the larger number of iterations or optimization studies or\nanalyses, and the speed of obtaining and/or analyzing useful manufacturing data\nor test data, the instant transfer of information from one module to another or from\none department to another, all hopefully can be done much more quickly, more\naccurately, and in more detail. There are no more design drawings, much less\npaperwork in manufacturing, or vendors receiving computer information instead\nof papers.\n\nTable 19-5 contains items specifically related to liquid propellant rocket\nengines. This table does not identify the many interactions between items in\nthe table or between personnel involved in specific functions. The availability\nof data from prior propulsion systems can help to validate computer simulations\nof many functions listed in the table, such as combustion analysis, receiving\ninspection, or alternate start techniques.\n\n19.2. CRITERIA FOR SELECTION\n\nMany criteria used in selecting a particular rocket propulsion system are peculiar\nto the particular mission or vehicle application. However, some of these selection\nfactors apply to a number of applications, such as those listed in Table 19-6.\nAgain, this list is incomplete and not all the criteria in this table apply to every\napplication. The table can be used as a checklist to see that none of the criteria\nrelevant analyses and design studies listed here are omitted.\n\nHere are some examples of important criteria in a few specific applications. For\na spacecraft that contains optical instruments (e.g., telescope, horizon seeker, star\ntracker, or infrared radiation seeker) the exhaust plume must be free of possible\ncontaminants that may deposit or condense on optical windows, mirrors, lenses,\nphotovoltaic cells, or radiators, and degrade their performance, and be free of\nparticulates that could scatter sunlight into the instrument aperture, which could\ncause erroneous signals. Conventional composite solid propellants and pulsing\nstorable bipropellants are usually not satisfactory, but cold or heated clean gas\njets (H2, Ar, No, etc.) and monopropellant hydrazine reaction gases are usually\nacceptable. Another example is an emphasis on smokeless propellant exhaust\n",

Only a few solid propellants\nand several liquid propellants would be nearly smokeless and essentially free of\na vapor trail under all weather conditions.\n\nSeveral selection criteria may be in conflict with each other. For example,\nsome propellants with a very high specific impulse are more likely to experience\ncombustion instabilities. In liquid propellant systems, where the oxidizer tank is\npressurized by a solid propellant gas generator and where the fuel-rich hot pres-\nsurizing gases are separated only by a thin flexible diaphragm from the oxidizer\nliquid in the tank, there is a trade-off between a very compact system and no\npropellant dilution with dissolved gases and the potential for a damaging system\nfailure (fire, possible explosion, and malfunction of system) if the diaphragm leaks\nor tears. In electric propulsion, high specific impulse and modestly high thrust is\nusually accompanied by heavy power-generating and conditioning equipment.\n\nActual selection will depend on the balancing of the various selection factors\nin accordance with their importance (piority), benefits, or potential impact on\nthe system, and on quantifying as many of these selection factors as possible\nthrough analysis, extrapolation of prior experience/data, cost estimates, weights,\nand/or separate tests. See Ref. 19-5. Layouts, inert mass estimates, center-of-\ngravity analyses, vendor cost estimates, preliminary stress or thermal analysis,\nand other preliminary design efforts are usually necessary to put numerical values\non some of the selection parameters. A comparative examination of the interfaces\nof alternate propulsion systems is also a part of the process. Some propulsion\nrequirements are incompatible with each other and a compromise has to be made.\nFor example, the monitoring of extra sensors can prevent the occurrence of certain\ntypes of failures and thus enhance the propulsion system reliability, yet the extra\nsensors and control components contribute to the system complexity and their\npossible failures will reduce the overall reliability. The selection process may also\ninclude feedback when the stated propulsion requirements cannot be met or do\nnot make sense, and this can lead to a revision of the initial mission requirements\nor definition.\n\nOnce the cost, performance, and reliability drivers have been identified\nand quantified, the selection of the best propulsion system for a specified\nmission proceeds. The final propulsion requirement may come as a result of\nseveral iterations and will usually be documented, for example, in a propulsion\nrequirement specification. A substantial number of records is required (such\nas engine or motor acceptance documents, CAD (computer-aided design)\nimages, parts lists, inspection records, laboratory test data, etc.). There are many\nspecifications associated with design and manufacturing as well as with vendors,\nmodels, and so on. There must also be a disciplined procedure for approving\nand making design and manufacturing changes. This now becomes the starting\npoint for the design and development of the selected propulsion system.\n",

The payload, flight regime, vehicle, launch\nenvironment, and operating conditions are established. The risks, as perceived, appear\nacceptable. The project implementing the mission must have political, economic, and\ninstitutional support with assured funding. The propulsion system requirements, which are\nderived from mission definition and the vehicle definition, must be reasonable and must result in\na viable propulsion system.\n\nAffordability (Cost)\n\nEstimated life-cycle costs are acceptable. They are the sum of R&D costs, production costs, facility\ncosts, operating costs, and decommissioning costs, from inception to the retirement of the system\n(see Ref. 19-7). Benefits of achieving the mission should appear to justify costs. Investment in\nnew facilities should be low. Few, if any, components should require expensive materials. For\ncommercial applications, such as communications satellites, the return on investment must look\nattractive. Minimize the hiring of new, inexperienced personnel, who need to be trained and are\nmore likely to make expensive errors. Cost comparisons of the selected engine with alternate\npropulsion systems has been favorable.\n\nSystem Performance\n\nThe propulsion system is designed to optimize vehicle and system performance, using the most\nappropriate and proven technology. Inert mass is reduced to a practical minimum, using\nimproved materials and better understanding of loads and stresses. Residual (unused) propellant\nis minimal. Propellants have the highest practical specific impulse without undue hazards,\nwithout excessive inert propulsion system mass, and with simple loading, storing, and handling.\nThrust\u2014time profiles and number of restarts must be selected to optimize the vehicle mission.\nVehicles must operate with adequate performance for all the possible conditions (pulsing,\nthrottling, temperature excursions, etc.). Vehicles should be storable over a specified lifetime.\nWill meet or exceed operational life. Performance parameters (e.g., chamber pressure, ignition\ntime, or nozzle area ratio) should be near optimum for the selected mission. Vehicle should have\nadequate TVC. Solid propellant has enough strength and elongation to avoid grain cracks with\ndaily temperature cycling and rough handling. Erosion in electric propulsion (electrodes,\nacceleration grids, nozzles) or in solid propellant motor nozzle throat are acceptable. TVC and\nattitude control thrusters conform to their requirements.\n\nSurvivability (Safety)\n\nAll hazards are well understood and known in detail. If failure occurs, the risk of personnel injury,\ndamage to equipment, facilities, or the environment is minimal. Certain mishaps or failures will\nresult in a change in the operating condition or the safe shutdown of the propulsion system.\nApplicable safety standards must be obeyed. Inadvertent energy input to the propulsion system\n(e.g., bullet impact, external fire) should not result in a detonation. The probability for any such\ndrastic failures should be very low. Safety monitoring and inspections must have proven\neffective in identifying and preventing a significant share of possible incipient failures (see Ref.\n19-8). Adequate safety factors must be included in the design. Spilled liquid propellants should\ncause no undue hazards. All systems and procedures must conform to the applicable safety\nstandards. Launch test range has accepted the system as being safe enough to launch. Specified\nlife of propulsion system has been proven feasible. Provisions are available to prevent solid\nmotors from being stored at temperatures beyond the specified ambient temperature limits.\n\nReliability\n\nStatistical analyses of test results indicate a satisfactory high-reliability level. Technical risks,\nmanufacturing risks, and failure risks are very low, well understood, and the impact on the\n\n(Continued)\n",
    "721": "704 SELECTION OF ROCKET PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nTABLE 19-6. (Continued)\noverall system is known. There are few complex components. Adequate storage and operating\nlife of components (including propellants) have been demonstrated. If certain likely failures\noccur, the system must shut down safely. Redundancy of key components should be provided,\nwhere effective. High probability that all propulsion functions must be performed within the\ndesired tolerances. Risk of combustion vibration or damaging mechanical vibration should be\nzero or very close to zero. Long life requirements can be met. See Ref. 19-7.\n\nControllability\n\nThrust buildup and decay are within specified limits. Combustion is stable under all operating\nconditions. The time responses to control or command signals are within acceptable tolerances.\nControls need to be foolproof and not inadvertently create a hazardous condition. Thrust vector\ncontrol response must be satisfactory. Mixture ratio control must assure nearly simultaneous\nemptying of the fuel and oxidizer tanks. Thrust from and duration of afterburning should be\nnegligible. Accurate thrust termination feature must allow selection of final velocity of flight.\nChanging to a certain alternate mission profile should be feasible. Liquid propellant sloshing and\npipe oscillations need to be adequately controlled. In a zero-gravity environment, a propellant\ntank should be essentially fully emptied.\n\nMaintainability\n\nSimple servicing, foolproof adjustments, easy parts replacement, and fast, reliable diagnosis of\ninternal failures or problems. Minimal hazard to service personnel. There must be easy access to\nall components that need to be checked, inspected, or replaced. Trained maintenance personnel\nare available.\n\nGeometric Constraints\n\nPropulsion system fits into vehicle, into available engine compartment volume, meet specified\nlength, or vehicle diameter. There is usually an advantage for the propulsion system that has the\nsmallest volume or the highest average density. If the travel of the center of gravity has to be\ncontrolled, as is necessary in some missions, the propulsion system can do so.\n\nPrior Related Experience\n\nThere is a favorable history and valid, available, relevant data of similar propulsion systems or\ncritical components supporting the practicality of the technologies, manufacturability,\nperformance, and reliability. Experience and validated computer simulation programs are\navailable. Experienced, skilled personnel are available. Successful flight history.\n\nOperability\n\nSimple to operate. Validated operating manuals exist. Procedures for loading propellants, arming\nthe power supply, launching, igniter checkout, and so on, must be simple. If applicable, a\nreliable automatic status monitoring and checkout system should be available. Crew training\nneeds to be minimal. Should be able to ship the loaded vehicle on public roads or railroads\nwithout need for environmental permits and without the need for a decontamination unit and\ncrew to accompany the shipment. Supply of spare parts assured.\n\nProducibility\n\nEasy to manufacture, inspect, and assemble. All key manufacturing processes are well proven and\nunderstood. All materials are well characterized, critical material properties are well known, and\nthe system can be readily inspected. Proven vendors for key components have been qualified.\nUses standard manufacturing machinery and relatively simple tooling. Hardware quality and\npropellant properties must be repeatable. Scrap should be minimal. Designs must make good use\nof standard materials, parts, common fasteners, and off-the-shelf components. There should be\nmaximum use of existing manufacturing facilities and equipment. Excellent reproducibility, i.e.,\nminimal operational variation between identical propulsion units or their components. Validated\nspecifications should be available for major manufacturing processes, inspection, critical parts\nfabrication, and assembly. The make-or-buy decisions will consider the selection criteria.\nExisting standards and manufacturing specifications apply. Deliverable assemblies or\ncomponents will essentially be identical to each other.\n",
    "722": "19.3. INTERFACES 705\n\nTABLE 19-6. (Continued)\n\nSchedule\n\nThe overall mission can be accomplished on a time schedule that allows the system benefits to be\nrealized. R&D, qualification, flight testing, and/or initial operating capability are completed on a\npreplanned schedule. No unforeseen delays. Critical materials and qualified suppliers must be\nreadily available.\n\nEnvironmental Acceptability\n\nNo unacceptable damage to personnel, equipment, or the surrounding countryside. No toxic species\nin the exhaust plume. Noise in communities close to a test or launch site should remain within\ntolerable levels. Minimal risk of exposure to cancer-causing chemicals. Hazards must be\nsufficiently low, so that issues on environmental impact statements are not contentious and\napprovals by environmental authorities become routine. There should be compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations. No unfavorable effects from currents generated by an\nelectromagnetic pulse, static electricity, or electromagnetic radiation.\n\nReusability\n\nSome applications (e.g., shuttle main engine, shuttle solid rocket booster, or aircraft rocket-assisted\naltitude boost) require a reusable propulsion system. The number of flights, serviceability, and\nthe total cumulative firing time then become key requirements that will need to be demonstrated.\nFatigue failure and cumulative thermal stress cycles can be critical in some of the system\ncomponents. The critical components have been properly identified; methods, instruments, and\nequipment exist for careful checkout and inspection after a flight or test (e.g., certain leak tests,\ninspections for cracks, bearing clearances, etc.). Replacement and/or repair of unsatisfactory\nparts should be readily possible. Number of firings before disassembly should be large, and time\ninterval between overhauls should be long.\n\nOther Criteria\n\nRadio signal attenuation by exhaust plume to be low. A complete propulsion system, loaded with\npropellants and pressurizing fluids, can be storable for a required number of years without\ndeterioration or subsequent performance decrease. Interface problems are minimal. Provisions\nfor safe packaging and shipment are available. The system includes features that allow\ndecommissioning (such as to deorbit a spent satellite) or disposal (such as the safe removal and\ndisposal of over-age propellant from a refurbishable rocket motor). Ground support equipment is\ncompatible. See Table 19-7. When future engine growth versions can be predicted, then it may\nbe cost effective to design some key components in such a way that they easily can be modified\nor strengthened with minimal effort and some extra mass. See Ref. 19-8. Heat transfer,\nparticularly radiative heat transfer, from hot components (such as a gas generator) or from the\nexhaust gas plume to the near-by vehicle components or structure or to test facilities or to the\nenvironment, must be low enough not to cause overheating. Disconnect fitting between\nengine/vehicle and launch stand/ground must not leak; they disengage and close automatically\nwhen vehicle lifts off launch stand.\n\n19.3. INTERFACES\n\nIn Section 19.2 the interfaces between the propulsion system and the vehicle\n\nand/or overall system were identified as some of the criteria and studies to be\n\nconsidered in the selection of a propulsion system. See also Ref. 19-5. A few\n\nrocket propulsion systems are easy to integrate and interface with the vehicles.\n\nFurthermore, these interfaces are an important aspect of a disciplined design and\n\ndevelopment effort.

    "727": "CHAPTER 20\nSS\nROCKET EXHAUST PLUMES\n\nThis chapter provides an introduction to the subject, general background, a\ndescription of various plume phenomena, their analysis and effects, and references\nfor further study.\n\nThe plume is the moving formation of hot rocket exhaust gases (and often\nalso with entrained small particles) outside the rocket nozzle. This gas formation\nis not uniform in structure, velocity, or composition. It contains several different\nflow regions and supersonic shock waves. It is usually visible as a brilliant flame,\nemits intense radiation energy in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet segments of\nthe spectrum, and is a strong source of noise. Many plumes leave a trail of smoke\nor vapor and they can discharge toxic exhaust gases. At higher altitudes the plume\ngases can spread over large distances, and a small portion of the plume gases can\nflow backward around the nozzle and reach components of the flight vehicle.\n\nThe plume characteristics (size, thrust level, shape, structure, emission inten-\nsity of photons or sound pressure waves, visibility, electrical interference, or\nsmokiness) depend not only on the characteristics of the particular rocket propul-\nsion system or its propellants, but also on the flight path, flight velocity, altitude,\nweather conditions, such as winds, humidity, or clouds, and the particular vehi-\ncle configuration. See Refs. 20\u20141 to 20-3. Progress has been steady in recent\ndecades in gaining understanding of the complex, interacting physical, chemical,\noptical, aerodynamic, and combustion phenomena within plumes by means of\nlaboratory experiments, computer simulation, measurements on plumes during\nstatic firing tests, flight tests, or simulated altitude tests in vacuum test cham-\nbers. Yet some is not fully understood or predictable.

PLUME APPEARANCE AND FLOW BEHAVIOR\nFigure 20-1 shows a simplified sketch of the front part of the nozzle exhaust\nplume of a large propulsion system operating at low altitude. The plume starts at\nthe nozzle exit plane of the rocket propulsion system, where it has its smallest\ncross section. It expands in diameter as the plume gases move rapidly away from\nthe vehicle. The flow at this nozzle exit is not uniform as explained in Chapter 3.\nThe relative velocity between the exhaust gases of the plume (which have the\nsame velocity as the vehicle) and the ambient air diminishes along the length\nof the plume, eventually approaching zero near the tail end of the plume. Small\npropulsion systems with low thrust have small plumes and thus emit much less\nradiation energy.\n\nThe inviscid core of the plume expands until the dynamic pressure of the\nexternal flow forces it to turn. The only way for a supersonic flow to turn is with\nan oblique shock wave, also called barrel shock, as will be explained later. This\nintercepting oblique shock wave curves toward the plume axis, where a strong\nnormal shock wave, of a diameter smaller than the nozzle exit, has been formed.\n\nMixing layer\nSlip line.

    "730": "20.1. PLUME APPEARANCE AND FLOW BEHAVIOR 713\nThe inner flow is reflected at its boundary as an oblique expansion shock wave\nor as a reflection wave. The region immediately behind the normal shock wave\nis subsonic and very hot. In this normal shock wave the energy of the incoming\nsupersonic flow velocity is converted into lower energy subsonic velocity and\na major increase in thermal energy or local temperature. This normal wave and\nthe hot subsonic region immediately downstream of it are clearly visible with\nmany liquid propellants. Shock waves will be discussed later in this Chapter.\nAfter flowing through the hot subsonic zone, the gases in the plume flow are\nrecompressed. This series of supersonic oblique and normal shock waves repeat\nthemselves to form a characteristic pattern often called Mach diamonds, because\nof the diamond-shaped visible appearance. These Mach diamonds expand in scale\nwith increasing altitude.\n\nIn the mixing layer (identified in Fig. 20-1) the hot gases from the plume\n(usually fuel rich with extra Hz and CO) mix with the ambient air and burn with\nthe oxygen of the air. This secondary combustion creates extra heat and causes\nthe temperature in the mixing layer to rise by several hundred degrees. There-\nfore the mixing layer is usually a strong radiation emitter. With some propellants\n(LOX/LH, or LOX/alcohol) the mixing layer is transparent and the Mach dia-\nmonds in the core are clearly visible. With most solid propellants and with certain\nstorable liquid propellants, this mixing layer is not transparent, in part because of\nthe emission and absorption by suspended particles. Much of the infrared radia-\ntion from the inner plume core is obscure or absorbed by the bright outer mixing\nlayer.\n\nWhen axis of the plume is aligned with the vehicle axis, then a straight inner\ncore and a symmetrical mixing layer are formed as seen in Fig. 20-1 and the\nsketches and information in Table 20-2. The plume shape and the mixing layer\nwith air are geometrically very different, if the plume is at right angles to the\nvehicle axis, as is the case with target-homing upper stages of antimissile vehicles.\nIn the case of a retrorocket the firing direction of the propulsion system is in a\ndirection opposite to the vehicle\u2019s flight direction and the plume shape is again\nchanged, but it is symmetrical (Ref. 20-4).\n\nTable 20\u20142 shows three simple sketches of the change of plume configuration\nwith altitude and lists their heat sources. In general the length and diameter of the\nplumes increase with altitude in the atmosphere, the temperatures and pressures\nwithin the plume become smaller along the length of the plume, and the plume\ntypically becomes larger than the vehicle. All hot parts of a plume emit radiation.\nThe first sketch is really a longer version of the plume in Fig. 20-1. It has a\nlong inviscid core (exhaust gases that have not yet been mixed with air) with\nmany Mach diamonds. At low altitude (under 5 km) when p2 = p3 the shape of\nthe plume is nearly cylindrical and the mixing layer is also cylindrical or slightly\nconical. The second sketch identifies the three regions of a plume. In the transient\nregion the shock waves and the radiation diminish with every Mach diamond and\nmore of the exhaust gas is mixed with ambient air. At higher altitudes (10 to\n25 km) the nozzle exit pressure p2 exceeds the atmospheric pressure p3 and the\nplume spreads out further and becomes larger. At even higher altitudes (above\n",

Two relatively large diameter shock waves can be\nseen in the third sketch; one is in the thin air just ahead of the flight vehicle and\nis known as the bow shock wave. It occurs when the vehicle exceeds supersonic\nvelocity. The other shock wave is attached to the tail end of the flight vehicle\nand is called the exhaust gas shock wave. A smaller version of this shock also\nappears at lower altitudes. In the far field (tail end of plume) the ambient air and\nthe exhaust gases are fairly well mixed throughout a cross section of the plume\nand the local pressure is essentially that of the local ambient air.\n\nAs the supersonic exhaust gas flow emerges from the nozzle, it experiences\nPrandtl\u2014Meyer type of expansion waves, which attach themselves to the nozzle\nexit lip. This expansion allows the outer streamlines just outside the nozzle to\nbe bent and an increase in the Mach number of the gases in the outer layers of\nthe plume. This expansion can, at higher altitudes, cause some small portion of\nthe supersonic plume to be bent by more than 90\u00b0 from the nozzle axis.

This backward flow needs to be analyzed to estimate the\nheat and impingement effects and possible contamination of vehicle components\n(see Ref. 20-6).\n\nThe boundary layer next to the nozzle exit internal wall is a region of viscous\nflow, and the flow velocity is lower than in the main nozzle inviscid flow. The\nvelocity decreases to zero right next to the wall. For large nozzles this boundary\nlayer can be quite thick, say 2 cm or more. Figure 3\u201416 shows a subsonic and a\nsupersonic region within the boundary layer inside the nozzle divergent section; it\nalso shows a temperature and a velocity profile. While the supersonic flow layer\nis restricted in the angle through which it can be deflected, the subsonic boundary\nlayer flow at the nozzle lip is in a continuum regime and may be deflected by up\nto 180\u00b0. Although the subsonic boundary layer represents only a small portion of\nthe mass flow, it nevertheless lets its exhaust gases flow backward on the outside\nof the nozzle. This backflow has caused heating of and sometimes chemical\ndamage to the vehicle and propulsion system parts.\n\nThe mass distribution or relative density is not uniform, as can be seen in\nFig. 20-2, which is based on a calculated set of data for a high-altitude plume.\nHere 90% of the flow is within +44\u00b0 of the nozzle axis and only one hundred\nthousandth, or 1075, of the total mass flow is bent by more than 90\u00b0.\n\nFigure 20-3 shows simplified sketches of the radiation intensity and the shape\nof the plumes for three propulsion systems, each driving one of three stages\u2014all\npart of a single flight vehicle. The radiation is measured by a space-based sen-\nsor with a limited field of view, perhaps 1 x 1 km. Gaseous plumes radiate and\nabsorb radiation only at specific narrow wave lengths or spectrum frequencies.\nEach chemical species in the exhaust (H2, H20, CO, No, etc.) has its own char-\nacteristic emission wave lengths. These gases do not contain any particulates.\nThe rise of the total emission intensity with altitude of the booster propulsion\nsystem curve is due to an increase in the plume diameter and a decrease in the\natmospheric absorption between the booster and the space-based sensor. The sub-\nsequent decrease of its total intensity can be explained as the gradual decrease in\nafterburning as the vehicle gains altitude. The gap in the curves is due to stage\nseparation (termination of booster thrust and subsequent start of the sustainer\npropulsion system). The sustainer has a lower thrust and a smaller plume and\nthus less total radiation intensity. The radiation intensity of the sustainer propul-\nsion system rises as its plume expands and the radiating gas volume becomes\nlarger. The decrease of the intensity shown in the figure is due to the limited field\nof view of the specific sensor, which can only see a piece of the large plume.\nThe actual intensity increases somewhat, as seen by the dotted line in Fig. 20-3.\n\nIn the upper portion of Fig. 20-3 each sketch shows a key plume dimension,\nsome shock waves, and the plume\u2019s shape.

When the plume gas exit pressure is close to the\nambient air pressure at altitude, the initial shape of the sustainer stage propulsion\nsystem plume will be nearly cylindrical and similar in shape to the initial booster\nplume shape, but smaller. The initial sustainer plume size and radiation intensity\nare small compared to the final booster plume, and this is in part responsible for\nthe initial trough in the curve of the sustainer propulsion system in Fig. 20-3.\nAs the mixing of air and plume diminishes with altitude, the emissions due to\nafterburning also diminish, and this is also partly responsible for the trough.

(Adapted with permission from Ref. 20-1.)\n\nThe multiple thrust chamber propulsion systems (typically 6 to 12 small\nthrusters) of the third stage (it could be a satellite or a multiple warhead upper\nstage) have much lower thrusts and even much smaller plumes than the other\ntwo stages, and thus their radiation intensities are the lowest. The only portion\nof the plumes hot enough to emit significant radiation is the inviscid core just\ndownstream of the nozzle exit. Also radiation can come from the very hot gases\nin the small combustion chambers, but it can only be observed within a narrow\nangle through its nozzle. The radiations from these small thrusters are difficult\nto observe, because the intensity is small and often difficult to distinguish from\nthe background radiation from the earth.\n\nThe booster and sustainer vehicles both operate in that part of the atmosphere\nwhere continuum flow prevails; that is, the mean free paths of the molecular\nmotions are relatively small, frequent collisions between molecules occur, the\ngases follow the basic gas laws, and they can experience compression or expan-\nsion waves. As higher altitude is reached, the continuum regime changes into a\nfree molecular flow regime, where there are fewer molecules per unit volume and\nthe mean free path of the molecules between collisions becomes larger than the\nkey dimension of the vehicle (e.g., length). Here the plume spreads out even more,\nsome reaching diameters in excess of 10 km.

The phenomenology of rocket exhaust plumes as seen from a\nspace-based surveillance system is described in Ref. 20-1.\n\nSpectral Distribution of Radiation\n\nGas species radiate is specific narrow bands of the spectrum. The primary radia-\ntion emissions from most of the plume gases are usually in narrow bands of the\ninfrared spectrum, to a lesser extent narrow bands in the ultraviolet spectrum,\nwith relatively little energy in the visible spectrum. The emissions depend on\nthe size, particular propellants, their mixture ratio, and their respective exhaust\ngas compositions. For example, the exhaust from the liquid hydrogen\u2014liquid\noxygen propellant combination contains mostly water vapor and hydrogen, and\nwith a minor percentage of oxygen and dissociated species. Its radiation is\nstrong in specific wavelength bands characteristic of the emissions from these\nhot gases (such as 2.7 and 6.3 um, water\u2014infrared region) and 122 nanometers\n(hydrogen\u2014ultraviolet region). As shown in Fig. 20\u20144, the hydrogen\u2014oxygen\nplume is essentially transparent or colorless, since there are no strong emissions\nin the visible segment of the spectrum. The visibe radiation from the white Mach\ndiamonds are due to chemical reactions of the minor species O2, OH, H, or O\nin the hot center region. The propellant combination of nitrogen tetroxide with\nmethylhydrazine fuel gives strong emissions in the infrared region; in addition\nto the strong emissions for H2O and hydrogen mentioned previously, there are\nstrong emissions for CO, at 4.7 um, CO at 4.3 um, and weaker emission in\nthe ultraviolet (UV) and visible ranges (due to bands of CN, CO, No, NH3,\nand other intermediate and final gaseous reaction products). This gives it a pink\norange\u2014yellow color, but the plume is still partly transparent.\n\nThe exhausts of many solid propellants and some liquid propellants contain\nalso solid particles and some contain also condensed liquid droplets. In this\nbook the term \u201cparticulate\u201d covers both types. In Tables 5\u20148 and 5-9 examples\nof solid propellant were given that had about 10% of small particles as aluminum\noxide (Al2O3) in their incandescent white exhaust plumes; some kerosene-burning\nliquid propellants and many solid propellants have a small percentage of soot\nor small carbon particles in their exhaust. Receeding thermal insulation of solid\npropellant rocket motors can also contribute solid carbon particles to the exhausts.\nThe radiation spectrum from hot solids is a continuous one, which peaks usually\nin the infrared (IR) region, but it also has strong emissions in the visible or UV\nregion; this continuous spectrum is usually stronger in the visible range than the\nnarrow-band emissions from the gaseous species in the plume. Afterburning in\nthe mixing layer increases the temperature of the particles by several hundred\ndegrees and intensifies their radiation emissions. Even with only 2 to 5% solid\nparticles, the plumes radiate brilliantly and are therefore very visible to the eye.\nHowever, these particles in the outer layers of the plume obscure the central core\nand the shock wave patterns can no longer be observed.\n\nThe visible radiation of plumes from double-base propellant can be reduced\nor suppressed by adding a small amount (1 to 3%) of potassium compound.

Certain\ngases condense to form liquid droplets at a particular liquefying temperature,\nirrespective of the location or the stream line within the plume.

The principal observable effect would\nbe to scatter sunlight. The lower half of this figure shows solid alumina particles.\nSome of the larger particles can persist through the nozzle into the plume before\nsolidifying by radiation cooling (Refs. 20\u20141 and 20-4).\n\nPlumes with particulates remain visible by scattered sun light for a relatively\nlong time even after the vehicle has gone.

See Ref. 20-1.\n\nThe total radiation from the plume gases heats adjacent vehicle or propulsion\nsystem components. The prediction of radiative emission requires an understand-\ning of the plume and the absorption of radiation by intervening atmospheric or\nplume gases (see Refs. 20-1 and 20-7). The heat transferred from the plume\nto vehicle components (by radiation and some by convection) will depend on\nthe propellant combination, the nozzle configuration, the vehicle geometry, size,\nthe number of nozzles, the trajectory, altitude, and the secondary turbulent flow\naround the nozzles and the tail section of the vehicle.\n\nThe observed or measured values of the radiation emissions have to be cor-\nrected. The signal strength diminishes as the square of the distance between\nthe plume and the observation station, and its observed magnitude can change\ntremendously during a flight. The attenuation is a function of wavelength, rain,\nfog or clouds, the mass of air and gases between the hot part of the plume and\nthe observing location, and depends on the flight vector direction relative to the\nline of sight. The total emission is a maximum when seen at right angles to the\nplume (see Refs. 20-1, 20-3, and 20-7). Radiation measurements can be biased\nby background radiations (important in satellite observation) or Doppler shift.\nMultiple Nozzles\nIt is common to have more than one propulsion system operating at the same\ntime, or more than one nozzle sending out hot exhaust gas plumes. For example,\nthe Space Shuttle has three main engines and two solid rocket boosters running\nsimultaneously. The interference and impingement of these plumes with one\nanother will cause regions of high temperature in the combined plumes and\ntherefore larger emissions, but the emissions will no longer be axisymmetrical.\nAlso, the multiple nozzles can cause distortions in the airflow near the rear end of\nthe vehicle and influence the vehicle drag and augment the hot backflow from the\nplume locally. With multiple propulsion systems the plumes impinge locally with\neach other and can create local hot spots. At high altitudes the plumes of multiple\npropulsion systems appear to merge into each other; analytically it can at times\nbe approximated as that from an equivalent single nozzle providing the total flow,\nbut with the properties and characteristics of the individual nozzles (Ref. 20-4).\nPlume Signature\nThis is the term used for all the characteristics of the plume in the infrared,\nvisible, and ultraviolet spectrum, its electron density, smoke or vapor, for a\nparticular vehicle, mission, rocket propulsion system, and propellant (see Refs.\n20-3, 20-9, and 20-10). In many military applications it is desirable to reduce\nthe plume signature in order to minimize being detected or tracked. The initial\nstagnation temperature of the nozzle exit gas is perhaps the most significant factor\ninfluencing plume signature. As plume temperatures increase, higher levels of\n",

Emissions can be reduced if\na propellant combination or mixture ratio with a lower combustion temperature is\nselected; unfortunately, this usually gives a lower performance. Ways to reduce\nsmoke are described later in this Chapter. The plume signature is today often\nspecified as a requirement for a new or modified rocket-propelled military flight\nvehicle, and it imposes limits on spectral emissions in certain regions of the\nspectrum and on the amount of acceptable smoke.\n\nThe atmosphere absorbs energy in certain regions of the spectrum. For\nexample, the air contains some carbon dioxide and water vapor. These molecules\nabsorb and attenuate the radiation in the frequency bands peculiar to these two\nspecies. Since many plume gases contain a lot of CO) or HO, the attenuation\nwithin the plume itself can be significant. The plume energy or intensity, as\nmeasured by spectrographic instruments, has to be corrected for the attenuation\nof the intervening air or plume gas.\n\nVehicle Base Geometry and Recirculation\n\nThe geometry of the nozzle exit(s) and the flight vehicle\u2019s tail or aft base have an\ninfluence on the plume. Figure 20-6 shows a single nozzle exit whose diameter\nis almost the same as the base or tail diameter of the vehicle body. If these two\ndiameters are not close to each other, then a flat doughnut-shaped base or tail\nsurface will exist. In this region the high-speed combustion gas velocity is usually\nlarger than the air speed of the vehicle (which is about the same as the local air\nvelocity relative to the vehicle) and an unsteady flow vortex-type recirculation\nwill occur. This greatly augments the afterburning, the heat release to the base,\nand usually creates a low pressure on this base. This lower pressure in effect\nincreases the vehicle\u2019s drag.\n\nThe airflow pattern at the vehicle tail can be different with different tail geome-\ntries, such as cylinder (straight), a diminishing diameter, or an increasing diameter\nconical shape, which helps to maintain the vehicle\u2019s aerodynamic stability. The\nairflow pattern and the mixing layer change dramatically with angle of attack,\ntail fins, or wings, causing an unsymmetrical plume shape. Flow separation of the\nairflow can also occur. In some cases the recirculation of fuel-rich exhaust gas\nmixed with air will ignite and burn; this dramatically increases the heat transfer\nto the base surfaces and causes some changes in plume characteristics.\nCompression and Expansion Waves\nA shock wave is a surface of discontinuity in a supersonic flow. In rocket plumes\nit is the very rapid change of kinetic energy to potential and thermal energy\nwithin that very thin wave surface.

Such a normal shock\nproduces the largest increase in pressure (and local downstream temperature) and\nis known as a normal shock wave. The flow velocity behind a normal shock wave\nis subsonic. When the incoming flow is at an angle less than 90\u00b0 to the shock\nwave surface, it is known as a weak compression wave or as an oblique shock\nwave. Figure 20-7 illustrates the flow relationships and shows the angle of flow\nchange. The temperature of the gas immediately behind a normal shock wave\napproaches the stagnation temperature of the combustion chamber. Here the radi-\nation increases greatly.

It occurs at a surface where the flow undergoes a\nPrandtl\u2014Meyer expansion wave, which is a surface where pressure is reduced\nand velocities are increased. Often there is a series of weak expansion waves\nnext to each other; this occurs outside the lip of the diverging nozzle exit section\nwhen the nozzle exit gas pressure is higher than the ambient air pressure, as\nshown in Fig. 20-1.\n",

    "742": "20.2. PLUME EFFECTS 725\n20.2. PLUME EFFECTS\nSmoke and Vapor Trails\nSmoke is objectionable in a number of military missiles. It interferes with the\ntransmission of optical signals, such as with a line-of-sight or electro-optical\nguidance system. Smoke would also hamper the vision of a soldier who guides a\nwire-controlled antitank weapon. Smoke, or a vapor trail, allows easy and rapid\ndetection of a missile being fired, and visually tracking the flight path can reveal\na covert launch site. Smoke is produced not only during rocket operation, but\nalso by chuffing, the irregular combustion of solid propellant remainders after\nrocket cutoff. Chuffing, described in Chapter 14, produces small puffs of flame\nand smoke at frequencies of perhaps 2 to 100 Hz.\n\nPrimary smoke is a suspension of many very small solid particles in a gas,\nwhereas secondary smoke is a set of condensed small liquid droplets suspended\nin a gas, such as condensed vapor trails, fog, or clouds. Secondary smoke can\nform in all-gas plumes and also in plumes that contain primary smoke. Many\npropellants leave visible trails of smoke and/or vapor from their plumes during\npowered rocket flight (see Refs. 20-3, 20-8, and 20-9). These trails are shifted\nby local winds after the vehicle has passed. They are most visible in the daytime,\nbecause they depend on reflected or scattered sunlight. The solid particles that\nform the primary smoke are mainly aluminum oxide (Al203, typically 0.1 to 3 um\ndiameter) in composite solid propellants. Other solid particles in the exhaust of\nsolid propellant are unburned aluminum, zirconium or zirconium oxide (from\ncombustion stabilizer), or iron or lead oxides (in burn-rate catalyst). Carbon\nparticles or soot can be formed from the thermal insulation of various solid\npropellants grains and some liquid propellants using hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nDuring the external expansion of rocket exhaust plume gases the gas mixture\nis cooled by radiation, gas expansion, and convection with colder ambient air to\nbelow its dew-point temperature, where the water vapor condenses. Of course,\nthis depends on local weather conditions. If the ambient temperature is low (e.g.,\nat high altitude) and/or if the gas expands to low temperatures, the water droplets\ncan freeze to form small ice crystals or snow. At high altitude, CO2, HCl, and\nother gases can also condense. Many rocket exhaust gases contain between 5 and\n35% water, but the exhaust from the liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen propellant\ncombination can contain as much as 80%. If the exhaust contains tiny solid\nparticles, these then act as nuclei upon which water vapor can condense, thus\nincreasing the amount of nongaseous material in the plume, making the plume\neven more visible.\n\nIf reducing smoke in the plume is important to the mission, then a reduced-\nsmoke solid propellant or a minimum-smoke propellant is often used. Alterna-\ntively a liquid propellant combination, known not to form small carbon particles,\nmay be selected. They are described in Chapters 7 and 13. Even then, a secondary\nsmoke trail can be formed under cold-weather and high-humidity conditions.\nHowever, under some weather conditions it will be difficult to see a trail con-\ntaining vapor only.\n",
    "743": "726 ROCKET EXHAUST PLUMES\n\nToxicity\n\nThe exhaust gases from many rocket propulsion systems contain toxic and/or\ncorrosive gas species, which can cause severe health hazards and potential envi-\nronmental damage near launch or test sites. Accidental spills of some liquid\noxidizers, such as nitrogen tetroxide or red fuming nitric acid, can create toxic,\ncorrosive gas clouds, which have higher density than air and will stay close to\nthe ground. Exhaust gases such as CO or COQ present a health hazard if inhaled\nin concentrated doses. Gases such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) from solid pro-\npellants using a perchlorate oxidizer, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen tetroxide\n(N20q4), or vapors of nitric acid (HNO3) have relatively low levels of allowable\ninhalation concentration before health damage can occur. Chapter 7 lists some of\nthe safe exposure limits. The potential damage increases with the concentration\nof the toxic species in the exhaust, the mass flow or thrust level, and the duration\nof the rocket firing at or near the test/launch site.\n\nDispersion by wind and diffusion and dilution with air can reduce the\nconcentrations of toxic materials to tolerable levels within a few minutes, but\nthis depends on the quantity and the local weather conditions, as explained in\nChapter 21. Careful attention is therefore given to scheduling the launch or test\noperations at times when the wind will carry these gases to nearby uninhabited\nareas. For very highly toxic exhaust gases (e.g., those containing beryllium\noxide or certain fluorine compounds), and usually for relatively small thrust\nlevels, the exhaust gases in static test facilities are captured, chemically treated,\ndetoxified, and purified before release into the atmosphere.\n\nNoise\n\nAcoustical noise is an unavoidable by-product of thrust; it is particularly impor-\ntant in large launch vehicles with large propulsion systems. It is a primary design\nconsideration in the vehicle and in much of the ground-support equipment, par-\nticularly electronic components. Besides being an operational hazard to personnel\nin and around rocket-propelled vehicles, it can be a severe annoyance to commu-\nnities near rocket test sites. The acoustic power emitted by the Saturn V space\nflight vehicle at launch is about 2 x 108 W, enough to light up about 200,000\naverage homes if it were available as electricity.\n\nAcoustic energy emission is mainly a function of exhaust velocity, mass of gas\nflow, exhaust gas density, and the velocity of sound in the quiescent medium.\nIn these terms, the chemical rocket is the noisiest of all aircraft and missile\npropulsion devices. Sound intensity is highest near the nozzle exit and diminishes\nwith the square of the distance from the source. Analytical models of noise from\na rocket exhaust usually divide the plume into two primary areas, one being\nupstream of the shock waves and one being downstream (subsonic), with high-\nfrequency sound coming from the first and low-frequency from the second. The\nshock wave itself is a generator of sound, as is the highly turbulent mixing of the\nhigh-velocity exhaust with its reltively quiescent surroundings. Sound emission\nis normally measured in terms of microbars (ubar) of sound pressure, but is also\n",

The relationship that exists among a decibel scale, the power, and intensity\nscales is difficult to estimate intuitively since the decibel is a logarithm of a\nratio of two power quantities or two intensity quantities. Further, expression of\na decibel quantity must also be accompanied by a decibel scale reference, for\nexample, the quantity of watts corresponding to 0 dB. In the United States, the\nmost common decibel scale references 10~!? W power, whereas the European\nscale references 10-!? W.\n\nA large rocket can generate a sound level of about 200 dB (reference 10~!3 W),\ncorresponding to 107 W of sound power, compared to 140 dB for a 75-piece\norchestra generating 10 W. Reducing the sound power by 50% reduces the value\nby only about 3 dB. In terms of human sensitivity, a 10-dB change usually\ndoubles or halves the noise for the average person. Sound levels above 140 dB\nfrequently introduce pain to the ear and levels above 160 become intolerable.\nIn small propulsion systems the noise level is very much lower and often can\nbe ignored. There is a remarkable similarity between the spectra of infrared and\nacoustic radiation (Ref. 20\u20144).\n\nSpacecraft Surface Contamination\n\nContamination of sensitive surfaces of a spacecraft by rocket exhaust products\ncan be a problem to vehicle designers and users. When deposited on a surface it\ncan degrade the function of surfaces, such as solar cells, optical lenses, radiators,\nwindows, thermal-control coatings, and mirrored surfaces. Propellants that have\ncondensed liquids or solid particles in their exhaust appear to be more trouble-\nsome than propellants with mostly gaseous products, such as oxygen\u2014hydrogen\nor monopropellant hydrazine. Plumes from most solid propellants contain con-\ntaminating species. Practically all the investigative work has been concerned\nwith small storable liquid propellant attitude control pulse motors in the thrust\nrange 1.0 to 500 N, the type commonly used for controlling vehicle attitude\nand orbit positioning over long periods of time. Deposits of hydrazinium nitrate\nand other materials have been found. The accumulation of exhaust products on\nsurfaces is a function of many variables, including the propellants, combustion\nefficiency, combustion pressure, nozzle expansion ratio, surface temperature, and\nrocket\u2014vehicle interface geometries. The prediction of exhaust contamination of\nspacecraft surfaces is only partly possible through analytical calculations. Refer-\nence 20-10 provides a comprehensive analytical model and computer program\nfor liquid bipropellant rockets.\n\nAnother effect of clouds of condensed species (either tiny liquid droplets or\nsolid particles) is to scatter sunlight and cause solar radiation to be diverted to\noptical instruments on the spacecraft, such as cameras, telescopes, IR trackers,\nor star trackers; this effect can cause erroneous instrument measurements. The\nscatter depends on the plume location relative to the instruments, the propellant,\nthe density and size of particulates, the sensitive optical frequency, and the surface\ntemperature of the instrument.\n",
    "745": "728 ROCKET EXHAUST PLUMES\n\nRadio Signal Attenuation\n\nRocket exhaust plumes generally interfere with the transmission of radio-\nfrequency signals that must pass through the plume in the process of guiding\nthe vehicle, radar detecting, or communicating with it. Solid propellant exhaust\nplumes usually cause more interference than liquid rocket engine plumes. Signal\nattenuation is a function of free electron density and electron collision frequency.\nGiven these two parameters for the entire plume, the amount of attenuation a\nsignal experiences in passing through the plume can be calculated. Figure 20-8\nshows the minimum plume model sufficient for predicting signal attenuation that\ncontains contours of constant electron density and electron collision frequency\nfor momentum transfer. Free-electron density and activity in the exhaust plume\nare influenced by many factors, including the propellant formulation, propellant\nalkali impurities, exhaust temperature, motor size, chamber pressure, flight\nspeed and altitude, and the distance downstream from the nozzle exit. Methods\nhave been developed for analyzing (with computers) the physical and chemical\ncomposition, including electron density, and the attenuation characteristics of\nexhaust plumes (Refs. 20-11 to 20-13).\n\nThe relationship between several influential motor and vehicle design fac-\ntors can be summarized from experience with typical solid propellant rockets as\nfollows:\n\n1. The presence of alkali metal impurities increases attenuation; changing the\nimpurity level of potassium from 10 to 100 ppm increases the relative\nattenuation some 10-fold at low altitude. Both potassium (* 150 ppm) and\nsodium (* 50 ppm) are impurities in commercial-grade nitrocellulose and\nammonium perchlorate.\n\n) nozzle\nElectron density\ncontours, electrons/cm3\nFIGURE 20-8. Exhaust plume model for predicting attenuation of radio communications\nsignals. The contours shown are for either equal electron density or electron collision\nfrequency; the highest values are near the nozzle exit.\n",
    "746": "20.3. ANALYSIS AND MATHEMATICAL SIMULATION 729\n\n2. The percentage of aluminum fuel is a major influence; increasing the per-\ncentage from 10 to 20% increases the attenuation fivefold at sea level and\nthree- to fourfold at 7500 m altitude.\n\n3. Increasing the chamber pressure for a given aluminized propellant from\n100 to 2000 psi reduces the relative attenuation by about 50%.\n\n4. Attenuation varies with the distance downstream from the nozzle exit plane\nand can be four to five times as great as at the nozzle exit plane, depending\non the flight altitude, nozzle geometry, oxidizer-to-fuel ratio, flight velocity,\naltitude, and other parameters.\n\nFor many solid rocket applications, attenuation of radio or radar signal strength\nby the exhaust plume is no problem. When it is, attenuation can usually be kept\nat acceptable levels by controlling the level of alkali impurities in propellant\ningredients and by using nonmetal fuels or a low percentage (< 5%) of aluminum.\nMotors with high expansion ratio nozzles help, since electrons combine with the\npositive ions as the exhaust temperature falls.\n\nThe electrons in the plume greatly increase its radar cross section, and hot\nplumes can readily be picked up with radar. The plume is usually a stronger radar\nreflector than the flight vehicle. A radar homing missile seeker would focus on\nthe plume and not the vehicle. A reduction of the plume cross section is desirable\n(lower gas temperature, less sodium impurities).\n\nPlume Impingement with Structures\n\nIn most reaction control systems there are several small thrusters and they are\npointed in different directions. Although small thrusters have small plumes and\nthe intensity of their radiation emissions is much lower, they have caused severe\ndamage. There have been cases where the plumes of some of these thrusters\nhave impinged upon a space vehicle surface, such as extended solar cell panels,\nradiation heat rejection surfaces, or aerodynamic control surfaces. This is more\nlikely to happen at high altitude, where the plume diameters are large. This can\nlead to the overheating of these surfaces and to unexpected turning moments.\n\nAlso, during stage separation, there have been occasions where the plume of\nthe upper stage impinges on the lower vehicle stage. This can cause overheating\nand impact damage not only to the lower stage (being separated), but by reflection\nalso to the upper stage. Other examples are docking maneuvers or the launching\nof multiple rockets (nearly simultaneously) from a military barrage launcher. The\nplume of one of the rocket missiles impinges on another flying missile and causes\nit to experience a change in flight path, often not hitting the intended target.\n20.3.

Although there has been remarkable progress in using mathematical\nsimulations of plume phenomena, the results of such computer analyses are not\nalways reliable or useful for making predictions of many of the plume character-\nistics; however, the models help in understanding the plumes and in extrapolating\ntest results to different conditions within narrow limits. There are some physical\nphenomena in plumes that are not yet fully understood.\nAll simulations are really approximations, to various degrees; they require\nsimplifying assumptions to make a reasonable mathematical solution possible,\nand their field of application is usually limited. They are aimed at predicting\ndifferent plume parameters, such as temperature or velocity or pressure profiles,\nradar cross section, heat transfer, radiations, condensation, deposits on optical\nsurfaces, impact forces, or chemical species. The analyses are usually limited to\nseparate spatial segments of the plume (e.g., core, mantle, supersonic versus sub-\nsonic regions, continuum versus free molecular flow, near or far field), and many\nhave different assumptions about the dynamics or steadiness of the flow (many\nneglect turbulence effects or the interaction between boundary layers and shock\nwaves). Most are suitable only for steady-state conditions. The algorithms are also\ndifferent in the treatment of chemical reactions, solids content, energy releases,\ncomposition changes within the plume, different flight and altitude regimes, the\ninteractions with the airflow and the vehicle, or selected regions of the spectrum\n(e.g., IR only). Many require assumptions about particle sizes, their amounts,\nspatial and size distribution, gas velocity distribution, the geometry and bound-\naries of the mixing layer, or the turbulence behavior. The mathematical models\nare complex and can use one-, two-, or three-dimensional models. The analysis\nof a plume often requires using more than one model to solve for different pre-\ndictions. Several models are given in Refs. 20-14 to 20-18. Many solutions are\nbased in part on extrapolating measured data from actual plumes to guide the\nanalyses. The specific analytical approaches are beyond the scope of this book\nand their mathematical resolutions are the domain of experts in this field. There\nare validated computer programs for a number of plume phenomena. Many are\nproprietary or limited in distribution.\nThe actual measurements on plumes during static and flight tests are used to\nverify the theories and they require highly specialized instrumentation, careful\ncalibrations and characterization, skilled personnel, and an intelligent application\nof various correction factors. Extrapolating the computer programs to regions or\nparameters that have not been validated has often given poor results.\nPROBLEMS\n1.

TYPES OF TESTS\n\nBefore rocket propulsion systems are put into operational use, they are subjected\nto several different types of tests, some of which are outlined below in the\napproximate sequence in which they are normally performed.\n\n1. Manufacturing inspection and fabrication tests on individual parts (dimen-\nsional inspection, pressure tests, X rays, leak checks, electric continuity,\nelectromechanical checks, etc.).\n\n2. Component tests (functional and operational tests on igniters, nozzles, insu-\nlation, valves, thrusters, controls, injectors, structures, etc.).\n\n3. Static rocket propulsion system tests (with complete propulsion system)\non a test stand: (a) complete propulsion system tests (under rated condi-\ntions, off-design conditions, with intentional variations in environment or\ncalibration); (b) with liquid propellants a partial or simulated rocket oper-\nation (for proper function, calibration, ignition, operation\u2014often without\nestablishing full thrust or operating for the full duration); for a reusable\nor restartable rocket propulsion system this can include many starts, long-\nduration endurance tests, and postoperational inspections and recondition-\ning.\n\n4. Static vehicle tests (when rocket propulsion system is installed in a\nrestrained, nonflying vehicle or stage) on a vehicle static test stand.\n\n733\n",
    "751": "734 ROCKET TESTING\n5. Flight tests: (a) with a specially instrumented or new propulsion system in\na developmental flight test vehicle; (b) with a production vehicle.\n\nEach of these five types of tests can be performed on at least three basic types\nof programs:\n\n1. Research on and development or improvement of a new (or modified)\n\nrocket engine or rocket motor, their propellants, materials, or components.\n\n2. Evaluation of the suitability of a new (or modified) rocket engine or novel\n\nrocket motor for a specified application or for flight readiness.\n\n3. Production and quality assurance of a rocket propulsion system.\n\nThe first two types of programs are usually concerned with a novel or mod-\nified device and often involve the testing and measurement of new concepts or\nphenomena using experimental rockets. The testing of a new solid propellant\ngrain, the development of a novel control valve assembly, and the measurement\nof the thermal expansion of a nozzle exhaust cone during firing operation are\nexamples.\n\nProduction tests concern themselves with the measurement of a few basic\nparameters on production propulsion systems to assure that the performance,\nreliability, and operation are within specified tolerance limits. If the number\nof units is large, the test equipment and instrumentation used for these tests are\nusually partly or fully automated and designed to permit the testing, measurement,\nrecording, and evaluation in a minimum amount of time.\n\nDuring the early development phases of a program, many special and unusual\ntests are performed on components and complete rocket systems to prove specific\ndesign features and performance characteristics. Special facilities and instrumen-\ntation or modification of existing test equipment are used. Examples are large\ncentrifuges to operate propulsion systems under acceleration or variable frequency\nvibration equipment for shaking complete systems and components. During the\nsecond type of program, some special tests are usually conducted to determine the\nstatistical performance and reliability of a rocket system by operating a number\nof units of the same design. During this phase tests are also made to demonstrate\nthe ability of the rocket system to withstand extreme limits of the operating\nconditions, such as high and low ambient temperature, variations in fuel com-\nposition, changes in the vibration environment, or exposure to moisture, rain,\nvacuum, or rough handling during storage. To demonstrate safety, sometimes,\nintentional malfunctions, spurious signals, or manufacturing flaws are introduced\ninto the propulsion system, to determine the capability of the control system or\nthe safety devices to handle and prevent a potential failure.\n\nBefore an experimental rocket system can be flown in a vehicle it usually has\nto pass a set of preliminary flight rating tests aimed at demonstrating its safety,\nreliability, and performance. It is not a single test, but a series of tests under var-\nious specified conditions operating limits, and performance tolerances, simulated\nenvironments, and intentional malfunctions. Thereafter the rocket system may be\n",

However, before it can be put into production, it\nusually has to pass another specified series of tests under a variety of rigorous\nspecified conditions, known as the qualification test or preproduction test. Once\na particular propulsion system has been qualified, or passed a qualification test,\nit is usually forbidden to make any changes in design, fabrication processes, or\nmaterials without going through a careful review, extensive documentation, and\noften also a requalification test.\n\nThe amount and expense of testing of components and complete propulsion\nsystems has decreased greatly in the last few decades. The reasons are more\nexperience with prior similar systems, fewer development engines and fewer\ntests, better sensors, better analytical model simulations, use of health monitoring\nsystems to identify incipient damage, which saves hardware, and more confidence\nin predicting a number of failure modes and their locations. Validated computer\nprograms have removed many uncertainties and obviated needs for tests. In some\napplications the number of firing tests has decreased by a factor of 10 or more.\n21.2. TEST FACILITIES AND SAFEGUARDS\nFor chemical rocket propulsion systems, each test facility usually has the follow-\ning major systems or components:\n\n1. A test cell or test bay where the article to be tested is mounted, usually\nin a special test fixture. If the test is hazardous, the test facility must have\nprovisions to protect operating personnel and to limit damage in case of an\naccident.\n\n2. An instrumentation system with associated computers for sensing, main-\ntaining, measuring, analyzing, correcting, and recording various physical\nand chemical parameters. It usually includes calibration systems and timers\nto accurately synchronize the measurements.\n\n3. A control system for starting, stopping, and changing the operating condi-\ntions.\n\n4. Systems for handling heavy or awkward assemblies, supplying (or remov-\ning) liquid propellant, and providing maintenance, security, and safety.\n\n5. For highly toxic propellants and toxic plume gases it has been required to\ncapture the hazardous gas or vapor (firing inside a closed duct system),\nremove almost all of the hazardous ingredients (e.g., by wet scrubbing\nand/or chemical treatment), allow the release of the nontoxic portion of\nthe cleaned gases, and safely dispose of any toxic solid or liquid residues\nfrom the chemical treatment. With an exhaust gas containing fluorine, for\nexample, the removal of much of this toxic gas can be achieved by scrub-\nbing it with water that contains dissolved calcium; it will then form calcium\nfluoride, which can be precipitated and removed.\n\n6. In some tests specialized test equipment and unique facilities are needed\nto conduct static testing under different environmental conditions or under\n",
    "753": "736 ROCKET TESTING\n\nsimulated emergency conditions. For example, high and low ambient\ntemperature tests of large motors may require a temperature-controlled\nenclosure around the motor; a rugged explosion-resistant facility is needed\nfor bullet impact tests of propellant-loaded missile systems and also for\ncook-off tests, where gasoline or rocket fuel is burned with air below\na stored missile. Similarly, special equipment is needed for vibration\ntesting, measuring thrust vector forces and moments in three dimensions,\nor determining total impulse for very short pulse durations at low thrust.\n\nMost rocket propulsion testing is now accomplished in sophisticated facilities\nunder closely controlled conditions. Modern rocket test facilities are frequently\nlocated several miles from the nearest community to prevent or minimize effects\nof excessive noise, vibrations, explosions, and toxic exhaust clouds. Figure 21-1\nshows one type of an open-air test stand for vertically down-firing large liquid\npropellant thrust chambers (100,000 to 2 million pounds thrust). It is best to\nfire the propulsion system in a direction (vertical or horizontal) similar to the\nactual flight condition. Figure 21\u20142 shows a simulated altitude test facility for\nrockets of about 10.5 metric tons thrust force (46,000 Ibf). It requires a vacuum\nchamber in which to mount the engine, a set of steam ejectors to create a vacuum,\nwater to reduce the gas temperature, and a cooled diffuser. With the flow of\nchemical rocket propellant combustion gases it is impossible to maintain a high\nvacuum in these kinds of facilities; typically, between 15 to 4 torr (20 to 35 km\naltitude) can be maintained. This type of test facility allows the operation of rocket\npropulsion systems with high-nozzle-area ratios that would normally experience\nflow separation at sea-level ambient pressures.\n\nPrior to performing any test, it is common practice to train the test crew\nand go through repeated dry runs, to familiarize each person with his or her\nresponsibilities and procedures, including the emergency procedures.\n\nTypical personnel and plant security or safety provisions in a modern test\nfacility include the following:\n\n1. Concrete-walled blockhouse or control stations for the protection of per-\nsonnel and instruments (see Fig. 21-3) remote from the actual rocket\npropulsion location.\n\n2. Remote control, indication, and recording of all hazardous operations and\nmeasurements; isolation of propellants from the instrumentation and control\nroom.\n\n3. Automatic or manual emergency water deluge and fire-extinguishing sys-\ntems.\n\n4. Closed circuit television systems for remotely viewing the test.\n\n5. Warning signals (siren, bells, horns, lights, speakers) to notify personnel to\nclear the test area prior to a test, and an all-clear signal when the conditions\nare no longer hazardous.\n",

    "757": "740 ROCKET TESTING\n\nfrom fires, explosions, or from the intentional destruction of vehicles in flight or\nrockets on the launch stand. Environmental government regulations usually limit\nthe maximum local concentration or the total quantity of toxic gas or particulates\nreleased to the atmosphere. The toxic nature of some of these liquids, vapors,\nand gases has been mentioned in Chapters 7 and 13. One method of control is\nfor tests with discharges of moderately toxic gases or products to be postponed\nuntil favorable weather and wind conditions are present.\n\nIn the analysis of ground tests, the toxic cloud source is analysed as a point\nsource, and in flight tests it is a ribbon source. The rate of exhaust cloud diffu-\nsion is influenced by many propulsion variables, including propellant, propulsion\nsystem size, exhaust temperature, and thrust duration; by many atmospheric\nvariables, including wind velocity, direction, turbulence, humidity, and vertical\nstability or lapse rate, and by the surrounding terrain. Extensive analytical stud-\nies and measurements of the environmental exposure from explosions, industrial\nsmoke, and gases, and exhausts from missile and space vehicle launchings give\nbackground useful for predicting the atmospheric diffusion and downwind con-\ncentrations of rocket exhaust clouds. Reference 21\u20142 describes hazards and toxic\ngas cloud dispersals and concentrations. Reference 21-3 evaluates the environ-\nmental impact of rocket exhausts from large units on the ozone in the stratosphere\nand on the ground weather near the test site; it concludes that the impacts are\ngenerally small and temporary. Reference 21\u20144 describes a test area atmospheric\nmeasuring network.\n\nA widely used relationship for predicting atmospheric diffusion of gas clouds\nhas been formulated by O. G. Sutton (Ref. 21-5). Many of the most modern\nequations and models relating to downwind concentrations of toxic clouds are\nextensions of Sutton\u2019s theory.

TEST FACILITIES AND SAFEGUARDS 741\nhighly turbulent conditions to | as a limit for extremely stable conditions, and\nusually falling between 0.10 and 0.50.\n\nA few definitions basic to the study of atmospheric diffusion of exhaust clouds\n\nare as follows:\n\n1. Micrometeorology. Study and forecasting of atmospheric phenomena\nrestricted to a region approximately 300 m above the earth\u2019s surface and\na horizontal distance of approximately 5 miles.\n\n2. Lapse Rate. The rate of decrease in temperature with increasing height\nabove the earth\u2019s surface. The standard atmosphere (Appendix 2) has a\nlapse rate of about 6.4\u00b0C per 1000 m. Lapse rate is also affected by altitude,\nwind, and humidity.\n\n3. Inversion, or Inversion Layer. Condition of negative lapse rate (temperature\nincreases with increasing height). Usually formed near the ground at night.\n\nThe following are a few general rules and observations derived from experi-\n\nence with the atmospheric diffusion of rocket exhaust clouds:\n\n1. Inversion presents a very stable layer and greatly reduces the vertical dis-\npersion (the higher the lapse rate, the greater the vertical dispersion).\n\n2. A highly stable atmospheric condition tends to keep the exhaust plume or\ncloud intact and away from the earth\u2019s surface except when the exhaust\nproducts are much heavier than the surrounding air.\n\n3. High wind increases the rate of diffusion and reduces the thermal effects.\n\n4. For short firings (< 500 sec) the approximate dosages downwind are about\nthe same as from an instantaneous point source.\n\n5. When the plume reaches about one-fourth the distance to a given point\nbefore emission is stopped, peak concentration will be about three-fourths\nof that from a continuous source of equal strength.\n\n6. The presence of an inversion layer significantly restricts the mixing or dif-\nfusion capacity of the propulsion system exhaust gases into the atmosphere;\nthe effective air mass is that mass existing between the Earth\u2019s surface and\nthe inversion layer.\n\n7. Penetration of the inversion layer due to the buoyance force of the hot\nexhaust cloud seldom occurs.\n\n8. Earth surface dosage drops rapidly when missiles or space launch vehicles\nare destroyed in flight above a height of 1500 m as compared to lower\naltitudes of 600 to 1000 m.\n\nInterpretation of the hazard that exists once the concentration of the toxic\nagent is known also required knowledge of its effects on the human body,\nplants, and animals. Government tolerance limits for humans are given\nin Chapter 7 and in Ref. 7\u20145. There are usually three limits of interest:\none for the short-time exposure of the general public, one for an 8-hr\n",
    "759": "742 ROCKET TESTING\nexposure limit of workers, and an evacuation concentration. Depending on\nthe toxic chemical, the 8-hr limit may vary from 5000 ppm for a gas such\nas carbon dioxide, to less than 1 ppm for an extremely toxic substance\nsuch as fluorine. Poisoning of the human body by exhaust products usually\noccurs from inhalation of the gases and fine solid particles, but the solid\nresiduals that sometimes remain around a test facility for weeks or months\nfollowing a test firing can enter the body through cuts and other avenues.\nAlso, certain liquid propellants cause burns and skin rash or are poisonous\nwhen ingested, as explained in Chapter 7.\n\n21.3. INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nConsiderable progress has been made. For further study the reader is referred\n\nto standard textbooks on instruments and computers used in testing, such as\n\nRef. 21\u20146. Some of the physical quantities measured in rocket propulsion testing\n\nare:\n\n1. Forces (thrust, thrust vector control side forces, short thrust pulses).\n\n2. Flows (hot and cold gases, liquid fuel, liquid oxidizer, leakage).\n\n3. Pressures (chamber, propellant, pump, tank, etc.).\n\n4. Temperatures (chamber or case walls, propellant, structure, nozzle).\n\n5. Timing and command sequencing of valves, switches, igniters, and so on.\n\n6. Stresses, strains, and vibrations (combustion chamber, structures, solid\n\npropellants, liquid propellant lines, local accelerations of vibrating parts)\n(Ref. 21-7).\n\n7. Time sequence of events (ignition, attainments of full pressure).\n\n8. Movement and position of parts (valve stems, gimbal position, deflection\n\nof parts under load or heat).\n\n9. Voltages, frequencies, and currents in electrical or control sub-\n\nsystems.\n\n10. Visual observations (flame configuration, test article failures, explosions)\nusing high-speed cameras or video cameras.\n\n11. Special quantities such as turbopump shaft speed, liquid levels in\npropellant tanks, burning rates, flame luminosity, or exhaust gas compo-\nsition.\n\nReference 21-8 gives a description of specialized diagnostic techniques used\nin propulsion systems, such as using nonintrusive optical methods, microwaves,\nand ultrasound for measurements of temperatures, velocities, particle sizes, or\nburn rates in solid propellant grains. Many of these sensors incorporate special-\nized technologies and, often, unique software. Each of the measured parameters\ncan be obtained by different types of instruments, sensors, and analyzers, as\nindicated in Ref. 21-9.\n",
    "760": "21.3. INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT \u2014- 743\nMeasurement System Terminology\nEach measurement or each measuring system usually requires one or more\nsensing elements (often called transducers or pickups), a device for recording, dis-\nplaying, and/or indicating the sensed information, and often also another device\nfor conditioning, amplifying, correcting , or transforming the sensed signal into\nthe form suitable for recording, indicating, display, or analysis. Recording of\nrocket propulsion test data has been performed in several ways, such as on chart\nrecorders or in digital form on memory devices, such as on magnetic tapes or\ndisks. Definitions of several significant terms are given below and in Ref. 21-6.\n\nRange refers to the region extending from the minimum to the maximum rated\nvalue over which the measurement system will give a true and linear response.\nUsually an additional margin is provided to permit temporary overloads without\ndamage to the instrument or need for recalibration.\n\nErrors in measurements are usually of two types: (1) human errors of improp-\nerly reading or incorrectly adjusting the instrument, chart, or record and of\nimproperly interpreting or correcting these data, and (2) instrument or system\nerrors, which usually fall into four classifications: static errors, dynamic response\nerrors, drift errors, and hysteresis errors (see Refs. 21\u20146 and 21-10). Static errors\nare usually fixed errors due to fabrication and installation variations; these errors\ncan usually be detected by careful calibration, and an appropriate correction can\nthen be applied to the reading. Drift error is the change in output over a period of\ntime, usually caused by random wander and environmental conditions. To avoid\ndrift error the measuring system has to be calibrated at frequent intervals at stan-\ndard environmental conditions against known standard reference values over its\nwhole range. Dynamic response errors occur when the measuring system fails\nto register the true value of the measured quantity while this quantity is chang-\ning, particularly when it is changing rapidly. For example, the thrust force has a\ndynamic component due to vibrations, combustion oscillations, interactions with\nthe support structure, and the like. These dynamic changes can distort or amplify\nthe thrust reading unless the test stand structure, the rocket mounting structure,\nand the thrust measuring and recording system are properly designed to avoid\nharmonic excitation or excessive energy damping. To obtain a good dynamic\nresponse requires a careful analysis and design of the total system.\n\nA maximum frequency response refers to the maximum frequency (usually\nin cycles per second) at which the instrument system will measure true val-\nues. The natural frequency of the measuring system is usually above the limiting\nresponse frequency. Generally, a high-frequency response requires more complex\nand expensive instrumentation. Most of the instrument system (sensing elements,\nmodulators, and recorders) must be capable of a fast response. Most of the mea-\nsurements in rocket testing are made with one of two types of instruments: those\nmade under nearly steady static conditions, where only relatively gradual changes\nin the quantities occur, and those made with fast transient conditions, such as\nrocket starting, stopping, or vibrations (see Ref. 21-11). This latter type of instru-\nment has frequency responses above 200 Hz, sometimes as high as 20,000 Hz.\n",
    "761": "744 ROCKET TESTING\nThese fast measurements are necessary to evaluate the physical phenomena of\nrapid transients.\n\nLinearity of the instrument refers to the ratio of the input (usually pressure,\ntemperature, force, etc.) to the output (usually voltage, output display change,\netc.) over the range of the instrument. Very often the static calibration error\nindicates a deviation from a truly linear response. A nonlinear response can cause\nappreciable errors in dynamic measurements. Resolution refers to the minimum\nchange in the measured quantity that can be detected with a given instrument.\nDead zone or hysteresis errors are often caused by energy absorption within the\ninstrument system or play in the instrument mechanism; in part, they limit the\nresolution of the instrument.\n\nSensitivity refers to the change in response or reading caused by special influ-\nences. For example, the temperature sensitivity and the acceleration sensitivity\nrefer to the change in measured value caused by temperature and acceleration.\nThese are usually expressed in percent change of measured value per unit of\ntemperature or acceleration. This information can serve to correct readings to\nreference or standard conditions.\n\nErrors in measurement can arise from many sources. Reference 21-12 gives\na standardized method, including mathematical models, for estimating the error,\ncomponent by component, as well as the cumulative effect in the instrumentation\nand recording systems.\n\nElectrical interference or \u201cnoise\u201d within an instrumentation system, including\nthe power supply, transmission lines, amplifiers, and recorders, can affect the\naccuracy of the recorded data, especially when low-output transducers are in use.\nMethods for measuring and eliminating objectionable electrical noise are given\nin Ref. 21-13.\n\nTest Measurements\n\nFor every test of a rocket propulsion system or one of its components there\nshould be one or more objectives, an identification of the article to be tested,\na description of the test, an identification of the test facility, a list of specific\nmeasurements to be performed, instructions on storing, analyzing or displaying\nof the data, an interpretation of the results, and a conclusion.\n\nIn many tests, especially with large liquid propellant rocket engines, the data\ngenerated can be very large. Manual analysis of the data by skilled individu-\nals was the original method, but it is too cumbersome. Today computers have\nbecome common place. They automatically correct the raw measured data, store\nit, analyze it, correct it, and display it. Some control systems can make decisions\nto control the engine and minimize test failure. This is really a version of a\nhealth monitoring system (HMS) described at the end of Section 11.5 and it is\nalso discussed in the next section..\n\nOften only a portion of the recorded data is actually analyzed or reviewed\nduring or after the test. In complex rocket propulsion system development tests,\nsometimes between 100 and 400 different instrument measurements are made\n",
    "762": "21.3. INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT \u2014- 7455\nand recorded. Some data need to be sampled frequently (e.g., some transients\nmay be sampled at rates higher than 1000 times per second), whereas other data\nneed to be taken at lower frequencies (e.g., temperature of mounting structure\nmay be needed only every | to 5 sec). Multiplexing of data is commonly prac-\nticed to simplify data transmission. Most rocket test computer systems contain a\nconfiguration file to indicate data characteristics for each channel, such as range,\ngain, the references, the type of averaging, the parameter characteristics, or the\ndata correction algorithms. Most of the data are not analyzed or printed out as\nhard copy; a detailed analysis occurs only if there is reason for understanding\nparticular test events in more detail. This analysis may occur months after the\nactual tests and may not even be done on the same computer.\n\nThe proper selection of the type, number of measurements, or frequency of\ndata collection is crucial in the sensing of the status of the health of the propulsion\nsystem to be tested. This selection is usually performed by the engineers working\non the development of the particular propulsion system, who can identify the\ncritical parameters which influence performance and likely impending failures.\n\nThe actual test measurements are performed with a variety of sensors, all mod-\nified to fit standard interfaces so they can be connected to a common computer\nor network. See Ref. 21-14. The measured outputs of each instrument or sensor\nare corrected for changes in the ambient temperatures, instrument calibration fac-\ntors, nonlinear outputs, conversion of analog data into digital form, or filtering\nof data signals to eliminate signals outside the range of interest. Recording of\ndata can be done by a computer in the engine, a computer on the ground, or in\nthe flight vehicle. Manipulation of data includes changing of scale or providing\na display (table, plots, or curves) of selected engine parameters in support of the\ndata analysis of the test results.\n\nHealth Monitoring System (HMS)\n\nThe HMS relies on receiving the corrected data inputs from selected sensors,\nwhose measurements were described in the prior paragraphs. HMSs are also dis-\ncussed in Section 11.5. From the simulated and validated analytical description\nof the propulsion system it is possible to derive the nominal (desired) values for\neach of the parameters and they are entered into the HMS computer. This can\ninclude the nominal chamber pressure, thrust, nozzle wall temperature, voltage,\nand many others for both steady-state and transient conditions\u2014all at various\ntimes of the engine operation. For each measured parameter and time this analyti-\ncal model provides a nominal value, an upper limit value, and a lower limit value\n(also known as red line values), which identify the safe operating range of that\nparameter. The analytical model usually also includes the transient conditions\n(start/stop). The values of each parameter is often validated (and sometimes cor-\nrected) by actual test data from prior successful firing tests of this type of rocket\nengine.\n\nThen an automatic comparison is made by the HMS computer between the\nactual measured corrected data and the same data from the analytical simulation.\n",
    "763": "746 ROCKET TESTING\n\nIt will show if the measured parameter is satisfactory (falls between the two\nlimit lines) or unsatisfactory, if the measurement exceeds the safe limits. Since\ndamage to a liquid propellant rocket engine can occur very quickly (in less than\na second) an immediate action is necessary. In an impending failure one or more\nother measurements will usually also exceed their safe limits. For example, if the\nturbine inlet temperature becomes too hot, turbine blades may be damaged. If the\nturbine inlet gas temperature exceeds its safe limit, then usually the turbopump\u2019s\nshaft speed and the turbine inlet manifold temperature will also exceed their\nsafe limits. By sensing an impending critical failure with more than one red line\nmeasurement, the likely incipient engine failure is confirmed and an occasional\nsingle sensor malfunction can be eliminated as a insufficient cause for starting a\nremedial action.\n\nDecisions on possible remedial action can be done very quickly on a computer,\ncertainly much faster than a decision by a human operator. If the computer\nreceives three simultaneous related measurements that exceed their safe limit\nvalues, and if all three are related to the same potential failure, then a remedial\naction is allowed. Then the computer will automatically query a table of remedies,\nand a corrective action, which fits the three overlimit values, is quickly identified\nand selected and this remedy is automatically initiated. For the turbine inlet\ntemperature example given above, this action may include throttling the total\nflow to the gas generator or changing the mixture ratio of the gas generator flow\n(provided the gas generator valves have a throttling capability) or to shut the\nengine down safely. This kind of fast action with decisions made by a computer\nhas saved much engine hardware in development testing. It is a relatively new\nfeature of rocket engine testing.\n\nFor some component tests programmable logic controllers are used to control\nthe test operation instead of a computer, which usually requires some software\ndevelopment.\n\n21.4. FLIGHT TESTING\n\nFlight testing of rocket propulsion systems is always conducted in conjunction\nwith tests of vehicles and other systems such as guidance, vehicle controls, or\nground support. These flights usually occur along missile and space launch ranges,\noften over the ocean. If a flight test vehicle deviates from its intended path\nand appears to be headed for a populated area, a range safety official (or a\ncomputer) will have to either cause a destruction of the vehicle, abort the flight,\nor cause it to correct its course. Many propulsion systems therefore include\ndevices that will either terminate the operation (shut off the rocket engine or open\nthrust termination openings into rocket motor cases as described in Section 14.3)\nor trigger explosive devices that will cause the vehicle (and therefore also the\npropulsion system) to disintegrate in flight.\n\nFlight testing requires special launch support equipment, means for observing,\nmonitoring, and recording data (cameras, radar, telemetering, etc.), equipment for\n",
    "764": "21.5. POSTACCIDENT PROCEDURES 747\nassuring range safety and for reducing data and evaluating flight test performance,\nand specially trained personnel. Different launch equipment is needed for different\nkinds of vehicles. This includes launch tubes for shoulder-held infantry support\nmissile launchers, movable turret-type mounted multiple launchers installed on an\narmy truck or a navy ship, a transporter for larger missiles, and a track-propelled\nlaunch platform or fixed complex launch pads for spacecraft launch vehicles. The\nlaunch equipment has to have provisions for loading or placing the vehicle into\na launch position, for allowing access of various equipment and connections to\nlaunch support equipment (checkout, monitoring, fueling, etc.), for aligning or\naiming the vehicle, or for withstanding the exposure to the hot rocket plume at\nlaunch.\n\nDuring experimental flights extensive measurements are often made on the\nbehavior of the various vehicle subsystems; for example, rocket propulsion\nparameters, such as chamber pressure, feed pressures, temperatures, and so on,\nare measured and the data are telemetered and transmitted to a ground receiving\nstation for recording and monitoring. Some flight tests rely on salvaging and\nexamining the test vehicle.\n\n21.5. POSTACCIDENT PROCEDURES\n\nIn the testing of any rocket propulsion system there will invariably be failures,\nparticularly when some of the operating parameters are close to their limit. With\neach failure comes an opportunity to learn more about the design, the materials,\nthe propulsion performance, the fabrication methods, or the test procedures. A\ncareful and thorough investigation of each failure is needed to learn the likely\ncauses and identify the remedies or fixes to prevent a similar failure in the future.\nThe lessons to be learned from these failures are perhaps the most important\nbenefits of development testing. A formalized postaccident approach is often used,\nparticularly if the failure had a major impact, such as high cost, major damage,\nor personnel injury. A major failure (e.g., the loss of a space launch vehicle or\nsevere damage to a test facility) often causes the program to be stopped and\nfurther testing or flights put on hold until the cause of the failure is determined\nand remedial action has been taken to prevent a recurrence.\n\nOf utmost concern immediately after a major failure are the steps that need\nto be taken to respond to the emergency. This includes giving first aid to injured\npersonnel, bringing the propulsion system and/or the test facilities to a safe,\nstable condition, limiting further damage from chemical hazards to the facility\nor the environment, working with local fire departments, medical or emergency\nmaintenance staff or ambulance personnel, and debris clearing crews, and quickly\nproviding factual statements to the management, the employees, the news media,\nand the public. It also includes controlling access to the facility where the failure\nhas occurred and preserving evidence for the subsequent investigation. All test\npersonnel, particularly the supervisory people, need to be trained not only in\npreventing accidents and minimizing the impact of a potential failure, but also\n",
