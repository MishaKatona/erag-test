Developing and operating space systems\nmeans achieving the lowest possible structural mass\nat the highest levels of efficiency and reliability under\nextreme environmental conditions of temperature,\nradiation and vacuum.\n\nAccordingly, the ability to develop and operate\nspace systems is not only an indicator of the techni-\ncal, scientific and industrial capacity of an individual\ncountry or an alliance of nations, but also a factor\nwhich significantly influences its economic competi-\ntiveness. Space activities are a powerful propellant for\ntechnical innovation.\n\nFM.indd xv\n\nToday satellite-based communication, navigation\nand weather forecasting are an integral part of daily life.\nGlobal monitoring of our world has become a neces-\nsity for studying climate development. Reconnaissance\nsatellites equipped with a wide variety of instruments\nare as essential for disaster management as they are for\nestablishing an adequate security policy.\n\nA multitude of probes are currently on a journey\nthrough outer space and will provide us with new in-\nsights in the area of physics and planetary evolution in\nour solar system. Space activities have already become a\nmuch larger part of our lives than many of us realize.\n\nThe development challenges described above are\nespecially applicable for the development human space\nflight systems. There is hardly a terrestrial transport\nsystem, no research station, however remote, in which\nthe lives of the people working there are as dependent\non the proper functioning and precise interactions of\nso many subsystems as in a rocket or space station.\n\n2/25/09 11:20:26 AM\n",
    "15": "FM.indd xvi\n\nFrom July to December 2006, for almost six months,\nThad the opportunity to live and work together with an\nAmerican and a Russian colleague on board the Inter-\nnational Space Station. Although our primary task was\nscientific research in a variety of disciplines, the effort\nrequired of us to operate such a station was relatively\nhigh. Meanwhile the European Columbus Laboratory\nwent into operation and when the crew is expanded\nto six people, as planned for mid 2009, it will be pos-\nsible to considerably increase the capacity to conduct\nexperiments on board the ISS. As far as the design of\nfuture human space flight systems is concerned, it will\nnot only be possible to learn a great deal while living\nand working in the ISS; the station can also be used as\na test environment for new technologies or improving\nexisting ones. There is for example the need to improve\nmethods for the analysis, diagnosis, maintenance and\nrepair of on-board systems, the further development\nof regenerative life support systems, and the testing of\ninnovative propulsion systems.\n\nThe major space agencies in West and East are tak-\ning the first steps to prepare for a return to the Moon.\n\nForeword\n\nThe question arises of what role Europe will play in\nthese remarkable and inspiring projects. Drawing on\nits universities, research institutions and industrial\ncapacity, Europe represented by the European Space\nAgency (ESA) could make a significant contribution\nto future human spaceflight.\n\nViewed against the background of Europe\u2019s histori-\ncal development with its wealth of explorers, research-\ners and scientists, I definitely regard space activities\nwith all their diverse technical, scientific and industrial\naspects as a cultural responsibility as well.\n\nI wish all readers of this handbook a pleasurable\nand rewarding experience, that pinch of intuition\nwhich is so often necessary when crossing borders and\ngaining new insights, and, not least, a very generous\nportion of curiosity and enthusiasm for their space\n\nactivities.\n\n2/25/09 11:20:41 AM\n",
    "16": "Preface\n\nDear reader,\n\nThe first German edition of the Handbook of Space\n\nTechnology was published in 1988, the second 11 years\n\nlater. Over the past 20 years there have been profound\n\nchanges in the engineering, materials, processes and\neven the politics associated with space technologies and\ntheir application. As a consequence, the third edition\nof the handbook, which you find here in its English\nversion, has been entirely rewritten. The editors pro-\nceeded in the same way in which they would approach\nthe task of developing a space system: a number of\ncomponents must be integrated into a system, which\nis then expected to fulfill its purpose.\n\nSo just as with any proper space mission, we begin\nwith the overall objective, the Mission Statement:\n\nThe Handbook of Space Technology is intended to\nacquaint students, engineers and physicists, as well as\nreaders with a serious interest in space activities, with\nthe design, construction and operation of a space\nsystem. This book also leads the way to a deeper under-\nstanding of the corresponding specialized areas.\n\nFrom this Mission Statement requirements can be\nderived. The Handbook of Space Technology should:\n\ne be readable as a whole, although it may require\nsome perseverance while also providing adequate\ninsights and information on selected topics;\n\ne present an overview of a space system in its\nentirety;\n\ne explain the underlying procedures for design,\nconstruction and operation;\n\ne contain references connecting separate chapters as\nan aid to increasing the reader\u2019s understanding.\n\nThe editors have deliberated on how these require-\nments could best be fulfilled. They decided in light of\ntheir own limitations not to write the book exclusively\nby themselves. After all, a space system is not built by\nthe system engineer alone; the approach is rather to\nconnect a great variety of components and parts ina\nmeaningful way. Accordingly, we have asked numerous\nspecialists to write various chapters, and in some cases\nsections within other chapters. These sections contain\nthe expertise of each of these specialists, but also fit\n\nFM.indd xvii\n\ninto the general concept of this book, fulfilling, as we\nhope, the Mission Statement.\n\nWhen integrating the various contributions the\neditors had to tread a narrow path. On the one hand,\nthe book was supposed to be readable as a smooth,\nunified whole. On the other hand, it was to reflect\neach author\u2019s unique approach to his or her field. In\naddition, the use of formulas and the significance of\ndiagrams and figures vary in the individual sections\nand chapters reflecting the characteristic style of the\nsubdisciplines. The character of the individual chap-\nters can serve to assist students in determining their\nown particular area of interest, and thus provide some\norientation for their studies.\n\nThe editors would like to use this opportunity to\nexpress their heartfelt gratitude to all the authors for\ntheir contributions and their patience throughout\nthe editorial process. The list of authors on the fol-\nlowing pages links them to individual chapters mak-\ning evident how much expertise has been involved,\nand shows to whom we owe our gratitude. It is also\nintended to give the reader an indication of which\nexperts in Europe can be consulted for further tech-\nnical information.\n\nThe English version is based on the third edition\nof the German Handbuch der Raumfahrttechnik pub-\nlished by Carl Hanser Verlag in 2007. In the translation\nthe book has been brought up to date (2008).\n\nThe editors wish to thank the publishers, especially\nMr Jochen Horn, for their support. They also thank\nMrs Monika Ebke (DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen) for her\nsuperb coordination of editors, authors and Carl Han-\nser Verlag. Last but not least, the editors thank Mrs\nSusan Giegerich and Dr.-Ing. Joachim Kehr (DLR,\nOberpfaffenhofen) for their valuable contributions\nto the translation of the book. The editors also thank\nMs Nicky Skinner, Miss Beth Dufour and Mr Eric\nWillner of John Wiley & Sons, Ltd for their substantial\neffort in preparing the English version.\n\nThe concept on which this book was based led to\nthe following divisions. Following an introduction\nwith a historical survey and the characterization of\nmission types in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 presents the\nfundamental preconditions and principles underlying\na space system. Chapters 3 through 7 characterize the\nsegments of a space system, from the transfer segment\n(Chapter 3) to the space vehicle (Chapter 4) and the\n\n2/25/09 11:20:41 AM\n",
    "17": "FM.indd xviii\n\nxviii\n\nground segment (Chapter 6) to user applications\nand payloads (Chapter 7). Several specific features of\nhuman space flight are described in Chapter 5. The\nconcluding chapters survey the tasks of the system\nengineer (Chapter 8) and space flight project man-\nagement, and address issues of quality assurance and\nspace law (Chapter 9).\n\nThe editors\u2019 desire to present not only an overview\nof space systems technology, but also an introduction\n\nPreface\n\nto the individual technical disciplines resulted in a\nwork of considerable substance. This calls for some\neffort and patience on the part of the reader. It required\nthe same from the editors, as we found out.\n\nNonetheless, we hope that the fascination of space\ncan be felt again and again when working with this\ntext, and that this will facilitate reading.\n\nWilfried Ley, Klaus Wittmann, Willi Hallmann\n\n2/25/09 11:20:41 AM\n",

    "22": "1 Introduction\n\nKlaus Wittmann, Willi Hallmann and Nicolaus Hanowski\n\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 marks the\nbeginning of the space age. Since 1957 more than\n5000 satellites and human spacecraft have entered\nspace and about 850 of them are still operational.\nThe utilization of a spacecraft ends when important\nsubsystems fail or with its controlled or uncontrolled\nreentry through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Every year\nmore new spacecraft are launched than old satellites\nreturn to Earth. Thus, the number of satellites in\nspace has been continuously growing in the past and\nis expected to continue to grow in the future. Space\nflight was initiated by the USA and the former Soviet\nUnion. Since then space projects have been conducted\nby all major industrialized countries. In addition, a\nnumber of developing countries have implemented\nspace programs. On a global scale the USA are still the\ndominant spacefaring nation according to the number\nof active spacecraft (see Figure 1.1).\n\n500\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n\n\u201cod\n0 |_|\n\nUSA Russia Asia Europe Others\n\nFigure 1.1: National distribution of operating spacecraft\n(2007).\n\nFollowing the initial period of non-military space\nflight, important commercial space activities evol-\nved. These include rocket systems, spacecraft and\npayloads in the areas of communication, navigation,\nremote sensing and meteorology.\n\nSpace missions are performed not only by single\nnations, but also by international companies and\nmultinational institutions such as the European Space\nAgency (ESA).\n\nCooperation between public entities and com-\nmercial companies is gaining importance in space\nflight projects. These cooperative projects are termed\npublic\u2014private partnerships or PPPs. An example of a\nPPP space project is the German mission TerraSAR-X\n(Figure 1.2) [1.2] with a high-resolution X-band radar\nas the main payload.\n\nFigure 1.2: The satellite TerraSAR-X, an example of a PPP mission,\nis operated by the German Space Operations Centre (GSOC) (Source:\nASTRIUM).\n\nHandbook of Space Technology Edited by Wilfried Ley, Klaus Wittmann and Willi Hallmann\n\n\u00a9 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

They\ninclude the exploration of our planetary system (see\nFigure 1.3) as well as astronomy and basic research\nin physics. Observation of the Earth by satellites is\ncarried out for scientific, commercial and military\npurposes. Communication and navigation missions\nhave gained high commercial value. In technology\nmissions, new systems and components are tested.\nHuman space flight provides a unique environment\nfor research programs including, for instance, experi-\nments in reduced gravity. In addition, exploration of\nthe planetary system by astronauts is in preparation.\nThe importance of satellite missions for military or\ncivil security purposes is recognized by a growing\nnumber of nations including the member states of\nthe European Union.\n\nThe potential of space missions has been demons-\ntrated over the decade. For the scientific community\nnew fundamental knowledge was gained and new\nfields of research have been opened [1.3]. Space\ntelescopes have improved our knowledge of the Uni-\nverse because observation became possible in those\nareas of the electromagnetic spectrum which are not\nvisible from the ground due to atmospheric blocking.\nBy observing the Earth, satellites have also helped to\n\n1 Introduction\n\nreduce threats and hardship by supporting regional\nenvironmental protection and through disaster ma-\nnagement. Analysis of effects and identification of the\nrescue options after natural disasters as well as their\nprediction increasingly relies on the use of satellites.\nThe potential of space missions for these purposes has\nnot yet been fully exploited. In economic, commercial\nand transportation areas as well as for individuals, the\nuse of satellites is also gaining importance. The uti-\nlization of satellite communication and navigation\nhas already become an integral part of our society,\ngrowing even more important as the capacity and\nquality of satellite services continuously improve.\n\nThe fascination with space flight also stems from\nthe high visibility of the technical performance needed\nto develop a space system. Thus, in addition to the\ndirect utilization of space missions, innovation and\nspin-off products are linked to space flight.\n\nThe objective of this book is to provide insight into\nspace systems and the related methods and processes\nfor their development, operation and utilization.\nBased on practical experience, the state of space flight\ntechnology should become apparent. The book also\nprovides an overview of the subsystems typically\nconstituting a space system. In addition the book tho-\nroughly describes the integration of those subsystems\ninto the complete space system. By describing the state\nof the art, this book also indicates the basis for the\ndevelopment of new concepts and ideas.\n\nStimulated by the implementation of large space\nprojects such as Galileo, an increase in space activities\nin Europe can be observed. With new applications and\nincreasing integration of the technical fields involved,\na vast development potential for companies has been\ngenerated. Academic institutions such as universities\nare increasingly able to conduct their own satellite\nmissions in order to train their students and to ex-\nploit the potential of new technologies. Together with\ncommercial and public space flight activities, this is\nproviding an inspiring and attractive environment\nfor young engineers.\n\nDespite the fascination with space flight, well-\ntrained space technology-oriented engineers are\nlacking in many European countries. Thus, the ed-\nucation programs in space technology need to be\noptimized and broadened in order to attract more\nyoung people.\n\n2/24/09 10:13:03 AM\n",

Only a rocket is able to overcome Earth\u2019s\ngravity and travel upward into air-free space. This\nwas not always obvious, as a quote from Max Valier\n(1895-1930) indicates:\n\nJust one year ago the problem of rocket propulsion\nwas considered a fairy tale and everyone who fought\nfor it with conviction was derided as a dreamer and\nlaughed at. However, today after the first successful\nruns of a rocket-propelled vehicle the public is\nbecoming impatient since there is no progress in\nthe advance into space.\n\nBadische Zeitung, Karlsruhe, 1929\n\nHermann Ganswindt (1856-1934), born in Seeburg,\nEast Prussia, may have been one of the first who was\nconvinced about the technical realism of a spacecraft\nand presented an elaborate construction scheme. He\nmade his first public presentation on May 27, 1891 in\nthe Berlin Philharmonie about his idea of a \u201cworld-\ncraft\u201d and explained how space flight might be realized\nby means of the propulsion principle.\n\nIn the twentieth century these visions became rea-\nlity. Space flight pioneers created the theoretical basis\nand took the first practical steps. While Konstantin E.\nTsiolkovsky (1857-1935) is called the \u201cfather of cos-\nmonautics\u201d in Russia, the Americans refer to Robert\nH. Goddard (1882-1945) as the \u201cfather of rocket tech-\nnology.\u2019 Hermann Oberth (1894-1989) is considered\na \u201cpioneer of space flight\u201d in Europe, while Wernher\nvon Braun (1912-1977) as his ablest student surely\ndid a great deal of the pioneering work as well (see\nFigure 1.1.1). Not only were technicians excited by the\nidea of space flight, but also movie makers and artists.\nFritz Lang, director of the first space movie Lady in\nthe moon (premiered in 1928), introduced the launch\ncountdown, which is still customary today.\n\nBorn 1857 in Izhevskoye, Russia, Konstantin\nE. Tsiolkovsky presented his fundamental ideas for\nspace flight in \u201cThe conquest of space with propulsion\n\n2/24/09 10:13:06 AM\n",

Goddard published a book entitled About a\nmethod to reach greatest altitudes. In 1926 he laun-\nched the world\u2019s first successful liquid-fueled\nrocket (petrol-liquid oxygen). While commercially\navailable rockets were able to produce an emission\nvelocity of 300 m/s, he managed to produce an\nemission velocity of approximately 2400 m/s with\npetrol-liquid oxygen.\n\nHermann Oberth was born 1894 in Hermann-\nstadt, Siebenbiirgen. In his book of 1923, The rocket\ntowards the planet regions, he described his theory of\nrocket propulsion in a vacuum.\n\nCHO1.indd Sec1:5\n\nTechnical Data for the A4/V2\n\nHeight: 14.03 m\nDiameter: 1.68m\nTake-off mass: 12.8t\nMax. velocity: 5.760 km/h\n\nFlight time (fueled): 70s\n\nThrust: approx. 25 t at 2000 m/s\nexhaust velocity\n\nMax. altitude: 96 km\n\nRange: 330 km\n\nFigure 1.1.2: Overview of characteristics of A4/V2 rocket used in\nWorld War II. (Source: Bundesarchiv).\n\nThe creation of a rocket launch area in Berlin\n(1930), led by Rudolf Nebel (1894-1978), and the use\nof rockets with liquid fuel were important steps.\n\nThe foundation of modern space flight was laid\nin the years 1935 to 1955. As has been the case se-\nveral times in the past, technical development was\nstimulated by war, first by World War II, then by the\nCold War.\n\nMilitary developments in the Soviet Union led\nto the construction of a two-stage intercontinental\nvehicle to transport warheads. This development\nbecame known as the R7 or \u201cSemyorka.\u201d Its further\ndevelopment finally led to the reliable Soyuz rocket,\ntoday still Russia\u2019s only vehicle for human flights.\nThis launcher and the Progress spacecraft trace back\nto Sergey P. Korolyov.\n\nIn May 1945 Wernher von Braun and six colle-\nagues were taken into custody by the Americans. In\nFebruary 1946, 118 engineers and technicians from\nGermany were working in White Sands, New Mexico.\nAt the beginning von Braun developed the American\nmedium-range rocket Hermes C and its derivatives,\nthe Redstone and Jupiter prototypes. The foundation\nfor both Russian as well as American rocket develop-\nment was originally the German V2 rocket of World\nWar II (Figure 1.1.2). It has been forgotten today\nthat there were considerations in 1950 about using\nnuclear energy for rocket propulsion [1.1.5], [1.1.6],\n[1.1.7].

After more than 50 years of experience,\nspace flight is not questioned by anyone.\n\n1.1.2 The Development of Unmanned\nGerman and European Space\nFlight\n\nThis historic part of the book has been written from\na distinctly German perspective. However, some\naspects of the following paragraphs exemplify deve-\nlopmental steps in countries comparable to Germany\nor even have general implications on how space flight\ndeveloped.\n\nInitial steps in Germany were the first research\nprojects and experiments for space flight applications\nstarting as early as 1951, when the North German\nSociety for Space Flight was founded. This society\nlaunched two test rockets under allied oversight in\n1952. In 1954 a German \u201cAerospace Center\u201d was\nfounded [1.1.3].\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn 1962 a modest sum of DM 11 million was al-\nlocated for space flight activities. This was not due to\nthe \u201cSputnik shock\u201d of 1957, but due to the creation\nof ESRO (European Space Research Organization)\nand ELDO (European Launcher Development Orga-\nnization), which Germany joined in 1963. The most\nimportant research institutes were in Belgium and\nthe Netherlands.\n\nIn Germany a national space flight program was\nset up under the responsibility of an agency originally\ncalled the GFW (Society for Space Research). This\nagency was integrated into the DFVLR (German\nAerospace Research and Experiment Institute). At\nthe end of the 1980s this integration was reversed by\nthe founding of DARA (German Agency for Space\nAffairs) and in 1997 it was reintegrated as part of\nDLR (German Aerospace Centre). Important satellite\nmissions and human missions (Spacelab, D-1, D-2,\netc.) have been conducted as part of the national space\nprogram. The technical basis of space flight activities\nin the German aerospace industry was established in\nthe 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The resulting knowledge\non the component, subsystem and system levels ini-\ntially led to national satellite missions, contributions\nto launcher development and human missions. Today\nDLR institutes, partially in cooperation with industry,\ndevelop new sensors, technologies and operation con-\ncepts, and are integrated into execution tasks of both\nthe German and international programs.\n\nFrom 1981 on, the East German Institute for\nCosmos Research (IFK) that emerged from a number\nof institutes was also heavily occupied with the deve-\nlopment of space flight systems and components. In\n1992 the institute was merged with the newly formed\nDLR site at Berlin-Adlershof.\n\nIndependent planning and execution of space\nflight missions in Germany started in the late 1960s.\nBut especially with respect to launchers, Germany\ncontinued to be dependent on the availability of Ame-\nrican types. Many of the satellite missions conducted\nwere joint projects in which Germany was able to\nestablish itself as a competent partner.\n\nImportant milestones in unmanned space flight\nwere the missions shown in Figures 1.1.4\u2014-1.1.17.\n\nAs early as 1962 the development of a launcher\nsystem (EUROPE rocket) commenced on a Euro-\npean level with the objective of creating a European\n\n2/24/09 10:13:09 AM\n\n\u00ae\n",

Since then\nmany highly complex projects have been prepared\nand conducted under ESA's responsibility. In that\nprogram a large number of German contributions\nwere involved.

This is being ac-\ncomplished by the ATV (Figure 1.1.23), according to\nthe same principle as for the Russian Progress space\ntransporter. In summer 2004 production of six such\nESA transporters was initiated under a contract with\nEADS Space Transportation. The contract lasts until\n2013. The ATV comprises three main elements: a\npropulsion system, a control unit with an on-board\ncomputer, and the payload. Its task is to keep the ISS\nalive and to supply materials (food/water, oxygen, fuel,\nexperimental equipment, etc.). Its technical data is as\nfollows: overall length, 10.3 m; diameter, 4.48 m; max.\ntake-off mass, 20.75 t; payload, 7.6 t; mission duration,\nmax. six months docked to ISS; power supply, four\nsolar panels and eight rechargeable batteries.\n\nCHO1.indd Sect:15\n\n15\n\nFigure 1.1.24: The Columbus module attached to the ISS (Source:\nESA).\n\nThe Columbus program was initiated in 1986 at\nan EU Council of Ministers conference to be imple-\nmented by ESA in addition to the Hermes and Ariane\n5 programs. Columbus (Figure 1.1.24) was originally\nmeant to be a laboratory docked to the US Space Sta-\ntion Freedom (SSF) or a free-flying device. The name\nColumbus was chosen because the discovery of Ame-\nrica by Columbus had its 500th anniversary in 1992.\nThus hope was expressed that Columbus would dock\nwith the SSF in 1992. However, Columbus was initially\nalso intended to be able to be launched by an Ariane\n5. The launch of Columbus and docking with the ISS\nbecame a reality in 2008.

The design of the\nsystem segments and consideration of their mutual\ndependencies is the central challenge for successfully\npreparing and conducting space flight missions.\nThe space segment comprises the spacecraft and\nits payload in orbit. The transfer segment provides\nthe transport of the spacecraft and its payload into\nspace by a launcher (typically a rocket). In order to\ncontrol and monitor the spacecraft and its payload\nas well as to distribute and process the payload data,\na ground segment is required. The design of ground\nand transfer segments and the costs connected with\ntheir realization are mainly influenced by the physical\n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1.2.1: The three segments comprising a space system: the\nspace segment with the space vehicle (top), the transfer segment\nwith the launcher (center) and the ground segment with control\ncenter and ground station (bottom) (Source: ESA/DLR).\n\nparameters of the spacecraft and the payload. In turn,\nthese depend essentially on the mission objective and\nthe mission duration. The three system segments can\nbe split up further into so-called system elements\n(Figure 1.2.2).\n\n2/24/09 10:14:19 AM\n",

Successful payload\noperations open the door to mission success or put it\nin doubt, even if all other subsystems of a spacecraft\nwork flawlessly. The payload\u2019s proximity to the appli-\ncation and therefore to the actual motivation for the\nmission justify an extraordinary position for it within\nthe whole system design process (Table 1.2.1).\n\nThe payload with its characteristic parameters\nof mass, geometry, power and communication\nrequirements determines the properties of the car-\nrying satellite platform, which is often referred to\nas the satellite bus. In human space flight there is\n\nCHO1.indd Sect:17\n\n17\n\nthe additional task of providing life support for the\ncrew.\n\nSystem Element: Orbit\n\nThis system element is essential for conceptualizing a\nspace flight system. The orbit of a spacecraft is defined\nby the mission objective. More than 95% of all space\nmission orbits are orbits around the Earth. Low Earth\norbits between 300 and 1500 km are often used, for\nexample, for Earth observation satellites and human\nspace flight, and the so-called geostationary orbit at\napprox. 36 000 km altitude for communications sat-\nellites (Figure 1.2.3). Orbits at intermediate altitudes,\nsuch as so-called medium Earth orbits (MEOs), are\nused for instance for navigation satellites (GPS, Ga-\nlileo). The relatively small number of interplanetary\nmissions on which spacecraft are sent beyond an Earth\norbit into planetary orbits are often characterized by\nseveral years of flight time until the spacecraft reach\ntheir target object or orbit (see Table 1.2.2). With the\nexception of the Apollo missions to the Moon, which\nwere concluded in 1972, planetary missions are still\nlimited to unmanned endeavors.\n\nUnmanned spacecraft flying in Earth orbit are\nreferred to as satellites. When flying in orbits beyond\nEarth\u2019s orbit they are termed space probes. Space-\ncraft carrying humans are referred to according to\ntheir functions as space shuttles, space ships or space\nstations. Objects with ballistic trajectories which\ncan reach altitudes in excess of 1000 km are called\nsuborbital rockets or sounding rockets. They are not\ndiscussed in this book.\n\nSystem Element: Spacecraft\n\nWith ever-expanding areas of application, spacecraft\nhave evolved in their development over more than 50\nyears into a huge variety of types with a wide range\nof characteristics. However, in order to work proper-\nly the spacecraft has to perform an invariable set of\nfunctions. The corresponding functional structure\nof subsystems represents the common basis for de-\nsign, production and operation of all spacecraft. In\nparticular, the complexity of subsystems has drama-\ntically increased over the decades. Nevertheless, the\nfunctional logic of each subsystem as well as aspects\nof its compatibility have not changed significantly.\nThe following spacecraft subsystems are generally\ndistinguished (see also Figure 1.2.4).\n\n2/24/09 10:14:44 AM\n",

Only by systematic\ndesign that focuses on the interaction between space\nand ground segments, corresponding adaptations on\nthe spacecraft system and subsystem levels, and the\npayload can an optimized space mission be realized.\n\n1.2.1.2 Transfer Segment\n\nAnother system segment in space missions involves\nthe launcher that transports the spacecraft into space.\nNumerous rockets have become available on the\ncommercial market over the years. With the Ariane\n5 rocket Europe has a powerful and internationally\ncompetitive product at its disposal.\n\nSignificant factors in choosing a specific laun-\ncher are the orbit to be reached as well as the mass\nand dimensions of the spacecraft. Due to the high\ndevelopment and modification costs of rockets, the\nvariety of relevant types for a mission profile is often\nvery limited. This also means that the rocket offers\nfewer variables for mission optimization than do the\nspacecraft and the ground segment. However, multiple\nlaunches of several spacecraft at the same time and\nadditional boost stages on the spacecraft to reach\ncertain orbits offer some additional flexibility. It is also\npossible for one or more small satellites to be launched\n\u201cpiggyback\u201d together with the main payload.\n\nFor spacecraft with a mass under 2 t and LEOs\nthere are a large number of launchers available. At\npresent these are built and launched also by develop-\ning countries, such as Brazil or India. On the other\nhand, there are only a few models available at the\nupper end of the scale. Satellites with a mass of more\nthan 8 tcan only be launched into geostationary orbit\nby the Ariane 5 ECA as well as by the US Atlas V and\nDelta IV rockets. For extreme launch masses in the\narea of 25 t into LEO there is only the Space Shuttle\navailable.

Similar to the spacecraft, the groun\nsegment also provides a large set of degrees of freedom\nin the design with a high potential of optimization\nwith regard to efficiency. In contrast to the spacecraft,\nconsiderable changes can still be applied to the groun\nsegment after launch. These changes can sometimes\nbe quite extensive and often decide the success of a\nmission. Mostly, however, late changes translate into\nsignificant additional work and costs.\n\nThe ground segment can be divided into two\nsystem elements: mission operations and the ground\n\nstation network.\n\nSystem Element: Mission Operations\nFor the most part, mission operations are designed\nand conducted at a control center. With this system\nthe spacecraft is monitored and controlled and the\ndata traffic organized. In addition, the control center\ncontains all necessary interfaces to the spacecraft\nmanufacturer as well as to its users. The control center\nroutes all relevant data to them.\n\nThe central part of mission operations is flight\noperations, which are conducted from a control room\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50 I\nol 1 L L | L fm |\nD oD oD oD oD oD oD\nx x x x x x x\noO fo} Oo fo} fo} Oo fo}\n- oO So ro} ro} So fo}\nv 5 \u20ac 8 FB 8B\n\u00a2 s g\u00a7 \u00a7 g &\n2 3 3 3\n8 8 &\u00a7\n\nFigure 1.2.5: Number of operating satellites according to their\nlaunch mass (fueled).\n\n2/24/09 10:14:46 AM\n",

Flight operations activities include the\nmanagement of the actual flight tasks and the mainte-\nnance of the spacecraft in all mission phases in order\nto use it optimally and as long as possible. Operation\nspecialists for the subsystems are organized in a flight\nteam. Under the lead of a responsible system engineer\nand by means of telemetry from the space segment,\ntheir analyses include considering the status and\ntrends in the mission, working through procedures,\ngenerating command sequences and conducting flight\nmaneuvers. Mission management is carried out from\nor in close coordination with flight operations.\n\nOperations activities vary profoundly with the\ndifferent phases of preparation and execution of a\nmission. The most intense phase of mission operations\nis the so-called launch and early operation phase\n(LEOP), in which the spacecraft is activated after\ninjection and its survival secured under the extreme\nconditions of space with respect to temperature,\nvacuum, radiation, etc. Compared to the following\nphases of in-orbit testing (IOT) and especially routine\noperations, this flight phase is by far the most deman-\nding in terms of personnel and resources.\n\nFlight operations use the ground data proces-\nsing facilities and equipment at the control center.\nThese facilities assure the correct configuration and\navailability of all telemetry data required for opera-\ntions. Additional contributions to flight operations\nare made by the flight dynamics group and by mission\nplanning. The former is especially responsible for orbit\n\nFigure 1.2.6: Control room of the Columbus control center as part\nof the flight operations at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen.

The latter provides the tools necessary\nto generate and handle timelines, schedules, etc.,\nand considers user priorities as well as physical and\ntechnical constraints. Ground data processing, flight\ndynamics and mission planning are highly interlinked\nwith flight operations and coordinated by the mission\nmanagement. In complex missions the aim is to grant\nall mission participants easy access to relevant data,\ninformation and products on electronic platforms.\nIncreasingly, close cooperation between so-cal-\nled user ground centers and mission operations is\nrequired. In commercial Earth observation missions\nthese centers take care of tasks such as processing raw\nuser data into finished information products. Data\nrefining, thematic editing and archiving are some of\nthe relevant aspects. Sometimes necessary payload\nactivities, including instrument calibration and con-\nfiguration changes, are also prepared. Other services\ninclude interface adaptations for routine operations.\n\nSystem Element Ground Station Network\n\nThe antennas (Figure 1.2.7) located at ground stations\nare the most visible element of the transmission path\nfrom and to the spacecraft. Various frequency bands\ncan be used whose allocation is subjected to inter-\nnational coordination. Ground stations receive the\ndata for spacecraft control from an associated control\ncenter. On the other side, status and user data from the\nspacecraft are routed to the control center from the\nground station. In addition, a ground station provides\norbit determination (tracking) data.\n\nThe mission profile of a ground station is also\nhighly dependent on the mission phase. During mis-\nsion preparation, compatibility with communication\ncomponents of the spacecraft and configuration of\nata interfaces have a high priority. With separation\nfrom the launcher and the beginning of the LEOP,\netection of spacecraft position as well as frequent and\nlong-lasting contacts with the spacecraft are especially\nimportant.

Moreover, the standard publi-\ncations [1.2.2] to [1.2.6] describe relevant methods\nof systems engineering.\n\nThe mission objective determines the mission.\nThus the description of the payload often stands at\nthe beginning of the full system description. During\npayload design, quantitative properties of the payload,\nsuch as optical resolution (Earth observation), trans-\nmission capacity (communications) or signal accuracy\n(navigation) are the center of attention. However,\nlifetime as well as the interaction of components\nand operational manageability are also important\naspects. Depending on the payload requirements,\ncharacteristic parameters (mass, volume, energy de-\nmand, communication demand, etc.) are estimated\nand further requirements for the spacecraft and its\norbit (pointing accuracy, ground track and times,\nmeasurement geometry) are determined.\n\nThe system engineer often works initially in a\nso-called top-down design approach within the hi-\nerarchical structure of a system (Figure 1.2.11) on\nthe concepts for the upper levels (beginning with the\nsystem elements). In the course of the design process\nmore details become clarified and the lower system\nlevels are defined.\n\nUsing mission objectives and payload characteris-\ntics it is possible to define an optimum orbit applying\nan adequate mission analysis.

Despite the\npotential to create optimal solutions in the orbit\nselection process, further options are helpful, as rea-\nsons might emerge during the actual system design\nfor choosing a nonoptimal orbit. Typical examples of\nsuch reasons are ground station availability or aspects\nof the spacecraft\u2019s energy supply.\n\nWhen visions concerning payload and orbit lay-\nout have converged, one can start by describing the\nspacecraft. At first the spacecraft can be described\nby defining subsystem requirements. A first set of\ncharacteristic parameters for the spacecraft and orbit\ncan be defined.\n\nKnowing these characteristic spacecraft data\n(volume, mass, etc.) and orbit (propulsion demand,\nlocation of launch place, etc.) a first selection of an\nappropriate launcher becomes possible. At the same\ntime spacecraft (communication demand, degree of\nautonomy, etc.) and orbit (antenna visibility) parame-\nters are used to design the ground segment.\n\nThis initial rough knowledge of payload, orbit\nand spacecraft permits the determination of a sui-\ntable launcher and the design of the ground segment,\nresulting in a preliminary mission concept for the\nspace system.\n\nThe first mission concept also enables a rough\ncheck of superior mission constraints to be made, such\nas costs and technical feasibility. This presupposes a\npreliminary understanding of the properties and costs\nof the potential system segments including spacecraft,\nlauncher and ground segment.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nAfter the first estimation of feasibility and costs\nthe mission concept is revised. If a stable mission con-\ncept (or several apparently equal mission concepts)\nis obtained after a number of iterations, the mission\narchitecture can be built up by developing the sub-\nsystem design from the subsystem requirements. This\nenables detailed cost and feasibility analyses. This basis\nis often followed by further iterations of the mission\narchitecture until a number of stable alternatives are\ndefined. Within a system analysis the favored alterna-\ntive is chosen for subsequent realization.\n\nThe two essential conditions for the design to\nconverge into an optimized complete system are\ntransparency of the design process and completeness\nof the system and subsystem aspects. Today, both\nconditions can be supported by the new methods\nand tools of concurrent engineering, especially for\ncomplex missions. Specialists in all relevant domains\nwork on the design process simultaneously, which\nincreases efficiency. Only a clear solution which\nincludes the ground segment and launcher and all\ntheir critical aspects can confirm the feasibility of a\nmission. For the launcher, primarily the orbit to be\nreached, the mass and volume of the spacecraft and\nits availability, reliability and costs are of outstanding\nimportance.\n\nFollowing the determination of the mission archi-\ntecture, which is the subject of a Phase A study, typi-\ncally a Phase B study or definition study is conducted\nin order to define the components and individual\nparts of all subsystems. This is followed by the final\ncost and feasibility analysis. Design, construction,\nintegration, test and qualification are combined in\nPhase C/D, which is followed by operations (Phase\nE) and, finally, secure shutdown and disposal of the\nspace flight system.\n\nIn creating a mission concept, useful experience\ncan be formulated as the following rules of thumb:\n\n1. The feasibility of a mission is often dependent on\nthe compatibility of a mission with a financial\nbudget. Ground segment costs and the range of\noperation tasks are dominated by the required\ninfrastructure. The cost of the transfer segment\nis primarily dominated by spacecraft mass and\ngeometry as well as propulsion demand.

In\nall domains experience (available operation pro-\ncesses, experience with launchers, serial produc-\ntion of satellites and payloads) results in distinct\ncost reductions.\n\n2. The mass of the spacecraft platform is three to\nten times the mass of the payload. For large com-\nmunications satellites this mass ratio is often be-\ntween three and five. On planetary and in earlier\nmissions the mass ratio favored the platform even\nmore.\n\n3. The mass of the satellite subsystems is dominated\nby the power supply and the structure. Together\nboth mass subsystems comprise between one-third\nand one-half of a spacecraft\u2019s dry mass. Propulsion\nand attitude control are next with regard to the\nproportion of mass.\n\n4. The operation effort varies strongly over the life-\ntime of a mission. The greatest effort is required\nduring the few days of the launch and early opera-\ntion phase during which the subsystems are ad-\njusted to the extreme environmental conditions of\nspace after ascent and separation from the launcher.\nAfter stabilizing the spacecraft\u2019s condition there is a\ncommissioning and test phase during which atten-\ntion is mostly on the configuration of the payload.\nIn this phase the operation effort is still rather high\ncompared to the subsequent routine operations\nphase. In this phase, sometimes lasting several\nyears, only a fraction of the initial operations crew\nof the first two phases is required, especially if\noperation takes place in a so-called multimission\nenvironment, in which several spacecraft are con-\ntrolled simultaneously. With increasing mission\nduration the operation effort also increases again\nafter a few years as components and subsystems\nsubject to deterioration fail. Typically, attitude\ncontrol and power are affected most seriously.\nIn general, the number of unpredictable failures\nincreases with lifetime, which can lead to the de-\nstabilization of the entire spacecraft.

There are nine\ncharacteristic areas of application for space flight\nmissions, as follows.\n\n1.2.3.1 Earth Observation\n\nEarth observation missions are conducted with\nsmall as well as medium and large satellites. Earth\nobservation comprises data acquisition with cameras\nand sensors which work at different wavelengths over\ninfrared, visible and ultraviolet ranges. Both passive\noptical observation techniques and active sampling\n(radar) are used. Moreover, a variety of different\nmeasuring methods are applied to determine the\nelectric, magnetic, optic or gravimetric properties\nof the Earth and its atmosphere. Orbits for Earth\nobservation are often rather low (< 1000 km) and\nhave a high inclination in order to be able to observe\nthe Earth with high resolution and from pole to pole.\nSometimes a target is to be imaged at a certain time\nof the day (to achieve equivalent shadowing condi-\ntions). That requires a rotation of the orbital plane\nof approx. 1\u00b0 around the Earth\u2019s axis every day (Sun-\nsynchronous orbit). This rotation can be generated by\nan orbit disturbance caused by the Earth\u2019s oblateness.\nIt requires that the orbit is not exactly above the poles,\nbut slightly inclined (as in the TerraSAR-X mission).\nIn case the target is to be reanalyzed under the same\nobservation angle, the satellite has to be brought\nonto the original track after a few orbits (repeat\nground track).\n\n1.2.3.2 Weather Observation\n\nA special case of Earth observation is weather obser-\nvation. Since the beginning of space flight missions\nweather observation has been a continuously expan-\nding area of application with numerous satellites in\nlow as well as geostationary orbits. Central aspects\nare the local, regional and global analysis of weather\nconditions, the generation of data as input for\nweather forecast models, and the characterization\nof the atmosphere regarding properties and changes\nin regional and global climate. Imaging instruments\nare often used on the satellites. Commercial user\nscenarios in weather observation are also gaining in\nimportance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nExample\n\nMetOp-A: European weather satellite\n(Figure 1.2.13)\n\nLaunch: October 2006\n\nMass: 4093 kg\n\nAltitude: 820 km\n\nInclination: 99\u00b0\n\nLaunch site: Baikonur\n\nPayload:\n\nFigure 1.2.13: The European MetOp-A satellite is in a Sun-synchronous\nLEO.

The\nrequired electrical power and the typical propulsion\nrequirements for the positioning of these satellites in\ngeostationary orbit lead to great dimensions and seve-\nral tonnes of total mass. These satellites are launched\ninto a so-called geostationary transfer orbit (perigee\napprox. 500 km, apogee approx. 36 000 km) by the\nmost powerful launchers available. The adaptation of\nthis orbit into the final geostationary orbit occurs by\nso-called apogee boost maneuvers with the satellite\u2019s\nmain engine in the first few days of the mission. Due\nto the large number of satellites in geostationary orbit\nwith its subdivision into discrete control boxes, the\ndemand on flight dynamics is continuously high. The\ndensity caused by having hundreds of communica-\ntions satellites located in this orbital region makes it\nnecessary to put the satellite into a so-called graveyard\norbit some hundreds of kilometers beyond at the end\nof its service life (nominally about 15 years).

Special challenges of interplanetary\nspace flight are significant signal latency (up to hours\nin the outer Solar System), long flight time, and navi-\ngation.

These interfaces will be thoroughly\ncovered in Chapters 3 through 7.\n\nThis section describes the interfaces of a space\nsystem with its environment and the laws describing\nthe motion of a spacecraft.\n\nA spacecraft is exposed to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nuntil it reaches the environment of space after launch.\nThe conditions on the ground are familiar to us. Thus,\nwe will not give here any details of atmospheric condi-\ntions on the ground, although they have some influence,\nfor example as cleanliness conditions during integrati-\non of a spacecraft or as weather conditions at launch.\n\nThe space environment, especially the influence\nof the Sun and the Earth, is characterized by:\n\ne High-energy electromagnetic radiation\n\ne Particle radiation\n\ne Vacuum\n\ne Low temperature of the space background\ne Reduced gravity\n\ne Residual atmosphere (in low orbits).\n\nAn overview of the characteristics of the space en-\nvironment and their effects on a spacecraft and its\npayload is given in Section 2.1.\n\nThe motion of a spacecraft is governed by the\nlaws of orbit dynamics. Section 2.2 describes the me-\nthods of orbit determination and prediction. Typical\norbit maneuvers of the spacecraft as well as orbit\nperturbations are discussed. Characteristic orbits for\n\ntypical mission profiles are presented. The relatively\ncomplex mathematical elaboration of the governing\nlaws cannot be provided within the scope of this book.\nHowever, the mathematical formulas which are used\nin practical applications are given and the methods\nto apply them are described.\n\nWhen a spacecraft returns to Earth the influence\nof the atmosphere gains in importance. Section 2.3\ncovers the field of aerothermodynamics, which is\nrelevant for this phase of a space mission, especially\nas to the design of a return vehicle.\n\nSection 2.4 returns to the space environment in\norder to present one specific aspect, namely microme-\nteorites (natural causes) and space debris (objects and\nparticles introduced by space flight activities), which\nrepresent a hazard for spacecraft. Thus, Section 2.4\ncharacterizes the micrometeorite and space debris envi-\nronment and gives an overview of the models employed\nto quantify the risks.

The neutral\ngases in this layer are separated by the Earth\u2019s gravi-\nty in such a way that the percentage of lightweight\ngases increases with altitude, while the percentage of\nheavyweight gases decreases. Eventually, the density\nof the gases is so low that single particles (molecules)\ncan move in Keplerian orbits without colliding with\neach other. Particles which have a higher than orbital\nvelocity can escape into interplanetary space. This\nregion, beginning at a height between 500 and 600 km,\nis called the exosphere. Only neutral gas particles can\nleave the gravity field of the Earth, however. Ionized\nparticle behave completely differently.\n\nThere are two classification systems for ionized\nparticles in the atmosphere. One is based on the con-\ncentration of electrons as a function of altitude; the\nother is based on the influence of the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield on the ionized components of the air.\n\nCharged particles that move across the magnetic\nfield are influenced by a force perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field and to their velocity. Due to their smal-\nler mass electrons are more influenced by this force\nthan are ions traveling at the same velocity. The pro-\nportion of ionized particles increases with height. Up\nto an altitude of 70 km the share of ionized particles is\nso small that the neutral gas particles take the ionized\ngas particles with them. Above there is a region where\nthe ions completely follow the movement of the neut-\nral gas particles, while the electrons are hindered in\ntheir movement across the magnetic field. As a result,\nelectric fields are generated (dynamo layer).\n\nThe density of the neutral gas decreases above a\nheight of 130 km, which makes collisions between ions\nand neutral gas particles very rare. The motion of all io-\nnized particles is mainly driven by the Earth\u2019s magnetic\n\nfield. This region is called the magnetosphere. Charged\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nparticles can hardly leave this region because they are\nguided along the magnetic field lines they interact with.\nAt the poles they are reflected back and forth and there-\nfore held captive in the magnetic field lines they travel\nalong. This phenomenon creates the hot, thin plasma\nwhich fills the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere\nitself is circumferentially flooded with the cold, dense\nplasma of the solar wind traveling at supersonic velo-\ncity. The solar wind is not able to penetrate the outer\nborder of the magnetosphere, called the magnetopause,\ndue to the Earth\u2019s strong magnetic field. It is forced\nto reduce its velocity at the so-called bow shock to a\nsubsonic value and to stream around the magnetos-\nphere. At this point, the solar wind with its high kinetic\npressure compresses the magnetosphere on the day side\nof the Earth. By contrast, the magnetosphere on the\nnight side of the Earth is formed into a tail extending\nbeyond the orbit of the Moon.\n\nHow electron density varies with altitude is a\nconsequence of the superposition of several single\nlayers. Its origin [2.1.3] is explained qualitatively in\nFigure 2.1.6.\n\nThe density of the ionizable gas decreases with\nincreasing height in the gravity field of the Earth.\nThe intensity of the ionizable radiation, however, is\nhighest at the top. As radiation is absorbed and used\nfor ionization, the radiation intensity decreases in the\ndownward direction. The production rate of ions is\nproportional to the quantities mentioned above and\ntherefore has a strong maximum at medium altitudes.\nBecause different gases exist within the air, different\nionization layers of gas are created at different heights.\n\nAltitude 4\n\n/ Intensity of\n/ ionizing\n/ radiation\n\nRate of\nionization\n\nDensity of the\nionizable gas\n\n>\n\nFigure 2.1.6: Creation of an ionospheric layer (schematic).\n\n2/25/09 11:02:59 AM\n",

Based on\nwhat is known today, this is not the case. The magnetic\nfield of the Earth is embedded in the particle stream\nof the Sun, called the solar wind. At the same time it\noverlaps with the interplanetary magnetic field. This\ninteraction limits the magnetic field to a finite volume\ncalled the magnetosphere (see Figure 2.1.8).\n\nOn its side facing the Sun the magnetosphere is\nelliptical with the geocentric distance of the subsolar\nspot being 10 times the radius of the Earth (around\n64 000 km).\n\nFluctuations of this distance up to several Earth\nradii can be observed. This variation depends on the\nphysical properties of the interplanetary media and\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:41\n\n4l\n\nMagnetopause\n\nwe Magnetospheric\nSolar wind \u2014 tail\n\n77 Lunar orbit\n(60 Re)\nFigure 2.1.8: Outer limits of the magnetosphere.\n\nespecially on the pressure of the solar wind.

Usually,\nit significantly exceeds the lunar orbit (60 times the\nradius of the Earth) and its radius increases with the\ndistance from the Earth, reaching values between 25\nand 30 Rg at a distance of 200 Ro.\n\n2.1.3.3 Movement of Charged Particles within\nthe Magnetosphere\n\nMost particles populating the magnetosphere are\nionized and therefore charged. Additional forces act\non these charged particles moving inside the magnetic\nfield. They are a function of the velocity of the charged\nparticle. To describe this effect a balance of forces on\na single particle is assumed. In this very simple model\nthe following forces are taken into account: the inertial\nforce F;, the velocity-dependent magnetic field force\nF,, and other external forces that are independent of\nvelocity F;. Friction forces and the repercussion on\nthe magnetic field of the movement of the particles\nare not taken into account. The magnetic field is as-\nsumed to be a dipole. In this scenario we are looking\nfor solutions of the differential equation\n\ndy _\n\ndt\n\nm Fy, +q (vx B) (2.1.7)\nwhere:\n\nm = the mass of the particle,\n\nt= time,\n\nq= charge,\n\n2/25/09 11:02:59 AM\n",

Therefore, it is helpful to break\ndown the total movement into single components. In\nfact, this is often possible since these different single\ncomponents are on different time scales and can\ntherefore be treated independently. As a result, the\nfollowing special cases occur, among others:\n\n(1) Fovertical = 95 B= homogeneous \u2014 gyration\n(2) Fev ertical = 9\u00bb B gradient \u2014 oscillation\n(3) Fevertical = 9\u00bb B gradient perpendicular to\nB> drift\n(4) Fey crtical # 0B = homogeneous \u2014 drift.\n\nA magnetic field perpendicular to the movement of\nthe particles in response to gravity causes the charged\nparticles to gyrate along the magnetic field lines. The\nmagnetic field becomes stronger as it approaches the\npoles. Because the charged particles are forced out\nof an inhomogeneous magnetic field a magnetic\n\u201cbottle\u201d is created that traps the particles and reflects\nthem from pole to pole (Figure 2.1.9).\n\nThe particles oscillate from one magnetic pole to\nthe other and penetrate the atmosphere down to a\nheight that is directly proportional to the strength of\nthe magnetic field. Furthermore, there is an additional\nazimuthal drift of the charged magnetic particles due\nto the bending of the magnetic field lines. With this\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nmodel of dipole approximation the reflecting points\nof all particle tracks move in circles of the same height.\nIn reality the heights of the reflecting points fluctu-\nate according to the local field strength. Particularly\nwell known in this context is the so-called South\nAtlantic anomaly with its magnetic field strengths\nbeing significantly weak. With this anomaly, charged\nparticles are able to penetrate extremely deep into\nthe atmosphere.\n\n2.1.3.4 The Radiation Belt (Van Allen Belt)\n\nThe highly energetic particle population of a radiation\nbelt enclosed in the inner magnetosphere is a potential\ndanger for spacecraft. High-energy particles are able\nto ionize especially electronic parts and therefore\ndamage them. Such ionization, for example in an\nelectronic semiconductor, is often reversible at first,\nbut typically creates additional charge carriers leading\nto at least a temporary malfunction of the electronic\nsemiconductor.

For 4 MeV particles the maximum in the\n(magnetic) equatorial plane is at about L = 1.8 (at\napproximately 5000 km altitude), for 50 MeV parti-\ncles it is at 3000 km (the inner radiation belt).

On\nthe other hand, mission and spacecraft designers try to\nbenefit as much as possible from particular features of\nthe space environment in terms of cost, energy, propel-\nlant, etc. This is why, compared to other environments,\nthe space environment has such a huge impact on the\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:43\n\n43\n\ndesign of a technical device. Disregarding some very\nparticular conditions, the space environment can be\ndescribed using the following categories:\n\ne Gravitational fields\n\ne Magnetic fields\n\ne Electromagnetic radiation\n\ne Atmospheres\n\ne Energetic particle radiation\n\ne High vacuum and plasma\n\ne Contamination\n\ne Rigid body interaction.\n\nThese conditions have to be evaluated and checked\nearly in the design phase for their impact on the\nmission, because they contribute fundamentally to\nwhat decisions are made concerning orbit definition,\nmass budget, thermal control systems, and selection of\ncomponents and materials. With the comprehensive\nexperience collected since the beginning of the \u201cspace\nage,\u201d spacecraft designers can refer to a number of\napproved methods, models and data.\n\n2.1.4.1 Gravity and Magnetism\n\nThe motion of a spacecraft exposed to the space en-\nvironment is mainly determined by gravity.

Spacecraft having less strict requirements for\nattitude accuracy (> 1\u00b0) can actually make use of\nthis natural effect for passive attitude control [2.1.6].\nConversely, active attitude control systems have to\naccount for this effect.\n\nThe law of gravitation in its simple form is appli-\ncable only for orbits close to the central body where\nthe influence of other celestial bodies on spacecraft\nmotion is negligible. If this influence increases (e.g.,\nfor vehicles in geostationary orbits), a multibody pro-\nblem has to be solved for orbit determination. Because\nof the mathematical complexity of these multibody\nsystems they will not be discussed here; the reader is\nreferred to publications dedicated to this topic.\n\nMore accurate orbit calculations which account\nfor the deviation from the ideal spherical shape of\ncentral bodies require an exact model of their gra-\nvitational field. Meanwhile, a number of models of\nthe Earth\u2019s gravitational potential have been derived\nusing various methods, for example satellite tracking,\nEarth surface height measurements and surface-based\ngravity measurements. The basic principle of these\nmethods is an infinite series of Legendre polynomials\nin latitudinal and longitudinal directions which solve\nLaplace\u2019s differential equation for a gravitational\npotential Uin empty space: V\u2019U = 0.\n\nThe complete expression is given in the following\nformula:\n\nGM et \u2018\"\nU(r, @ A) = [16 >y >(*) + Pam\n\nn=2 m=0\n: [Com cos(m A)+ Sy\u00bb, sin (m d)| sing\n\n(2.1.12)\nwhere:\n\na = reference axis of the ellipsoid,\n\nn, m= degree and order of the harmonic terms,\nA, p= geographical longitude and latitude,\nCan Sam = Spherical, harmonic coefficients,\n\nP,,,, = Legendre polynomial of the first order.\n\nFor example, the harmonic terms for m= 0 and n=2\ndescribe the Earth\u2019s polar flattening.\n\nNowadays numerical models of the Earth\u2019s gravi-\ntational potential are known to the degree and order\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nof 70 and allow for an accuracy of orbit determination\nwithin a few centimeters. ESA\u2019s standard model current-\nly in use is the JGM-2 (Joint Gravity Model 2) [2.1.7].\nThe models are steadily being improved, among other\nmethods by satellite-based remote sensing measure-\nments of the geoid (e.g., CHAMP, GRACE).\n\nThe increasingly detailed knowledge of gravitatio-\nnal fields in conjunction with high-power computing\nfacilitates allow the use of gravitational fields for\ndifficult orbital maneuvers, especially during interpla-\nnetary missions. Some sophisticated mission scenarios\nbecome feasible only with the gravitational help of one\nor more celestial bodies which can accelerate or decele-\nrate a spacecraft during so-called fly-by maneuvers (i.e.,\nflying by a celestial body to use its gravitational force\nfor maneuvering). Fuel consumption can be reduced\nconsiderably using this approach. The most recent ex-\namples are the acceleration of the New Horizons Pluto\nprobe during a Jupiter fly-by as well as the deceleration\nof the comet-chaser Rosetta during a Mars fly-by.\n\nWithin the combined gravitational field of the\nSun and Earth as well as within all multibody systems\n\na finite number of points exist in space where all\nacting gravitational forces are balanced (potential-\nfree zones). These points are the so-called Lagrange\npoints. They can be occupied by spacecraft using\nthem as fixed observation points with respect to the\ntwo interacting celestial bodies. Referenced to the\nEarth\u2014Sun system, Lagrange point L] lies ona straight\nline crossing the centers of gravity of the Earth and\nSun, 1.5 million kilometers before the Earth as seen\nfrom the Sun. L2 and L3 are located on the same line\nbehind the Earth or beyond Earth\u2019s orbit 180\u00b0 away\nfrom Earth\u2019s position, respectively. L4 and L5 are\nfound on the Earth\u2019s track around the Sun at +60\u00b0\nangular distance from the Earth. L1, L2 and L3 are\nmetastable points whereas L4 and L5 are considered\nstable points. Spacecraft on Lagrange points follow\neither so-called halo orbits or Lissajous orbits around\nthese points and permanently have to be corrected\nfor orbital perturbations in order not to drift away.\nAs opposed to the elliptic halo orbit, the Lissajous\norbit requires fewer orbital correction maneuvers and\nthus also less fuel. It is not co-planar to the Earth-Sun\nplane but contains planar as well as vertical compo-\nnents.

The\nalmost complete absence of gravity on-board has ad-\nvantages but also implies special circumstances. One\nof the distinct advantages is the fact that mechanical\ndevices and mechanisms can be designed for relatively\nsmall static and dynamic loads. The highest structu-\nral loads to be encountered are those arising during\nlaunch and reentry. One drawback of weightlessness\non-board a spacecraft is the uncontrolled sloshing\nof liquids (e.g., propellants) inside the storage tanks.\nIn order to avoid extensive sloshing and to assure\nthe supply to the fuel pipes, the liquid has to be pre-\ntensioned. Pre-tensioning is achieved, for instance,\nin special tanks which make use of the liquid\u2019s own\nsurface stress, by using membranes or by spinning.\n\nMagnetism is a quite different physical pheno-\nmenon from gravitation. However, there are some\nsimilarities. The relevant magnetic fields for space\nflight are also bound to celestial objects. In contrast\nto gravitation, the origin of magnetic fields is related\nto magnetodynamical effects in the interior of the\ncelestial body and is not just related to the existence\nof the body itself. Due to their dynamic origin, ma-\ngnetic fields are not constant in their temporal or\nspatial dimensions, and, moreover, these fields are\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:45\n\n45\n\nperturbed by charged particles or by plasma like the\n\nsolar wind, which results altogether in more complex\n\nmathematical models.\n\nSimilar to the models of the geopotential there are\nalso magnetic models. For the Earth, however, several\nmodels are required, depending on the radial distance\nand due to the strong interaction with the solar wind:\ne Simple or eccentric dipole models, which may be\n\napplicable to LEO missions [2.1.8]. A standard\n\nreference model is the IGRF (International Geo-\n\nmagnetic Reference Field) model [2.1.9].\n\ne The interaction of the solar wind with the geo-\nmagnetic field results in the deformation of its\nperiphery: It is compressed in the direction of the\nSun and builds up a tail in the direction opposite\nto the Sun [2.1.10].\n\nWith respect to space flight and the design of a space-\ncraft, magnetic fields imply the following interactions\nand consequences:\n\ne The motion of a spacecraft within a magnetic field\nresults in induced electromagnetic forces. Inside\nthe spacecraft this may lead to electrical potentials\nin the range of several volts. Provided that the\nelectric circuit is closed, electric current is gene-\nrated inside the spacecraft and in the neighboring\nplasma. In so-called tethered satellite missions\nthis effect might be used to generate electrical\npower for on-board power supply.\n\ne In case a satellite has an internal magnetic mo-\nment, the external magnetic field exerts magnetic\nforces on the spacecraft. This effect may be used\nwith smaller satellites to perform attitude control\nalong the magnetic field.\n\ne Magnetic fields generate radiation belts and the ac-\nceleration of charged particles in the direction of the\nmagnetic poles causes certain orbits to be exposed to\nhigher levels of radiation (see Section 2.1.4.4).\n\nAccordingly, mission and spacecraft designers try to\navoid the detrimental effect of magnetic fields as far\nas possible, other than for specific missions.\n\n2.1.4.2 Electromagnetic Radiation\n\nElectromagnetic radiation approaches a spacecraft\nfrom all directions (omnidirectional) with oscillating\n\n2/25/09 11:03:03 AM\n",

However, the\nimpact on the operation of a spacecraft is mainly\ndominated by the electromagnetic radiation emitted\nby the Sun. The consequences of being exposed to this\nradiation are manifold and induce high demands on\nthe design process.\n\nThe influences of electromagnetic radiation on\na spacecraft in our Solar System can be categorized\nas follows.\n\nThermal Influence\nThe energy of the impacting electromagnetic radia-\ntion is mainly converted into thermal energy, which\nmakes it the most important external parameter for\nthe spacecraft\u2019s thermal balance. Relevant for the ther-\nmal balance are direct and reflected solar radiation, as\nwell as the radiation from the Earth and from other\ncelestial bodies (see Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3).\nTherefore, in the design phase a detailed ana-\nlysis of the chronological sequence of amplitudes,\nincident angles and wavelengths of the energy flux\nto be expected over the complete mission has to be\nperformed. The information gained is used to design\nthe thermal control system (TCS) of the spacecraft\n(see Section 4.3). Particularly challenging for the TCS\nare the extreme temperature gradients between the\nsides facing the Sun and those facing black space, or\nbetween Sun illumination phases and eclipses. Conse-\nquently, the linear expansion of the materials used is a\ncritical design parameter. Interstellar electromagnetic\nradiation sources are not relevant for the thermal\nbalance of a spacecraft. However, the temperature of\nthe cosmic background radiation (T= 2.7 K) plays\na major role in the design of specific science probes\n(IR telescopes) and their thermal balance since the\noperating temperature of their instruments is below\nthe temperature of the background radiation.\n\nChemical Influence\n\nWithin the Solar System, the densities of the energy\nflows of short-wave solar electromagnetic radiation\n(UV, X-ray) are high enough to cause a change in the\natomic structure of the radiated material. Electrons are\nripped out of their atomic relation and move onward\nas free electrons. The consequence for a spacecraft is\na number of mechanisms which can be useful on the\none hand, but can also cause unwanted side effects\non the other hand.\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nThe effects on electrical characteristics are as\nfollows.\n\nPhotoelectric Effect\n\nSolar cells convert the free electrons into electric power\nby using the photovoltaic effect (see Section 4.2).\nSolar arrays are the basis of the power supply system\nof almost all of today\u2019s spacecraft. Today, they create\nan area-related power of approx. 350 W/m\u2019. Due to\nthe larger distance to the Sun, solar arrays do not\ncreate sufficient power to supply a spacecraft beyond\nthe inner planets. This is why radioisotopic thermal\ngenerators (RTGs) have to be used instead for missions\nto the outer planets.\n\nElectrostatic Charging\n\nAn unwanted side effect of the removal of electrons\nfrom their atomic structure at the surface of the\nspacecraft is electrostatic charging. Positive charge is\ncreated on the illuminated side as opposed to the no-\nnilluminated side (differential charging). This positive\ncharge can partly compensate for the negative charging\nof the highly energetic electrons of the plasma ambi-\nance (see Section 2.1.4.4). The charge level is determi-\nned by the attitude of the spacecraft relative to the Sun,\namong other factors. Satellites on Sun-synchronous\npolar orbits with one side permanently facing toward\nthe Sun experience a higher risk than spin-stabilized\ninterplanetary probes do, for example.\n\nDue to solar flares the amount of short-wave\nradiation may increase a thousandfold or even more\n{2.1.4]. This may cause spontaneous discharge effects\non the structure of the spacecraft. The change between\nsolar illumination phases and eclipses may also trig-\nger electric discharges. Moreover, operational events\nsuch as orbit maneuvers, turning on the downlink\ntelemetry, or similar electronic activities, often are\ntriggering electrostatic discharges [2.1.5]. During a\ndischarge process high electric currents either flow\non the satellite surface (in case of differential charg-\ning) or even discharge as an electric arc between the\nspacecraft and the surrounding plasma (arcing).\n\nPossible consequences of these discharge processes\nare:\n\ne Degradation of solar cells\n\ne Degradation of optical sensors\n\ne Acceleration of the degradation of the surface\ncoatings.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:05 AM\n",
    "68": "2.1 The Space Environment\n\nA simple preventive measure is to use conductive\nmaterials for the outer structure of the spacecraft. In\nthe case of solar arrays the use of such materials is,\nhowever, limited. As a compromise between electrical\nconductivity and optical transparency, indium oxide\nis used for the cover glass layer of the solar cells. Thus,\nthe surface-related electrical resistance can be reduced\nto under 5000 Q/cm? [2.1.4].\n\nChange in Electrical Resistance\n\nThe removal of electrons from their atomic struc-\n\nture caused by UV radiation leads to only minor\n\nchanges in the electrical resistance of electronic\ncomponents.\n\nEffects on the mechanical/optical characteristics\ninclude:\n\ne Embrittlement: This is another kind of damage to\nthe material caused by hard UV radiation. It has an\neffect on the stiffness of the mechanical structure\nand is particularly relevant at the component level\nfor mechanisms or mechanically stressed compo-\nnents. Much polymer material tends to embrittle\neasily [2.1.4].\n\ne Darkening: Due to a change at the atomic level, a\ndarkening takes place in optically transparent ma-\nterial. This also includes optical lenses, cover glass\nlayers of solar cells, and the glue between the cover\nglass and solar cell. Direct consequences are lower\nillumination of optical instruments and solar cells\nas well as an increase in the surface temperature of\nthe solar cells due to the increase of the @/e relation\n(see Section 4.3) of the cover glass layer, which is\nimportant for the heat balance.\n\nBoth the poorer illumination of the cells and the\nincrease in cell temperature lead to a lower efficiency\nof power generation.\n\n2.1.4.3 Atmospheric Influences\n\nNaturally, atmospheric effects only become significant\nin close distance to planet surfaces. Consequently, the\natmosphere of the Earth is only relevant for spacecraft\noperating in LEO. Although very thin at altitudes\nabove 120 km, the neutral gas atmosphere has an\neffect on a spacecraft in LEO due to the atmospheric\ndrag it causes.\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:47\n\n47\n\nAs already mentioned in Section 2.1.1,a slipstream\narises behind the spacecraft during the crossing of\nthe residual atmosphere, meaning an area with sig-\nnificantly lower ambient pressure. This area can be\nused for very specific experiments that have high\nrequirements with respect to the vacuum.\n\nThe composition and density of the residual at-\nmosphere are strongly linked to geomagnetic and\nsolar incidents since they heat up and therefore ex-\npand the upper atmosphere. At a height of 500 km,\nfor example, the density of the atmosphere may vary\nby a factor of 100 between solar minima and maxima.\nConsequently, the atmospheric drag experienced by\nthe spacecraft is subject to strong fluctuations which\nhave to be taken into account for mission design and\nlifetime calculations.\n\nOne example of the significant effects of the oscil-\n\nlating atmospheric drag in LEO is the uncontrolled\ndeorbiting of the science research module Skylab in\n1979. A period of extremely high solar activity led to\nan unexpected increase of atmospheric drag, forcing\nthe module to reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere even\nbefore a rescue mission could be initiated. The ISS\nloses between 100 and 200 m of height in orbit each\nday. This is why it has to be regularly reboosted into its\nnominal orbit either by means of its own thrusters or\nby those of a visiting, docked spacecraft. Publicly acces-\nsible indices help to predict the characteristics and the\ncondition of the residual atmosphere. The atmospheric\ndrag expected during a mission can be calculated; it is\na function of the cross-sectional area of a spacecraft,\nits starting date, its orbit and its inclination.\nThe atomic oxygen ratio within the residual at-\nmosphere creates an aggressive environment for the\nmaterial of a spacecraft. This is not only the result\nof its chemical responsiveness, but also and more\nlikely a combination of the latter with the high rela-\ntive velocity of about 8 km/s with which the atoms\nhit the surface. The well-known effects are erosion,\nformation of stable oxides and chemoluminescent\nglow (spacecraft glowing). Due to erosion, volatile\nproducts are created, resulting in a recession of the\nsurface and a self-contamination of the spacecraft.\nHighly susceptible materials are Kapton, polyethylene\nand pure silver [2.1.4], [2.1.15]. The large amount of\nsilver that is used in solar arrays has to be therefore\nprotected from direct oxygen flow.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:05 AM\n",
    "69": "CHO2.indd Sect:48\n\n48\n\nSecondary effects of the erosion process are irre-\nversible degradation of material properties (optical,\nthermal, mechanical, electrical), degradation in the\nquality of lubrication due to oxidation, and possible\ncracking within surface coatings. Spacecraft with high\nlife expectancy (e.g., the ISS) and particularly sensi-\ntive optical instruments operating in an orbit below\n500 km have to take into consideration the impact of\natomic oxygen.\n\nThe short-wave radiation of the Sun causes io-\nnization of parts of the upper atmospheric layer\n(photoionization, see Section 2.1.3). The density of\nthe generated plasma within the ionosphere reaches\nits maximum at a height of 300 to 400 km. Never-\ntheless, the density of the neutral atmosphere below\n1000 km is still considerably higher. The ionosphere\nhas a significant influence on the diffusion of radio\nwaves. Radio waves whose frequency is below the\nplasma frequency f, ~ 9000 Ve (with n, = density of\nelectrons per cm\u2122) are reflected at the ionosphere. The\nadditional existence of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field leads\nto a reversion of the polarization of all electromagnetic\nradiation passing it [2.1.4].\n\nThese effects may have a negative influence on the\ncommunications with a spacecraft.\n\nApart from erosion caused by atomic oxygen, the at-\nmospheres of other celestial bodies exert similar forces.\nIt is worth mentioning the controlled deceleration of\norbiters in a planet\u2019s atmosphere (aerobraking) in\norder to reach a desired orbit around that planet while\nsimultaneously reducing fuel consumption signifi-\ncantly (Mars Global Surveyor, Venus Express).\n\nThe interaction of a spacecraft with the atmosphere\nduring launch/landing and reentry is described in\nSection 2.3.\n\n2.1.4.4 High-Energy Particle Radiation\n\nDuring its mission every space vehicle is exposed\nto a continuous particle flux of varying intensity.\nHigh-energy particles with energies in the MeV range\nhit the spacecraft at high velocity and produce sig-\nnificant disturbances and danger. The density of the\nparticle flux and its effects are considered early in the\ndesign phase. The radiation environment drives the\nselection of the operational orbit during the design\nphase. The expected radiation dose is determined by\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nthe utilization of dedicated models, and their effects\nare characterized depending on particle parameters.\nThe following sources produce particles which influ-\nence space vehicles:\n\ne Radiation belt\n\ne Solar flares\n\ne Cosmic particle radiation\n\ne Secondary particle radiation\n\ne Other radiation sources.\n\nHigh-energy solar wind electrons and protons are\ncaptured by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and concent-\nrated in radiation belts (Van Allen belts). The inner\nradiation belt reaches closest to the surface of the\nEarth (about 500 km) in the South Atlantic area due\nto the Earth\u2019s magnetic field being tilted and shifted\nrelative to its rotational axis. This is known as the\nSouth Atlantic anomaly (SAA). It dominates the\ndoses of high-energy particles for vehicles in LEOs\nwith low inclinations. This phenomenon needs to\nbe taken into account during the spacecraft design\nphase. The radiation belts are crossed by LEOs as\nwell as higher orbits (GEO and beyond). The effect\nof protons is more dominant in low orbits, whereas\nelectrons have a larger influence in higher orbits.\nDue to the geometry of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field,\nspacecraft in polar orbits (> 80\u00b0 inclination) are\nirectly exposed to the solar wind. In these orbits\nthe maximum tolerable radiation dose (equivalent\ndose) for astronauts is reached within about 5\u20147\nays. Particles originating in the radiation belts cause\negradation of electronic components, solar cells and\nmaterials; they are responsible for electric charging\nand so-called single event phenomena. In addition,\nthey reduce the sensitivity of highly sensitive optical\ninstruments (CCDs). Collision with highly energetic\nparticles can cause radioactive radiation (activati-\non). This leads to an increased background noise\nin sensitive measuring equipment and threatens\nbiological systems.\n\nThe degradation of electronic components is\ncaused by the ionizing effects of colliding particles.\nSolar cells degrade due to the displacement or bulk\ndamage of atoms within their crystal structure caused\nby the nonionizing component of particle radiation.\nThe materials used are sensitive to ionizing as well as\nnonionizing particle radiation.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:05 AM\n",
    "70": "2.1 The Space Environment\n\nElectrostatic charging of a spacecraft is caused eit-\nher by collision and \u201csticking\u201d of high-energy charged\nplasma particles (usually electrons) on the outer surface\n(surface charging) or by the accumulation of high-\nenergy particles in dielectric materials (wire isolation,\ncircuit boards) within the spacecraft (deep dielectric\ncharging). The latter phenomenon in particular can\nhave dramatic consequences as the resulting discharge\neffects can take place via electronic circuits.\n\nSingle event phenomena are caused by single colli-\n\nsions of very high-energy particles such as heavy ions,\n\nprotons or neutrons originating from cosmic particle\nradiation or solar flares. Even protons from the inner\nradiation belt can cause single event phenomena by\nproducing heavy energetic particles upon impact.\n\nThese phenomena are a severe threat to electronic\n\ncomponents. The degree of destructions is distingu-\n\nished by the linear energy transfer (LET):\n\ne Single event upset: temporary switch of the logi-\ncal state of an integrated circuit causing a wrong\ncommand to, for example, the attitude control\nsystem.\n\ne Single event latchup: static change of a circuit state\nwhich can only be recovered by a reset.\n\ne Single event burnout: destruction of an integrated\ncircuit.\n\nIn order to assure mission success, appropriate measures\nhave to be taken in the design phase against single event\nphenomena [2.1.4]. Solar flares and coronal mass ejec-\ntions (CMEs) produce an enormous number of high-\nenergy particles which are propelled into interplanetary\nspace. This results in short-term and highly fluctuating\nradiation doses which act upon a spacecraft.\n\nGalactic cosmic rays are composed of high-energy\nprotons (83%), alpha particles (13%), electrons (3%)\nand atomic nuclei with atomic numbers greater than\n2 (1%). The energy of cosmic rays ranges between 100\nand 10\u201d MeV [2.1.4]. Despite the low density of inter-\ngalactic particle radiation (in the order of a few par-\nticles per square centimeter per second) they do pose\na threat to spacecraft due to their high impulse. Very\nhigh-energy protons can hit with almost the speed of\nlight and thus cause destruction to sensitive materials,\nelectronic components and biological tissue.\n\nSecondary particle radiation is made up of parti-\ncles which are generated by the impact of high-energy\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:49\n\n49\n\nparticles and then themselves interact with the space-\ncraft and cause disturbances.\n\nOther sources of energetic particle radiation are\nions generated by interaction with the upper at-\nmosphere and neutrons as well as particle emissions\nfrom radioactive sources on-board a spacecraft (e.g.,\nradioisotopic thermal generators (RTGs)).\n\n2.1.4.5 High Vacuum\n\nThe very low ambient pressure in space beyond the\n\nneutral atmosphere (> 100 km altitude) also has a\n\ndetermining influence on the design and operation\n\nof a spacecraft. At an altitude of 500 km above the\n\nEarth\u2019s surface, for example, the barometric pressure\n\nis reduced to 10\u201d Pa, whereas at the distance of a geo-\n\nstationary orbit (36 000 km) it has already converged\n\nto the value of interstellar space, approx. 107'\u00b0 Pa. A\n\nset of mechanisms and/or physical processes have to\n\nbe highlighted in this context:\n\ne Outgassing/sublimation\n\ne Missing natural convection\n\ne Change of material properties such as mechanical\nstrength and life span/material fatigue\n\ne Cold welding.\n\nDue to the low ambient pressure, absorbed gas and\n\nwater vapor escape from the materials. Sublimation\n\ndescribes the process of the evaporation of atoms/mo-\n\nlecules from the surface as soon as the ambient pressure\n\nachieves and/or falls below the specific steam pressure\n\nof the material. The generic term outgassing refers to\n\ngases or particles escaping from the surface of a material.\n\nThe outgassing rate increases with ambient tempera-\n\nture. Outgassing involves mass loss and a change in the\n\nsurface properties of the materials concerned. Structural\n\nproblems are not expected from outgassing. The fol-\n\nlowing materials particularly tend to outgassing:\n\ne Water\n\ne Solvents\n\ne Additives\n\ne \u201cUncured monomeric material\u201d\n\ne Deposits which contaminated the spacecraft be-\nfore or during the mission.\n\nThe outgassing products represent a danger for sen-\nsitive components, for example optical instruments,\nthermal coatings and high-voltage devices.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:06 AM\n",
    "71": "CHO2.indd Sec1:50\n\n50\n\nIn the following section the influence of these\noutgassing products on the self-contamination of the\nspacecraft is described.\n\nTraditional lubricants used on Earth are not suitable\nfor space applications since they generally possess a high\nspecific steam pressure and are often based on absorbed\ngases or water. As an alternative, coatings of graphite or\nmolybdenum disulfite (MoS,) are applied.\n\nHeat Transfer\n\nDue to the extremely low particle density of space,\nthe process of convection, which is very important\non Earth, plays a rather negligible role. The heat ba-\nlancing between spacecraft and space environment\ntakes place almost exclusively by radiant heat. The\nheat energy is exchanged internally by radiation and\nconduction. This is a major challenge for the design of\nthe temperature control system (TCS), particularly\nfor spacecraft which have to dissipate excessive heat.\n\nChanges in Material Properties\n\nMechanical strength, life span and material fatigue\nare subject to change in the high vacuum environ-\nment. Generally, the life span of mechanically stressed\nconstruction units increases. For a lot of materials the\nfatigue behavior improves by more than one order of\nmagnitude, although for some materials (e.g., nickel,\nInconel 550) no statement can be given and reference\nis made to current materials research results. Material\nbehavior in high vacuum is currently a subject of\nresearch on the ISS.\n\nThe increase in the mechanical strength of glass\nwith falling ambient pressure is very well documented.\nIt triples when the ambient pressure decreases from\n1 bar to 1 mbar.\n\nCold Welding\n\nMetallic parts lying close to each other can weld to-\ngether due to the escape of the intermittent gas layer\nexisting on Earth. Particularly with mobile parts this\neffect is regarded as critical.\n\n2.1.4.6 Contamination\n\nContamination of Spacecraft\nAn individual forecast of the degree of contamination\nis very difficult to make since a wide range of different\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nmaterials with very variable degassing characteristics\nis involved. Beyond this, the complexity of a conta-\nmination model is still further increased due to the\ninteraction of the outgassing products with surfaces,\nthe residual gas atmosphere, electromagnetic radiati-\non, as well as high-energy particle radiation.\nAs sources of contamination the following phe-\nnomena have been identified:\ne Degassing, including decay products.\ne Particle plumes from the combustion processes of\npropulsion systems.\ne Particle populations resulting from ion bombard-\nment in plasma (\u201csputtering\u201d).\ne Impact of micrometeorites and space debris.\ne Ignition of pyrotechnic units or activation of\nrelease mechanisms.\n\nMolecular degassing products partly disintegrate\nunder the influence of short-wave solar radiation,\nhigh-energy particle radiation, atomic oxygen and\nelectrostatic discharge processes. Thus, the contami-\nnation degree of a spacecraft is also influenced to a\ncertain degree by solar activity and the interaction\nwith the Earth\u2019s magnetic field; it therefore varies in\ntime during the mission.\n\nAs a preventive measure against outgassing in\nspace, a bake-out test is performed in a thermal\nvacuum chamber on the spacecraft before its launch\n(baking) in order to artificially start the outgassing\nprocess already on Earth.\n\nSo-called plumes are generated during the firing of\nhe thrusters of the attitude and orbit control system\nnd deposit on surfaces.\n\nThe impact of ions removes atoms from the sur-\nface and creates a particle population which may also\nistribute onto other surfaces (sputtering). Electro-\nstatic charging may increase this effect as further ions\nare pushed toward the spacecraft due to the electric\npotential.\n\nConsequently, the main focus concerning the\neffects of contamination is on the degradation of the\nefficiency of spacecraft systems or their subsystems\ndue to:\n\ne Particle contamination on delicate surfaces (main-\nly outgassing).\n\ne Impact on thermo-optical properties.\n\ne Impact on lubrication properties.\n\ne Impact on electrical conductivity.\n\n2\n\n2/25/09 11:03:06 AM\n",

Also the optical\nsurfaces (lenses, mirrors) have to deal with this issue\nwhereas, additionally, the transparency of the lenses\nand the reflecting power of the mirrors are adversely\naffected. In high-voltage components short circuits\nmay occur due to outgassing. This is why, if possible,\nthe commissioning of systems only starts after the\noutgassing process has reached a less critical level\n(after a few days, up to one month).\n\nContamination by the Spacecraft\n\nWhen considering contamination, also the conta-\nmination of extraterrestrial matter by a terrestrial\nspacecraft should be taken into account.\n\nOne of the most dominant driving forces of\nhumankind is to enhance its living space and its\nknowledge in search of the origin of its existence. This\ninevitably leads to contact between formerly biolo-\ngically separated worlds (Apollo, Viking, SMART-1,\nHuygens, Rosetta).\n\nThere is acommon agreement among spacefaring\nnations that unintended biological contamination of\nother celestial bodies by a terrestrial spacecraft has to\nbe avoided. The scientific measurements undertaken\nin the search for extraterrestrial life must not be bi-\nased and the risk of destruction of possible life forms\nmust be minimized.\n\nInterplanetary probes and landers go through\nintensive cleaning and decontamination processes\nwhich are defined by standards. Similar rules apply\nfor extraterrestrial material taken back to Earth from\nsample return missions. The current lunar initiati-\nves of almost all space agencies (NASA, ESA, ISRO,\nCNSA), the exploration of Titan, Venus and Mercury\n(Cassini/Huygens, Venus Express, Bepi Colombo), and\nthe already planned sample return or human space\nmissions to Mars (USA, ESA), serve as references.\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:51\n\n51\n\n2.1.4.7 Micrometeoroids and Space Debris\n\nAnother dominating environmental effect on space\nvehicles is created by solid particles which are present\nin interplanetary space as well as within the Earth\u2019s\norbit. These objects are either natural or artificial\nobjects, also called space debris. Natural objects in\nEarth orbits are meteoroids, micrometeoroids, comets,\nasteroids and dust. Artificial objects include decom-\nmissioned satellites, rocket stages (partly exploded)\nand fragments, lost tools from space walks, paint\nparticles and other such material.\n\nThe chances of a spacecraft being hit by a natural\nobject are rather small. Exceptions are cyclically re-\ncurring meteoroid showers (Perseids, Leonids), whose\nintensities are higher than the annual average by a fac-\ntor of 100. Artificial objects, however, especially small\nnontrackable objects, impose a much higher threat to\nhuman space flight and unmanned spacecraft because\ntheir number is very high. Objects more than 10 cm in\nsize are tracked by radar stations, in contrast to smaller\nobjects which are the most dangerous to spacecraft.\nEven very small particles in the submillimeter range\ncan cause severe damage when they hit a spacecraft at\nspeeds in excess of 10 km/s. Great effort is put into the\ndevelopment of multiple layer shielding mechanisms,\nwhich are based on the fragmentation of impacting\nobjects and conversion of kinetic into thermal energy.\nThe Ernst Mach Institute for Short-Time Dynamics,\nin Freiburg, Germany, has investigated this subject in\ndetail by experiment and simulation.\n\nA more detailed discussion of safety measures, col-\nlision probability and risks is given in Section 2.4.\n\nBibliography\n\n2.1.1 Prilss, G.W.

The physical models and methods of\ncalculation they derived from these observations are\nalso useful in many ways for describing the motion\nof artificial Earth-orbiting satellites. Their large\nnumber and closeness have conversely contributed\nto ever-improving understanding and more precise\nmodeling of the forces involved. Having begun with\nSputnik, which for the first time was able to prove that\nthe Earth is actually pear shaped, modern satellites\ntoday like the GRACE formation allow us to follow\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nseasonal variations in the Earth\u2019s gravitational field.\nAn accurate description of the orbital mechanics of\nsatellites is therefore not only important for operating\nthe satellites themselves, but also of great relevance for\ngeophysical research in general.\n\nThe following section begins by introducing\nthe foundational concepts of the laws of celestial\nmechanics of satellites within the realm of Earth\u2019s\ngravity. They allow the modeling and prediction\nof satellite orbits and also form the basis for deter-\nmining satellite orbits based upon radiometric or\noptical measurements. Besides the procedures for\nadjustment computation and filtering, various sen-\nsors and measurement methods used in spacecraft\nnavigation will be introduced. The last section will\nuse the example of remote sensing satellites and geo-\nstationary satellites to explain the methods of orbit\ndetermination and station keeping.\n\n2.2.1 Orbit Modeling\n\n2.2.1.1 Kepler Orbits\n\nAs described in the introduction, the motion of an\n\nEarth satellite follows the same basic physical laws\n\nthat apply to the motion of planets around the Sun,\n\nor the Moon around the Earth. They were first derived\nby Johannes Kepler from observations of the planets.\n\nLater, with the help of Newton\u2019s law of universal\n\ngravitation, these motions could also be physically\n\nunderstood. Transposed to the case of a satellite in\n\nEarth\u2019s gravitational field, Kepler\u2019s three laws of pla-\n\nnetary motion are:\n\n1. The orbit ofa satellite around the Earth is an ellipse\n(or more generally, a conic section), one focus of\nwhich coincides with the center of the Earth.\n\n2. The radius vector from the Earth\u2019s center to the\nsatellite sweeps over equal areas in equal time\nintervals.\n\n3. The squares of the orbital periods of two satellites\nare proportional to the cubes of their average\ndistance to the Earth\u2019s center.\n\nKepler\u2019s first law implies that the motion of a satellite\ntakes place in an invariable orbital plane that passes\nthrough the Earth\u2019s center. The reason is that the\nEarth\u2019s attraction (to a first approximation) is always\n\n2/25/09 11:03:07 AM\n",

Once an orbital plane has been\nestablished, it can no longer be left. Kepler\u2019s second\nlaw is also a direct result of these conditions and\nstates nothing more than the conservation of angular\nmomentum in a central force field.\n\nBy contrast, the elliptical orbit and the dependence\nof the orbital period on the size of the orbit are a result\nof the inverse-square reduction of the gravitational\nacceleration\n\n._ GMe r\nrae (2.2.1)\n\nwith the distance from the Earth\u2019s center (Newton\u2019s\nlaw of gravity).

Unfortunately, this reveals that a\nclosed-form representation of the orbital position as\na function of time is not possible and that instead an\nimplicit description must be chosen.

For this reason, by the time the Sun once\nagain reaches its highest point after one (solar) day, 4\nminutes more have elapsed than the time necessary\nfor one Earth rotation relative to the fixed stars.\n\nFor simple applications sidereal time as a function\nof universal time (UT1) can be computed using the\nformula\n\nO = 280.4606\u00b0 + 360.985 647 3\u00b0: d\n\nin which d represents the number of days since noon\non January 1, 2000.

For\nthe Earth this assumption is certainly appropriate in\na first approximation, but closer examination reveals\na number of variations from this ideal picture. First\nis the fact that due to its rotation the Earth\u2019s radius\nat the poles is about 20 km smaller than at the equa-\ntor. This flattening (oblateness) and the resulting\ndeviation from the perfect hypothetical central force\nleads, among other things, to a continual change in the\norbital planes of satellites. Other perturbations result\nfrom the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which causes a conti-\nnual braking of low-flying satellites and so a loss of\naltitude. For higher flying satellites the gravitational\nperturbations caused by the Sun and the Moon play\narole. For exact orbital calculations, many effects (the\ninhomogeneous distribution of mass within the Earth,\nradiation pressure, tides, relativistic effects, etc.) must\nbe accounted for. The magnitudes of the most impor-\ntant perturbations are illustrated in Figure 2.2.6.\n\nGravity\n\nFora practical description of Earth\u2019s gravity, an expan-\nsion of the gravitational potential in terms of spherical\nharmonics can be employed.

This is particularly important to consider\nwhen modeling geostationary satellite orbits.\n\nAir Drag\n\nBesides the flattening of the Earth, for low-flying\nsatellites atmospheric braking represents the greatest\nsource of perturbation. In contrast to gravitatio-\nnal perturbations, here the effective acceleration is\ndependent upon the mass m of the satellite and its\ncross-sectional area A. For a given density p of the\natmosphere, the drag can be modeled in the simplest\ncase using the relationship\n\nA\u00a5 = -3& ADV Meet (2.2.20)\nThis is always related to the velocity vector v,,; relative\nto the direction of the atmosphere and grows as the\nsquare of the velocity.\n\nThe drag coefficient C, represents the individual\naerodynamic characteristics of a particular body.\nUsually it must be calibrated for a satellite when cal-\nculating the orbit. Values between 2.0 and 2.3 are often\nused as a rough estimate. Alternatively, the drag coeffi-\ncient can be determined using model calculations that\ntake into account the atmospheric conditions in the\nupper atmosphere [2.2.9]. However, these so-called\ncomputational fluid dynamic calculations (CFD\ncalculations) are very complex and can usually only\nbe employed for practical calculations after simplified\nmacromodels are derived.\n\nFigure 2.2.8 shows an overview of density varia-\ntions in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As can be seen clearly,\nthe density decreases rapidly with increasing altitude\nand the atmosphere can be largely disregarded for\norbits above 1000 km. In contrast, for altitudes be-\nlow 250 km the drag is so high that without regular\nmaneuvers to raise the orbit, a rapid reentry of the\nsatellite would be unavoidable. In general, because of\nthe desire for a long life span, only a very few satellites\nare operated below 400 km.\n\nIn total, atmospheric drag results in a continual\nreduction of orbital energy and therefore of the\nsemi-major axis. For a circular orbit this results\nin a continuous decrease in orbital altitude that at\nfirst proceeds slowly, then evermore quickly (see\nFigure 2.2.9).

At the lowest\npoint in the orbit the satellite dips into the lowest and\ntherefore thickest layers of the atmosphere. At the\nsame time the velocity is highest at this point, further\nincreasing the effects of drag. As a result of this uneven\nbraking the apogee altitude at first decreases, until the\norbit is nearly circularized.\n\nFor a description of atmospheric density vari-\nous models are available that offer a typical predic-\ntion accuracy between 10 and 30% [2.2.1], [2.2.2],\n[2.2.10]. Best known are the models of the Jacchia\nseries (Jacchia-70 and further developments), the\nfamily of the \u201cMass Spectrometer and Incoherent\nScatter\u201d models (MSIS-86, NRLMSIS) and the \u201cDrag\nTemperature Models\u201d (DTM-94, DTM-2000).

Simple density models are\nusually sufficient for a good reconstruction of the\norbit from observations. Conversely, more modeling\neffort is required to exactly determine the orbit for a\npure orbit prediction.\n\nAtmospheric density displays a pronounced\nday-night variation due to solar warming, with\nthe maximum effect being reached about 2 hours\nafter midday. Furthermore, it has been shown that\natmospheric density is subject to large variations\nwhich correlate with solar activity (extreme ultravi-\nolet rays) and geomagnetic activity. For this reason\nall density models require the inclusion of a value\nfor solar flux (radio flux F,)7 at a wavelength of\n10.7 cm as an indirect measure for the UV flux) as\nwell as the geomagnetic index (K,). Both quantities\nmust be determined by measurements and have\nonly limited predictability. Long-term forecasting\nof satellite orbits in the atmosphere is therefore\nseverely restricted.\n\nRadiation Pressure\n\nA second nongravitational force that must be consi-\ndered when modeling satellite orbits results from the\nradiation pressure of the Sun.

In its place the so-\ncalled radiation pressure coefficient C, = 1 + \u20ac is\noften used, and as with the drag coefficient can be\ncalibrated within limits. As a first approximation a\nvalue of 1.3 is often used.\n\nAs expected, radiation pressure is a particular\nconcern for satellites that possess large solar panels for\nproducing energy. For geostationary satellites with an\narea of up to 50 m\u2019, radiation pressure represents one\nof the greatest perturbing factors that must be consi-\ndered when maintaining an orbit. This leads to a yearly\nvariation in the eccentricity that must be compensated\nwith regular maneuvers to prevent leaving the assigned\ngeostationary window (see Section 2.2.3.3).\n\nPrecise modeling of radiation pressure is also\nimportant for navigation satellites or remote sensing\nsatellites with tight requirements for knowledge of the\norbit.

How these variations look\nin detail is described, for example, by the Gaussian\nvariational equations. If one decomposes the pertur-\nbing acceleration a into three orthogonal components\nalong the radial direction (R), perpendicular to the\nradial direction in the direction of motion (T) and in\nthe direction of the orbit normal (N), this produces\n\n2p\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:61\n\n61\n\nthe following expressions for the temporal variation\nof the orbital elements [2.2.1], [2.2.13]:\n\nda 2\n\n= inveartl-\ndt \u201croe [esin v agt ar| (2.2.24)\n\nde 1-2 ,.\na nan [sinv *agt (cosE +cosv)- ar |\nna\n(2.2.25)\ndi 1\n= \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_ rcosu- ay (2.2.26)\n\ndt = na?Ji-e\n\ndQ 1 rsinu\n\n= a\ndt na2v1l\u2014-& sini N (2.2.27)\ndw -Vl- @ [-cose \u2018apt ( + \u201cin v: ar]\n\nt nae P\ndQ\n\u2014cosi: \u2014 (2.2.28)\ndt\ndMo __1 (2.2.29)\ndt n@e ~\n\n-[ (pcos v\u2014-2er) \u2018dg\u2014(p +r) sinv ar]\n\nIf one first assumes an unperturbed orbit, it is then\npossible to calculate the perturbations along the orbit\nand \u2014 with corresponding effort \u2014 represent them as a\nperiodic series expansion. This can then be integrated\nto achieve an analytical description of the change in\nthe orbital elements over time. When necessary, the\nthus corrected orbital representation can again be\ninserted into the perturbation equations to obtain\nhigher order perturbation theories.\n\nA well-known example is the perturbation theory\nconstructed by W. M. Kaula [2.2.14], which describes\nthe changes to an orbit under the influence of the\nEarth\u2019s gravitational field. The perturbations can be\ndivided into periodic and secular (growing over time)\nchanges to the orbital elements (Figure 2.2.11).\n\nVariations with a typical time scale of a single\norbit are referred to as short-periodic perturbations.\nLong-periodic perturbations reflect the changes to\nthe perigee altitude under the influence of the Earth\u2019s\n\n2/25/09 11:03:16 AM\n",

Kaula\u2019s\ntheory shows among other things that the secular per-\nturbations from Earth\u2019s gravitational field only appear\nin the angular elements of the orbit. Perturbations of\nthe semi-major axis and the eccentricity are, however,\nonly subject to the periodical portion.\n\nThe SGP4 Model\nCertainly one of the most popular orbit models is\nthe \u201cSimplified General Perturbations Model\u201d No. 4\n(SGP4) [2.2.15], [2.2.16]. It was originally developed\nfor the needs of the North American Aerospace De-\nfense Command (NORAD), an organization also re-\nsponsible for the continuous monitoring of near-Earth\nobjects. Part of this responsibility includes the regular\ndetermination of the orbital elements of all cataloged\nsatellites, which within limits are also available to civi-\nlian users. Amateur radio operators in particular profit\nfrom this service, which they can use to easily generate\ncurrent visibility predictions for their satellites.\n\nThe NORAD orbital elements are published in\na two-line data format, which has earned them the\nnickname \u201ctwo-line elements\u201d (TLEs). The meaning\nof the individual fields in the TLE data is described\nin Figure 2.2.12.\n\nWhen using the NORAD two-line elements it must\nbe borne in mind that they represent \u201caverage\u201d orbital\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nelements. In contrast to \u201cosculating\u201d elements that at a\nparticular time reflect the actual position and velocity\nof the satellite, average elements are free of model-\nspecific periodic perturbations. They therefore show\na much smoother progression than the osculating\nelements. Conversely, the average elements should\nnever be used with a simple Keplerian orbit model,\nbut rather only with the analytical orbit model that\nwas used to generate them.\n\nThe SGP4 model employed by NORAD for this\npurpose was created around 1970 and is based upon an\nanalytical orbit model from Lane and Crawford. This\nmodel combines modeling of the gravitational per-\nturbations from Brouwer [2.2.17] with an analytical\nmodel describing drag. The atmospheric density at an\naltitude h is described using a power law of the form\n\n4\np=2.461-10-8 twin) (2.2.30)\n_ m\n\nFor operational use the complete theory from Lane\nand Hoots was simplified and combined with the still\ncommon form of the SGP4 model. The secular and\nperiodical perturbations are accounted for by the\ngravitational field coefficients J,, J; and J,. Strictly\nspeaking, the representation of the periodical pertur-\nbations only applies to near-circular orbits.\n\nIn addition to the SGP4 model NORAD uses an ex-\ntended form of the SGP4 model called the SDP4 model\nfor high-altitude satellites. This considers additional\nperturbations caused by the gravity of the Sun and\nMoon, as well as resonance terms that are significant\nfor orbits with periods between 12 h (GPS) and 24h\n(geostationary satellites). The SDP4 model is used for\nthe generation of two-line elements when the orbital\nperiod ofa satellite is greater than 225 minutes (so-cal-\nled \u201cdeep-space\u201d orbits). This value corresponds to an\norbital altitude of about 6000 km and serves the users\nof the two-line elements as a discriminating criterion\nfor the choice of the correct orbit model.\n\nThe accuracy of the SGP4 orbit model and the\ntwo-line elements produced by it are illustrated in\nFigure 2.2.13 fora low-flying satellite (altitude 400 km).\nClose to the epoch the actual orbit is given within an\naccuracy of 1-2 km. This value reflects the magnitu-\nde of a series of short-period perturbations that are\nignored in the SGP4 model. This then represents a\n\n2/25/09 11:03:17 AM\n",

Two-line elements can be used effectively here\neven for predictions spanning several weeks.\n\n2.2.1.5 Numerical Orbital Predictions\n\nAn alternative to the analytical models described abo-\nve is the use of purely numerical methods to compute\nsatellite orbits. Beginning with the known position\nand velocity at a specific time, numerical integration\nis used to predict the motion from one epoch to the\nnext. A series of different single-step and multistep\nprocesses are available for this calculation, the basis of\nwhich will be introduced later in this section.\n\nThe choice of a suitable integration method de-\npends upon the eccentricity of the orbit, the length of\nthe orbital arc being handled, the required accuracy\nand several other factors. A \u201cbest\u201d scheme is therefore\nimpossible to name and users must always choose for\nthemselves the most advantageous alternative. In ge-\nneral it is possible to note that higher order schemes\nare required to handle longer term predictions and\nto minimize the influence of rounding errors. The\ntheoretical basis for these methods and their imple-\nmentation in computer programs are extensively de-\nscribed in textbooks for numerical mathematics and\nrelated monographs (see [2.2.18]). For a comparative\nevaluation of numerical integration schemes for\npredicting satellite orbits, see [2.2.2] and [2.2.19].\n\nEquation of Motion\nThe basis for the numerical integration is the descrip-\ntion of the orbital motion by a suitable differential\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nequation. Here we restrict ourselves to an equation of\nmotion of the form y = f (4 y(t) for the state vector\n\nro-(0) (2.2.31)\n\ncomposed of position and velocity.\nThe derivative\n\nv(t)\ntLyt))=]..\nMEYD)= | oe ny) (2.2.32)\nof the state vector in turn contains the velocity and\nacceleration vectors. In contrast to analytical orbit\nmodels requiring a closed-form analytic representation\nof the perturbation acceleration, numerical methods\nare subject to less stringent limitations. Here it is\nprincipally sufficient that the acceleration\n\nT= AGray + Asunt+ @Mioon + Drag + AsolRad + - - -\n(2.2.33)\n\ncan be calculated pointwise and is progressively\nsmooth enough. This is particularly important for\nmodeling nongravitational forces whose calculation\noften involves interpolating table values.\n\nRunge-Kutta Methods\n\nThe family of Runge-Kutta methods is among the\nbest-known methods for the numerical integration\nof ordinary differential equations, and can be traced\nto the work of the mathematicians Carl Runge and\nWilhelm Kutta. Starting with the state vector at time f,\nan approximate value at time t + h is calculated as a\nweighted average\n\ny(t+h)=y(t) +h Sb: k; (2.2.34)\n\ni=l\n\nof m derivatives\n\ni-l\nk= flttoh yt)+h Dagk; (2.2.35)\nj=l\nat various midpoints. At each step one only requires the\nstarting value y(t). At the same time the step size h may\nbe freely chosen and adapted to current needs. The Run-\nge-Kutta methods are therefore single-step methods.\nThe coefficients aj, b, and c; are chosen so that a\nbest approximation of the true solution is produced.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:18 AM\n",
    "86": "2.2 Orbital Mechanics\n\nIn this context one speaks of an nth-degree method\nwhen the error of the numerical solution grows more\nslowly than h\u00ae*! with the step size. In general this\nrequires m > n derivatives; only methods up to fourth\ndegree are known for m= n. The coefficients are not\nuniquely determined by the order, meaning that\nthere are indeed different Runge-Kutta methods of\nthe same order.\n\nFor the most common, classical Runge-Kutta\nfourth-order method, the simple set of equations\n\nh\ny(t +h) = y(t) + ra (ky +2k)+2k3+ky) (2.2.36)\n\nholds with\n\nk= fly (0)\n\nk, = f(t+ h/2, y(t) + hk,/2)\nk, = f(t+ h/2, y(t) + hk,/2)\n\nk, = f(t+ h, y(0) + hk,)\n\nFor low-flying Earth satellites the application of this\nmethod lends itself to the use of step sizes between\n30 and 60s. A better approximation for each step\ncan be achieved with substantially smaller values,\nbut the accumulated rounding errors then dominate\nand soon lead to a worse overall result. For precise\norbital predictions across many orbits the use of a\nhigher order method (e.g., DOPRI8 from Dormand\nand Prince, see [2.2.18]) is indispensable. In contrast\nthe RK4 method can be very advantageous for real-\ntime navigation on-board a satellite when the pre-\ndicted orbit is periodically updated with independent\nmeasurements [2.2.19].\n\nMultistep Methods\nMultistep methods follow an alternative approach to\nthe integration of the equations of motion in which\ninformation from past epochs is included in the pre-\ndiction of the next step. Besides the possibility to easily\nachieve higher orders, the necessary steps in multistep\nmethods can be very simply organized. These methods\nwere therefore used successfully very early in the calcu-\nlation of planets and comets, and later assumed their\nnatural place in the prediction of satellite orbits.\n\nThe basis of the multistep methods is the repre-\nsentation of the state vector as an integral with the\nform\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:65\n\n65\n\ntth\n\ny(t+h) = y(t) + Jflc. nae (2.2.37)\nt\n\nIf the values of the state vector and therefore the\nderivative function are known for several previous\ntimes, the chronological sequence of f can be inter-\npolated (and extrapolated) using a polynomial.

This is of particu-\nlar advantage when ~ as in the case of a satellite orbit\n\u2014 the evaluation of the acceleration is very complex\nand requires costly calculations. However, it must be\nnoted that the determination of the necessary starting\nvalues requires a complex starting calculation that\ncomplicates the use of these methods.\n\nIn the above description it was assumed that the\nintegration is carried out with a constant step size.\nThe coefficients of the Adams\u2014Bashforth-Moulton\nmethod are then constants, making them particularly\neasy to use.

The task of\norbit determination is to determine these parameters\nfrom observations of the satellite. Basic procedures for\naccomplishing this task were developed long before the\nfirst artificial satellite by various experts of celestial me-\nchanics, with Karl Friedrich Gauss leading the way. In\ncontrast to newly discovered planetoids or comets, the\norbit of a satellite is usually not completely unknown.\nThe nominal orbit is determined during mission\nplanning before launch. Later the satellite is routinely\nmonitored by mission control so approximate orbital\ninformation is always available. For this reason the\norbit determination of satellites is usually concerned\nwith improvements to approximated starting values\nand only in exceptional cases (e.g., military monitoring\nof intercontinental missiles or space debris) entails a\nclassical initial orbit determination.\n\nIn the further course of this section the two most\nimportant mathematical methods for improving or-\nbital parameters from satellite observations will be\nintroduced: the method of least squares and Kalman\nfiltering. Both methods are related at their core but pur-\nsue different goals and different applications have been\ndeveloped for them. Parameter adjustment according\nto the method of least squares traditionally includes the\ncollective processing of a large number of observations\nand is therefore primarily suited to postprocessing on\nthe ground. The Kalman filter by contrast is particularly\nwell suited to real-time processing, as only measure-\nments performed at the current epoch are processed.\n\nBefore embarking upon a detailed description\nof these methods, it should first be explained which\nmeasuring instruments are available for observing\nand monitoring satellite orbits.\n\n2.2.2.1 Tracking Systems\n\nToday, predominantly radiometric methods are used\nfor the orbital measurement of satellites. This involves\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nusing radio waves of various wavelengths to measure\nthe direction to the satellite, its distance or its velo-\ncity along the line of sight [2.2.21]. Although optical\ncameras were used at the beginning of the space age\nto determine the position, today the use of telescopes\nis mostly limited to monitoring space debris and inac-\ntive satellites. Of great importance for high-precision\norbit determination and geodetic research is the use\nof laser ranging, capable of measuring position with\ncentimeter accuracy.\n\nGround Stations\n\nGround stations serve as the interface between the satel-\nlite and mission control (Figure 2.2.14). Besides relaying\ncommands and receiving telemetry data, many of the\ndeployed antennas can also be used for tracking.\n\nFigure 2.2.14: The 15 m S-band antenna (left) and 11 m Ku-band\nantenna (right) of the DLR ground station in Weilheim, Germany\n\n(Source: DLR).\n\nHorizontal plane\n\nNorth\n\nFigure 2.2.15: Definition of the direction angles azimuth (A) and\nelevation (E).\n\n2/25/09 11:03:20 AM\n",
    "88": "2.2 Orbital Mechanics\n\nIn the simplest case, only the direction of the signal\nis determined. This is normally represented by the two\nangles of azimuth and elevation (Figure 2.2.15). The\nazimuth angle represents how far from north on the\nvertical axis the antenna must be turned to make con-\ntact with the satellite. The elevation describes the com-\nplementary angle above the horizon. Together these two\nvalues uniquely determine the direction to the satellite\nin a local east/north/zenith coordinate system.\n\nTo carry out directional measurements, nothing\nmore than an active transmitter must be on-board the\nsatellite. With the help of a large parabolic dish the\ntransmitted signals are focused in the receiver anten-\nna, also causing a pronounced directivity. Depending\nupon the antenna diameter D and the wavelength A\nof the signal, the reception cone has a characteristic\nbeam angle of\n\nh\ng = 122 (2.2.40)\n\naround the line of sight of the antenna. Precise di-\nrectional measurements therefore require a larger\nantenna and a short wavelength. The S-band, a part\nof the spectrum designated for communication with\nsatellites, is composed of frequencies around 2 GHz\nand wavelengths of approx. 15 cm. The full width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) of the reception cone for\na 15 m antenna is then approximately 0.7\u00b0, which\nwould only allow a very imprecise measurement. The\naccuracy can be significantly improved when several\noffset detectors are used in the antenna receiver instead\nof a single sensor. Instead of the (very flat) sensitivity\nmaximum, the difference between the detector signals\ncan be used to determine the direction. With the help\nof this method, known as monopulse radar (see also\nSection 6.3.4.5), the accuracy in the example above can\nbe increased to better than 0.01\u00b0. This lies far below the\nnominal resolution of the antenna, but requires a good\nangular encoder and a very stable antenna mount.\nAta distance of 600 km the angular measurement\nabove is equivalent to a positional error of 100 m,\nand for a geostationary satellite this increases to\n6 km. One remedy here is distance measurement\n(or ranging) implemented using the signal travel\ntime. In contrast to angular measurements this is an\nactive method that involves sending a signal from the\nground that is returned by the satellite and then recei-\nved back at the ground again. To make a travel time\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:67\n\n67\n\nmeasurement possible, the carrier signal is modulated\nwith a characteristic pattern of superimposed har-\nmonic frequencies (tone ranging) or pseudorandom\nnoise (pseudorandom noise ranging). This makes an\naccuracy from 1 to 10 m possible.\n\nA so-called transponder is required on-board the\nsatellite to receive the signal and return it delay free. To\nprevent interference or feedback, the signal is conver-\nted to a different frequency before it is returned. For\nexample, in the S-band the frequencies from 2025 to\n2120 MHz are designated for the ground to satellite\n(uplink) connection, while in the other direction (down-\nlink) frequencies from 2200 to 2300 MHz are used. In\naccordance with international regulations the relation\nbetween the two frequencies is always 221/240.\n\nAsa third independent method, many ground sta-\ntions can measure the change in distance based upon\nthe Doppler shift of the received signal. If the distance\nbetween the sender and the receiver is increasing at a\nspeed p, a transmitted radio signal of frequency fwill\nbe received with a frequency shift of\n\nAf = _ 72 (2.2.41)\n\nIf the exact transmission frequency is known, it is\npossible to determine the velocity along the line of\nsight by measuring the Doppler shift. In the case\nof two-way measurements using a transponder, the\ncurrent accuracy stands at around 0.1-1 mm/s. In\nprinciple, Doppler measurements are also possible\nwithout a signal broadcast from the ground (one-way\nmeasurement). In this case the measurement accuracy\nis strictly limited by the transmitter frequency stability\non-board the satellite.\n\nSatellite Laser Ranging\nDistance measurement with the help of lasers (satel-\nlite laser ranging (SLR)) offers an extremely accurate\nalternative to microwave methods. It is used particu-\nlarly for geophysical satellite missions where it serves\nnot only as a means of measuring the orbit, but also\nfor the precise determination of station movements.\nThe operation of approx. 40 SLR stations worldwide\nis coordinated by the International Laser Ranging\nService (ILRS) [2.2.22].\n\nFor SLR measurements a very short laser pulse is\nbundled with a telescope and sent to the satellite, see\nFigure 2.2.16.

By aggregating\nthe return time measurements from several pulses to\naverages, the SLR stations today can achieve accuracies\nto within the range of a few millimeters.\n\nDORIS\nThe French system DORIS (Doppler Orbitography\nand Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) is based\nupon a worldwide network of radio transmitters\n(Figure 2.2.17) that transmits signals with high-fre-\nquency stability. Through comparisons to a reference\noscillator on-board the satellite, the Doppler shift, and\nwith it the orbit of the satellite, can be determined.\nAs the measurements are first made on the satellite,\nDORIS also supports on-board determination of the\norbit.\nDORIS has been developed since the 1980s espe-\ncially for the needs of altimeter missions that require\nhighly accurate orbital measurements. Individual\nDoppler measurements with DORIS achieve an accu-\nracy of about 0.5 mm/s. When performing a precise\norbit determination, the altitude of a satellite above the\nEarth can be determined to within an accuracy of 1 cm.\nAreal-time navigation system (DIODE) integrated in\nthe DORIS receiver provides the position of the satellite\nwith an accuracy of about 0.5 m [2.2.23] on-board.\n\nFigure 2.2.17: DORIS station on the island of Crozet (Source:\nC. Bricaud/IPEV).\n\nGPS\n\nGPS comprises a constellation of approximately 30 sa-\ntellites that orbit the Earth at an altitude of 20 200 km\nwith a period of 12 h [2.2.24]. The GPS system exists\nto provide users worldwide with an exact determi-\nnation of their position, velocity and time. The\nconstellation is conceived such that from every point\non Earth (and near-Earth space) at least four GPS\nsatellites can be received.\n\nAll the satellites use identical frequencies (L1:\n1575.42 MHz; L2: 1227.6 MHz), but can be distin-\nguished from one another by their characteristic \u201cfin-\ngerprint.\u201d Using the signals it receives, a GPS receiver\ncan calculate the difference between transmission and\nreception time. However, an error is introduced by\ninaccuracies in the timekeeping of the receiver. For this\nreason it is referred to as pseudo-distance measure-\nment. Additionally each GPS satellite transmits orbital\nelements that allow the determination of its current\nposition. If measurements from at least four satellites\nare available, the position and exact time can be dedu-\nced in the receiver. The current velocity of the receiver\nis also calculable from Doppler measurements.\n\nIn the mid-1980s GPS receivers were first used on\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and have established\nthemselves as an inexpensive and powerful naviga-\ntion system. In contrast to the previously described\ntracking methods, GPS receivers not only provide\nindividual position-dependent measurements, but\nmake a direct determination of the position in space\n\n2/25/09 11:03:26 AM\n",

In\ncombination with a dynamic orbit determination using\nthe elementary pseudo-distance and carrier phase\nmeasurements, much more exact orbital information\ncan be achieved.

Using differential phase measurements\nfor satellite formations, relative position accuracies in\nthe millimeter range can be determined [2.2.25].\n\n2.2.2.2 Observation Model\n\nThe goal of orbit determination (for improving the\norbit) is to minimize the variation between a modeled\norbit and observations. Section 2.2.1 described how\nthe orbit of a satellite can be represented by a series of\norbital elements or starting values, as well as by using\nvarious model parameters (e.g., radiation pressure\n\nFigure 2.2.18: Orbit determination of satellites with the help of\nthe GPS system (Source: DLR).\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:69\n\n69\n\ncoefficient or drag coefficient). Above and beyond\nthis, for comparison to actual observations a model\nof the measurement process is necessary, unless\nirect three-dimensional position measurements are\nvailable (as is the case for a GPS receiver).\n\nFor the sake of the following discussion z repre-\nents a scalar (one-dimensional) measurement that\nepends on the orbit of the satellite. Accordingly the\nfunction g(t, y(t), ...) describes the measurement\nmodel and reflects the dependence of the measured\nuantity (e.g., the distance of the satellite) from the\nmeasurement epoch \u00a3, the state vector y(t) of the satel-\nlite at epoch \u00a2, as well as other conceivable parameters\n(e.g., systematic runtime delays). Alternatively, the\nmeasurement model can also be represented using\nthe state vector yy = y(t) for a starting epoch f and\nforce model parameter p, which function, for pur-\nposes of discrimination, we refer to as h(t, yo; p, ...)\n= g(t, y(2), ...). The residual z\u2014 g or z\u2014 h describes\nhow well the modeled orbit fits the actual observations\nindependently of the chosen representation.\n\n2\n\nw\n\nfay\n\nAngle and Distance Measurements\n\nAs an example for deploying the measurement mo-\ndel the following discussion will examine the angle\nand distance measurements of a ground station. For\nthis purpose a coordinate system will be used, the\norigin of which represents the antenna base, with\nthe axes oriented to the east, north and zenith (see\nFigure 2.2.15). The position of the satellite in this\nso-called topocentric coordinate system can be\ngenerally represented in the form\n\ns = E-(U(t)-r(t)\u2014R) (2.2.42)\n\nwith R representing the coordinates of the ground\nstation in an Earth-centered system (e.g., ICRF) and U\nthe time-dependent transformation from the inertial\nto the Earth-fixed system.

To exactly\nmodel the measurement it would also be necessary to\nconsider that the satellite moves during signal propaga-\ntion. Its position at the time of reception at the ground\nstation is therefore slightly different from its position\nat the time of transmission of the signal. Additionally,\nthe signal experiences delays and deflections on its path\nthrough the atmosphere. These effects can be added\nto the measurement model through appropriate cor-\nrections without altering the basic concept.\n\n2.2.2.3 Linearization\n\nThe model functions for the motion of the satellite\nand the description of individual measurements are\ngenerally too complex to allow directly solving for\nthe x= (yo; p) unknown. It is therefore helpful to\nstudy only the effect of small offsets from a given a\npriori value.\n\nIn the case of actively operated satellites, an ap-\nproximate starting value for the state vector yp (or\nthe orbital elements) for an epoch f will be available.\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nSuch values are usually derived from predictions from\nearlier orbit determinations. Even at the start of a\nsatellite mission, approximate orbital information is\navailable based on the planned insertion orbit of the\nrocket. Likewise, meaningful starting values can also\nbe found for the model parameters p (such as radia-\ntion pressure and drag coefficient) from earlier orbit\ndeterminations or theoretical considerations.\n\nIf these starting values are defined as xref = ( yet),\nthe model function for the measurement value h can\nthen be developed in a Taylor series expanded around\nx\"! to the first order:\n\nh(t, x) = A(t, xref) + (=) .

At the same time, por-\ntions resulting from light transit time or other small\ncorrections can usually be neglected. Derivatives of the\nsatellite's velocity only occur with Doppler measure-\nments, but not for distance or angle measurements.\nFor example, for the distance measurement from a\nground station one obtains the derivatives from the\nequations in the previous paragraph\n\n$e = (2 2)\n\n2.2.47\noy or av ( )\n\n2/27/09 11:44:24 AM\n",

To limit the calculation effort, when formula-\nting the variation equations a series of simplifications\nare acceptable, for example a reduction in degree and\norder of the gravitational field.\n\n2.2.2.4 Least Squares Adjustment\n\nEstimation Problem\n\nFor parameter adjustment using the least squares\nmethod one attempts to find those model parame-\nters for which the sum of the squared differences\nis minimized between the model and observations.\nGenerally stated this is an optimization problem\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:71\n\n71\n\nthat can be reduced to an overdetermined system of\nequations through linearization around approximated\nstarting values.\n\nIn its application to orbit determination problems\nthis means that one begins by predicting the orbit\nof the satellite with the help of the starting values\nxtef= (yh!) and for each measurement time cal-\nculates the associated modeled observation. From\nthe differences between the measured and modeled\nobservations (known as residuals) and the related\npartial derivatives, a correction Ax = x\u2014 x can be\ncalculated so that the sum\n\nT= YY Zj- hilt, YP =z - GOP (2.2.50)\n\ni\n\nof the squared residuals for all observations reaches its\nsmallest possible value (Figure 2.2.19). To simplify the\nfurther representation, all observations are collected in\nthe vector z= (z;);- 1, , of the measured values and\na corresponding vector h of the modeled values.\n\nIf one only examines linear changes around the\nreference values then the task is to find the minimum\nof a quadratic function\n\nJ =|Az \u2014H Ax| = (HAx\u2014Az)?

But using the simplifications that were\nmade during linearization one rarely finds the desired\nminimum of the residual square sum in one step. The\nentire process can, however, be repeated several times\nto successively improve the result. Depending on the\nquality of the starting values, a handful of iterations\nis usually sufficient to determine the minimum of the\nresidual square sum to better than 1% of its value.\n\nIt should be noted that the solution to the estima-\ntion problem can also be calculated without matrix\ninversion directly from the linear system of equations\n(the so-called normal equations):\n\n(H? H) Ax = (H\u2122 Az) (2.2.53)\n\nTo achieve this, suitable numerical methods are availa-\nble such as Gaussian elimination or LR transformati-\non, which require significantly fewer calculations than\na matrix inversion [2.2.26], [2.2.27]. This method\nis useful when only the solution to the equalization\nproblem is required, but not when the covariance\ninformation described below is needed.\n\nWeighting\n\nIn practice, it is often the case that in the course of\norbit determination different types of observations\n(e.g., angle and distance measurements) or measure-\nments of different quality (e.g., from two different\nstations) must be processed. This circumstance can be\naccounted for easily with a suitable weighting of the\nmeasurements. If one generally assumes that the i\u2019th\nmeasurement exhibits a normally distributed error\nwith a standard deviation of oj, the optimal solution\nto the orbital determination problem results from a\nminimization of the weighted residual square sum:\n\n2\nz \u2014 hj (tex)\nJ=Q ( oj } (2.2.54)\n\n= (z \u2014 h(x)\" Wz \u2014 h(x)\n\nThe weight matrix W = diag(l/o7j,..., 1/o7;) is a\ndiagonal matrix whose elements represent the in-\nverse variance of the statistical measurement error. If\nweighting is considered when determining the mini-\nmum, one finds the following general relationship for\nthe solution of the linear adjustment problem:\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nAx = (H\u2019 W H)\"! (H! W Az) (2.2.55)\n\nCovariance of the Solution\n\nBesides the solution of the orbital determination pro-\nblem itself, for many applications the expected accuracy\nis also of great interest. For this reason, in the prepa-\nration of a mission it must be decided which ground\nstations or measurement systems are necessary to deter-\nmine the satellite orbit with a predetermined accuracy.\nThese predictions can be derived from the covariance\nmatrix. It is defined using the expected value\n\nP =E((Ax\u2014 Ax) (Ax \u2014 Ax)7) (2.2.56)\n\nand primarily describes the scatter of the solution\naround its mean.\n\nIf one views measurement errors as random va-\nriables, then the resulting solution of the adjustment\nproblem Ax itself is also a randomly distributed value.\nIn the case of normally distributed measurement\nerrors with a mean of zero, because of the linearity\nof the problem it first follows that the expected value\nAx = E (Ax) of the solution of the equalization problem\nin the mean always represents the true orbit. The orbit\ndetermination then exhibits no systematic error, as\nlong as this is also true for the measurements them-\nselves. It can further be demonstrated that the covari-\nance of the solution is represented by the matrix\n\nP= (H'\u2019 Ww H)! (2.2.57)\n\nthat was already determined to be a part of the least\nsquares adjustment problem.\n\nAs a simple measure of the accuracy of the orbit\ndetermination one can initially examine the diagonal\nelements P;;= 0\u201d (x;) of the covariance matrix. These\ncontain the squares of the standard deviation of the\nindividual estimation parameters. They represent,\nfor example, the uncertainty of the starting position\nvector or the estimated semi-major axis. These error\ncalculations only include the assumed accuracy of\nthe measurements (through the weight matrix W)\nand the type of measurement and their distribution\n(through the derivative matrix H). The covariance\nmatrix can therefore only provide statistical results\nbut does not cover the influence of individual stray\nvalues or systematic measurement errors.

As a rule it is possible\nto recognize if the orbit is well determined by the\nobservations or if individual parameters cannot be\nadequately determined due to poor distribution of\nthe observations.\n\nA priori Information\n\nIn general the number of measurements is significantly\ngreater than the number of unknowns. Principally one\nhas an overdetermined system of equations whose\nsolution is determined by the method of least squares.\nUnfortunately this overdetermination does not always\nguarantee that the values of all estimation parameters\nwere reliably estimated. For example, if one only has\nmeasurements from a single satellite flyover of the\nground station, the semi-major axis can only be fixed\ninsufficiently. If, by contrast, measurements from two\nsuccessive passes are available, then the orbital period,\nand thereby the major semiaxis, are very well determi-\nned. The quality of the orbit determination is therefore\nless dependent on simply the number of measurements\nthan on a good distribution across time and location.\nWhere this cannot be achieved, it is possible to in-\ncorporate independent information in the parameter\nestimation.

Here the result of a previous orbit determination\nis entered as a priori information in the following\norbit determination.

There, observations are no lon-\nger processed in large batches but rather epoch by\nepoch. At the same time, estimation parameters (like\n\norbital elements or state vector) do not refer to a\n\nchosen starting epoch but in each case to the time of\n\nthe last measurement. The Kalman filter is therefore\nparticularly of interest for real-time processing and is\nprimarily used in on-board navigation systems.\n\nThe Kalman filter process is composed of two\nelementary steps:\n\ne Starting from the last known value of the state\nvector and its covariance, both values are first\npredicted to the time of the next measurement in\nthe time update.\n\ne Then in the measurement update, an optimal\nestimate of the state vector and its covariance for\nthe new epoch is determined based upon this a\npriori information and current observations.\n\nBoth steps are performed successively and repeated\ncontinuously (Figure 2.2.20).\n\nx3\", P3* o \u2014\nP sens 5 Adjusted\nXo Fee Xz, Ps orbit\n\u00a9 Xp\", Pot\n\nx Py\n\n\u00b0\n+ pe\nx7, Py\n\nXo, Po\n\nFigure 2.2.20: Orbit determination using a Kalman filter.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:41 AM\n",

As\na special feature, at this point the Kalman filter offers\nthe possibility of also considering statistical errors\nin the prediction itself.

The \u201cmemory\u201d of the filter can therefore\nbe controlled by the choice of process noise and thus\nbe adapted to the obtaining circumstances. Usually,\nhowever, a series of simulations and instinct are re-\nquired to optimally use a Kalman filter.\n\nFor the most part, the measurement update of\nthe Kalman filter is equivalent to the estimation with\na priori information described in the last section.

Although the for-\nmulation of the measurement update in the Kalman\nfilter bears little resemblance to the estimation with\na priori information introduced in Section 2.2.2.4,\nthese two expressions are mathematically identical.\nHowever, the Kalman filter does not require any large\nmatrix operations for updating the estimation.\nCharacteristic of the Kalman filter is not only the\nepoch-by-epoch processing of individual measure-\nments, but also the estimation of the state vector\nonly for the current time. The Kalman filter thus\ndistinguishes itself from classical orbit determination\nusing the least squares method in which the orbital\nelements or the position and velocity are determined\nfor a chosen starting epoch. One disadvantage of se-\nquential processing is the circumstance that only past\nor current, but naturally no future, measurements are\nincluded in the estimation of the current state vector.\nBy contrast, the method of least squares provides an\noptimal fitting of all observations of a given data set.\nFor this reason it is generally preferred for the post\nfacto orbit determination on the ground where no\nserious real-time demands exist.\n\n2.2.3 Orbit Design and Station\nKeeping\n\nThe third and last section of this discussion of orbital\nmechanics deals with designing and maintaining the\n\n2/25/09 11:03:42 AM\n",

After a discussion of\nsimple maneuvers for the transfer between different\norbits, the especially important practical cases of\nSun-synchronous remote sensing satellites and geo-\nstationary communications satellites will be examined\nmore closely.\n\n2.2.3.1 Hohmann Transfer\n\nFor many applications, achieving and maintaining\na predetermined orbit is a fundamental prerequisite\nfor mission success. One example is communica-\ntions satellites which can only carry out their desired\ngeosynchronous motion at a specific altitude above\nthe equator. Remote sensing satellites must also hold\npredetermined orbital inclinations and orbit altitudes\nto maintain the required lighting conditions and\nground tracks.\n\nDue to the injection dispersion of current launch\nvehicles and inevitable orbital perturbations, a prede-\ntermined ideal orbit cannot be reached and maintained\nright away. For this reason so-called orbital maneuvers\nare used to correct variations from the nominal orbit.\nThese are performed utilizing a system of thrusters to\nmodify the velocity of the satellite v by a desired value\nAv. In the ideal case these changes are made so quickly\nthat the length of the maneuver is negligible compared\nto the orbital period. After such an impulse-type ma-\nneuver the satellite flies in a new orbit characterized\nby new orbital elements. The old and new orbits share\nthe point rat which the maneuver was carried out. As\na result of the maneuver only three orbital elements\n(or three linearly independent combinations of orbital\nelements) are changed, while the remaining orbital\nparameters remain constant. If a correction of all six\norbital elements is needed, at least two independent,\ntime-offset maneuvers are required.\n\nIt is possible to discriminate between two types\nof maneuvers. If the change in velocity Av lies in the\norbital plane, the size and form of the orbit (a, e) and\nperigee (@, M) are affected. Alternatively, inclination\nand the line of nodes (i, Q) are altered by impulses\nperpendicular to the orbital plane.\n\nImportant special cases are thrust and braking\nmaneuvers executed directly at perigee or apogee.\nIndependent of the eccentricity of a satellite\u2019s orbit, the\nmotion at the nearest and furthest point to the Earth\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:75\n\n75\n\nis always perpendicular to the radius of the orbit.

For example,\nto raise a satellite from LEO to a geostationary orbit\n(Figure 2.2.21) its velocity must first be increased\nfrom 7.7 km/s to about 10 km/s.

If the velocity\nis again increased by 1.4 km/s, the orbit is raised at\nthe opposite point and thereby achieves the desired\ncircular form.\n\nIn practice, geostationary satellites are normally\ninjected directly into the highly elliptical transfer orbit\nso that only apogee maneuvers are necessary. These are\nusually divided into several steps to keep individual\nmaneuvers short.\n\nIn the example above it might at first be mystifying\nthat two increases in velocity caused by the maneuvers\nresult in a lower orbital velocity. This paradox is exp-\nlained by the increase in potential energy achieved by\nincreasing the orbital altitude, but in no way makes an\nintuitive prediction of the effects of thrust and braking\nmaneuvers easier.\n\n2.2.3.2 Remote Sensing Satellites\n\nA large number of satellites in LEO regularly monitor\nand map the Earth\u2019s surface across a diverse spectral\nrange.

This is known\nas a \u201cSun-synchronous orbit.\u201d These factors present\nthe conditions that must be taken into account during\nmission analysis when choosing the orbit\u2019s semi-major\naxis and inclination.\n\nIf special measures were not taken, completely\ndifferent orientations of the Sun to the satellite orbit\nwould result over the course of a year. This is due both\nto the annual orbit of the Earth around the Sun and\nto the node drift caused by oblateness, the rotational\n\nTable 2.2.2: Orbital parameters\nfor various Sun-synchronous re-\nmote sensing satellites.

In one year the right ascension\nof the Sun changes by 360\u00b0. For an inertially fixed\norbit, the angle between the line of nodes and the\ndirection of the Sun projected onto the equator grows\ndaily by about 1\u00b0 (or precisely 0.985 647\u00b0). When plan-\nning the orbit of a remote sensing satellite one can use\nthe circumstance that the orbital plane itself exhibits\nprograde (meaning forward-facing) rotation when\nhe orbital inclination is greater than 90\u00b0. With an in-\nclination of approx. 98\u00b0, the daily node drift for orbits\nbetween 700 and 900 km altitude is just high enough\nhat they balance out the change in the direction of\nhe Sun. Such Sun-synchronous orbits make possible\n(nearly) constant lighting conditions when flying over\nareas of the same geographic latitude. In particular,\nSun-synchronous orbits distinguish themselves by\nalways passing over the equator at the same local time.\nAs an example, a local time of 10:30 is common. This\nensures a sufficiently high position of the Sun (and\nwith it enough light for the photographic exposure)\nwhile producing enough shadows to guarantee con-\ntrast-rich photographs. By nature, Sun-synchronous\nsatellites travel along nearly polar orbits. They also\nenjoy nearly optimal coverage of a large portion of the\nEarth.

Deviations from an\nideal circular orbit are described by the eccentricity\nvector:\n\ney cos(Q + w)\ne= =e.

The other elements\nwould be zero for a geosynchronous circular orbit in\nthe plane of the equator.\n\nIn reality this can never be achieved since various\nperiodic and long-term perturbations continually\nchange the orbit [2.2.32], [2.2.33]:\n\ne The irregular form of the Earth causes a slow ac-\nceleration of a geostationary satellite along its orbit.\nThe magnitude and sign of this acceleration depend\non the satellite\u2019s location above the equator.

These perturbations\nare caused by the attraction of the Sun and Moon\nwhich impart a constant torque on the satellite\norbit and so change the orbit normal.\n\nIn accordance with international agreements, most\ngeostationary satellites must be kept in a narrow\nwindow whose magnitude in geographical longitude\nand latitude may not exceed +0.1\u00b0.

To prevent this, orbital control maneu-\nvers are carried out in a regular cycle of about two\nweeks. North-south maneuvers serve to control the\ninclination vector (the orbital plane), and east-west\nmaneuvers steer the eccentricity and drift of the\nsatellite.\n\nThe effect of impulsive maneuvers in radial (R),\neasterly (E) and northerly (N) directions on the orbital\nelements of a geostationary satellite are described toa\nfirst approximation by the equations [2.2.34].\n\n2/25/09 11:03:46 AM\n",

This\nentails a small daily periodic oscillation of the satellite\nwith an amplitude of 0.011\u00b0 in an east-west direction.\nTo control the longitude, in this case a simple west\nmaneuver of 8 cm/s is sufficient. This slightly reduces\nthe semi-major axis and causes a drift to the east,\nwhich is later canceled out by the natural perturba-\ntion of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. Near the end\nof the 14-day station-keeping cycle, an additional\nnorth maneuver of 2 m/s is carried out to compen-\nsate for the drift of the inclination vector under the\ninfluence of the Sun and Moon. The inclination of\nthe satellite orbit relative to the plane of the equator\nand therefore the daily latitude variation can thus be\nheld to under 0.05\u00b0.\n\nFor a more detailed account of maneuver plan-\nning for geostationary satellites referral to the ap-\npropriate textbooks ([2.2.32], [2.2.33]) and articles\n([2.2.34], [2.2.35]) is necessary. It must be stated\nthat no consistent notation for the orbital elements\nof geostationary satellites has been established in the\nliterature. This leads to confusion, particularly in the\ncase of the inclination vector, as here two categorically\ndifferent conventions (with axes rotated 90\u00b0 to each\nother) are in use.\n\nFinally, the question of colocating several geo-\nstationary satellites in one control window deserves\nmention. This can best be achieved by separating\nthe eccentricity and inclination vectors, as was first\nsuggested in 1989 for the TDF-1/-2 and TVSat-2\nsatellites. The e/i vector separation allows a safe\nseparation of several satellites and is particularly\nrobust against errors that occur when carrying out\nmaneuvers. This is achieved by aligning the relative\nperigee and line of nodes of each satellite pair so\nthat a separation in the radial and normal direction\nis always guaranteed. One impressive example is the\npositioning of up to eight ASTRA satellites at 19.2\u00b0E,\ndescribed in [2.2.37].\n\nBibliography\n\n[2.2.1] Vallado, D.A.

Before the\nflight of the Soviet Sputnik 1 in 1957, representing the\nfirst artificial satellite in an Earth orbit, no textbook\nrelating to aerothermodynamics and reentry strategies\nwas available. Since then, however, numerous books\nhave been published and every year several conferences\nfocus on this topic. The discussion of aerothermody-\nnamics and reentry presented here is condensed to an\noverview of the driving physical and chemical pheno-\nmena and provides basic relations and correlations. Re-\nferences allowing a more detailed study of this complex\ntopic are given at the end of this section.\n\n2.3.1 Introduction\n\nAerothermodynamics can be regarded as an extension\nof classical aerodynamics of flight vehicles toward\nhigher velocities. While classical aerodynamics is\nmostly concerned with aircraft flying at speeds in the\norder of the speed of sound, aerothermodynamics\nanalyzes the flight properties at several times the speed\nof sound. Although no well-defined boundary exists,\nflows at Mach numbers M =v/a (v and a denote the\nflight speed and the speed of sound, respectively) of\nM 2 5 are generally referred to as hypersonic flows.\nDuring the reentry flight of a space vehicle into the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere velocities exceeding 25 times the\nspeed of sound are reached.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:48 AM\n",
    "104": "2.3. Aerothermodynamics and Reentry\n\nWith increasing flight velocity, the energy content\nof the flow increases and the heating of the space\nvehicle and the surrounding air become more and\nmore important. Consequently, aerodynamics must be\nextended to account for thermodynamic aspects, thus\ngenerating a new discipline called aerothermodyna-\nmics. Similar effects as observed during reentry occur\nin the framework of interplanetary missions when a\nspacecraft enters the sufficiently dense atmosphere of\nanother planet. One of the substantial differences is\nthe composition of the atmospheres. In comparison to\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which consists of 78% nitro-\ngen, 21% oxygen and 1% noble gases (mostly argon)\nby volume, the atmosphere of Mars for example is\nmade up of 95% carbon dioxide by volume as well as\na 5% fraction composed of nitrogen, argon and, to\na smaller extent, oxygen and carbon monoxide. The\nfollowing discussions are restricted to entry into the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe reentry of a spacecraft is essentially a braking\nmaneuver to slow down the vehicle from its orbital\nspeed for a safe landing. From an economic as well as\na technical point of view, the only way to realize this\nbraking maneuver for vehicles of the size typical for\nhuman space missions is to utilize aerodynamic forces\nand control surfaces. Along its reentry flight path a\nspacecraft is exposed to different flow environments\nwhose dominating fluid mechanical and chemical\nprocesses vary strongly. In addition to the correct\ntreatment of these phenomena, the investigation of\nthe aerothermodynamics of a spacecraft is closely\nlinked to a number of additional disciplines such as\nflight mechanics or structural mechanics and is thus a\nmultidisciplinary undertaking. The aerothermodyna-\nmic properties of a vehicle determine its aerodynamic\nbehavior, and are used to select the flight path and\nsuitable materials for the thermal protection system.\n\nGround-based testing facilities, including a large\nvariety of different measurement techniques, nume-\nrical prediction methods and flight tests, are used as\ntools to determine aerothermodynamic data.\n\n2.3.2 Global Energy Considerations\n\nDue to the extremely high velocities and the resulting\nkinetic energy of spacecraft, the aerodynamic braking\nmaneuver in the atmosphere initially appears to be\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:83\n\n83\n\nalmost impossible. A simple estimation of the orbital\nvelocity results from equating the centrifugal force\nwith the gravitational force. The velocity in a low Earth\norbit is then given by (see also Section 2.2)\n\nY= gh (it Re) ~ 18h Re (2.3.1)\nwhere:\n\nVu = speed in orbit [m/s],\n\ngi, = acceleration due to gravity in orbit [m/s\u201d],\nh, = flight altitude [m],\n\nRg = radius of the Earth [m].\n\nBased on this relation, the velocity of the Inter-\nnational Space Station (ISS) at a flight altitude of\nhy = 400 km is vy = 7.9 km/s. Were the complete\namount of kinetic energy e,;,, during reentry from the\nISS to be absorbed by the thermal protection system\nof the spacecraft, this would result in a maximum\nintegral specific heat quantity of\n\nGw = kin = a/2 = 31 MI/kg (2.3.2)\n\nA comparison of this heat quantity to that necessary\nto melt or vaporize some of the elements which are\ntypically used for spacecraft (Table 2.3.1) indicates\nthat none of the elements shown would withstand\nsuch high thermal loads. Regarding pure carbon, it\nshould be noted that while it sublimes at a rather high\ntemperature, it would burn in the atmosphere.\n\nAn estimation of the temperature in the stagnation\nregion of a spacecraft, assuming that the air behaves\nlike a calorically perfect gas, results in\n\nTable 2.3.1: Energy necessary to melt or vaporize different\nelements.\n\nElement Heat of Heat of Melting\nfusion vaporization _ point\n[MJ/kg] [M3/kg] [kK]\nAluminum 0.40 10.9 933\nTungsten 0.19 4.5 3695\nTitanium 0.32 8.8 1941\nMolybdenum 0.41 6.2 2896\nSilicon 1.8 13.6 1683\nBeryllium 1.35 32.44 1551\nCarbon - 59.5 3820\n\n2/25/09 11:03:48 AM\n",

Because of the high-temperature environment,\nthe translational energy of the air particles reaches\na level causing the energy exchange during particle\ncollisions to be high enough to generate so-called\nhigh-temperature effects. These will be discussed in\nmore detail in the following section.\n\nThe global consequence of these endothermic pro-\ncesses is a strong reduction of the gas temperature in\nthe stagnation region. This discussion reveals already\nthat in reality the complete energy which is converted\ninto heat during the braking maneuver is not absorbed\nby the structure of the spacecraft. A large fraction of\nthe energy is absorbed by the air in the vicinity of the\nvehicle and subsequently carried away by the flow. Ina\nfirst approximation, the fraction of the kinetic energy\nwhich is involved in the heating of the vehicle\u2019s surface\ndue to friction is [2.3.1]\n\nQy = 1/2+ (Cl Cy) 12+ m-v2 (2.3.4)\n\nwhere:\n\nQ,, = integral heat quantity [J],\n\nC;= averaged vehicle skin friction coefficient\n[dimensionless],\n\nCy = drag coefficient [dimensionless],\n\nm= vehicle mass [kg].\n\nThis relationship shows that the integral heat quan-\ntity which is emitted to the surface depends on the\nkinetic energy of the vehicle in orbit and the ratio\nof viscous drag to total drag, consisting of pressure\ndrag and viscous drag. Since the viscous drag of tur-\nbulent boundary layers is approximately 2-3 times\nlarger than that of laminar boundary layers, the\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nlaminar-turbulent transition should be delayed as\nmuch as possible during the flight path in order to\nreduce viscous drag. Further, it is clear that vehicles\nwith a pressure drag predominating the viscous drag\nexperience a smaller integral heat load.\n\nThe dependence of the integral heat quantity on\nthe viscous drag appearing in the above estimate is\nused here as an opportunity to additionally refer to a\ngeneral relationship of practical importance. In 1875,\nReynolds identified an analogy between the transport\nof momentum, energy and mass. This analogy states\nthat for boundary layer flows of fluids with Pr = Sc\n= 1 and zero pressure gradient along the surface, the\nStanton number, representing the nondimensiona-\nlized wall heat flux q,,.5 (see also Section 2.3.4), can\nbe determined by\n\nSt=C,/ 2,\nwhere:\n\nPr= Prandtl number, Pr = p \u201cok [dimensionless],\n\nSc = Schmidt number, Sc = yp / (p - D) [dimension-\nless],\n\n= dynamic viscosity [N s/m\u2019],\n\nk= thermal conductivity [W/(m - K)],\n\np = density [kg/m\u2019],\n\nD = diffusion coefficient [m\u2019/s],\n\nSt= Stanton number, St = qw,gas/(Poo \u2018Veo (ho-My))\n[dimensionless],\n\nGw,gas = Wall heat flux [Wim\u2019],\n\nho = total specific enthalpy [J/kg],\n\nh,, = wall specific enthalpy [J/kg].\n\nExtensions of this relationship for flows which do not\nmeet the above-mentioned requirements are given, for\nexample, in [2.3.2].\n\n2.3.3 Fluid Mechanical and Chemical\nPhenomena during Reentry\n\nThe overview in Figure 2.3.1 summarizes the most\nimportant fluid mechanical and chemical processes\nwhich occur during reentry of a spacecraft in the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere.

A flow is considered\nto be a free molecular flow if the distance A traveled\nby an air particle between two consecutive collisions\nis several times larger than this characteristic length.\nDue to the decreasing density of the atmosphere with\naltitude, the orbiter of the Space Shuttle is located\nin this regime in flight altitudes above 150 km. In\nthe Knudsen number regime Kn < 0.01, the flow is\nconsidered to be a continuum flow; that is, the mean\nfree path is significantly smaller than the characteristic\nlength. Due to the different number of particles which\nhit a spacecraft in the different regimes, the aerody-\nnamic properties change and the set of equations\nrequired for the mathematical description of the flow\nneeds to be adapted accordingly (e.g., [2.3.2]; see also\nSection 2.3.7).\n\nDuring the aerothermodynamic design process\n\nof a hypersonic vehicle, viscous effects are a key\nfactor. The heat flux at the surface of blunt reentry\nconfigurations is of particular practical importance\nand will subsequently be addressed in more detail.\nThe parameter which characterizes the influence of\nviscous effects on a flow field is the Reynolds number,\nRe=p-v-L/p.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:50 AM\n",
    "107": "CHO2.indd Sec1:86\n\n86\n\nAs indicated in Figure 2.3.2, the Reynolds number\nvaries over several orders of magnitude along a reentry\ntrajectory. In high-altitude flight the wall boundary\nlayer of a reentry vehicle is initially laminar. After\nexceeding a critical Reynolds number, the transition\nfrom a laminar to a turbulent boundary layer takes\nplace. This process is linked with an increase of the\nskin friction and, according to the Reynolds analogy,\nan increase of the wall heat flux.\n\nThe high-energy content of reentry flows leads to\nstrong heating of the air in the vicinity of a spacecraft.\nThe resulting high-temperature effects occurring\nbehind the bow shock wave developing in front of a\nreentry vehicle are schematically shown in Figure 2.3.3.\nIn the nose region of the configuration the bow shock\n\n120\n\nRelL [1/m]\n\n5000\n\nvimis] 10000\n\nFigure 2.3.2: Variation of Mach and Reynolds numbers (based on\na reference length of 1 m) along a typical reentry corridor.\n\nBow shock\n\nT210000 K\n\nFigure 2.3.3: Overview of the fundamental high-temperature effects\noccurring in the shock layer in front of a reentry vehicle.\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nhas its highest strength and the temperature increase\nacross the shock reaches a maximum. Depending on\nthe temperature level behind the shock wave, the vi-\nbrational degrees of freedom of the air molecules are\nexcited (1) and dissociation reactions of oxygen and\nnitrogen molecules may occur (2). With increasing\ntemperature in the bow shock region, gas radiation\n(3) adds to spacecraft heating. Further, ionization of\nthe air constituents (4) occurs, which leads to the so-\ncalled \u201cblack-out\u201d effect, namely a disruption of radio\ncommunications between the ground control station\nand the spacecraft. The high-temperature effects de-\nscribed here are enabled by energy transfer from the\ntranslational energy stored in the random motion of\nthe air particles, which is increased by the gas heating,\nto other forms of energy. Because this energy transfer\nis realized by air particle collisions, it requires a certain\ntime period to develop. The time required to reach an\nequilibrium condition, which, for example, is defined\nby the local temperature and density, is called the re-\nlaxation time. Whether this condition can be reached\ndepends on the Damk\u00e9hler number D = t;/ tp .\n\nIn the case D > 1, the characteristic time scale of\nthe flow, that is the residence time f, of a particle in\na certain flow environment, is large compared to the\nrelaxation time tg and the flow is in equilibrium. The\nother limiting case D \u00ab 1 characterizes a frozen flow\nbecause no relaxation processes can advance and D = 1\ndescribes a flow in nonequilibrium.\n\nFrom Figure 2.3.1 it can be seen that during reent-\nry regimes occur in which the flow can be in nonequili-\nbrium or equilibrium regarding the thermal excitation\n(of internal degrees of freedom such as vibration) and\nchemical relaxation.\n\nThe influence of chemical reactions on the flow\ntopology in the case of a reentry capsule is demons-\ntrated in Figure 2.3.4. The depicted Mach number\ndistribution in the symmetry plane and the skin fric-\ntion lines result from numerical computations of the\nthree-dimensional viscous flow past the capsule confi-\nguration within the framework of the European flight\nexperiment \u201cAtmospheric Reentry Demonstrator\u201d\n(ARD). The reentry flight experiment was performed\nin 1998 using the Ariane 5 launcher [2.3.3]. In order\nto clarify the influence of chemical reactions, the flow\npast the ARD capsule was computed for a flight Mach\nnumber M = 24 at an altitude of 65 km assuming\n\n2/25/09 11:03:51 AM\n",

The difference in flow topology between\nboth solutions is self-evident. A characteristic feature\nof high enthalpy hypersonic flows past blunt bodies\nis that compared to the frozen flow the shock stand-\noff distance is significantly reduced due to chemical\nreactions and the associated increase in shock layer\ndensity. This results in a lower surface pressure level\nand hence lower forces and moments in the case of the\nfrozen flow. For the example shown in Figure 2.3.4 the\naerodynamic coefficients differ by 50% for the pitching\nmoment, 20% for the lift and 5% for the drag.\n\nDepending on the properties of the vehicle sur-\nface, the energy stored in the form of dissociation\nenergy in the atoms can be released again at the\nsurface, causing additional heating. This would be\nthe case for a catalytic surface, that is a surface at\nwhich recombination reactions take place (see (5) in\nFigure 2.3.3) [2.3.5]. For a noncatalytic surface this\nadditional heating does not occur. As a consequence,\nfor thermal protection systems for spacecraft, mate-\nrials are selected which preferably have noncatalytic\nproperties [2.3.6]. Examples are silicon carbide (SiC),\nwhich is highly temperature resistant (sublimation\ntemperature ~ 2900 K) and for a ceramic material\nhighly heat conductive, or the composite material\ncarbon-silicon carbide (C-SiC).\n\nThe results of computations taking into ac-\ncount chemical nonequilibrium in the flow past the\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:87\n\n87\n\nhyperboloid depicted in Figure 2.3.5 suggest that com-\npared to a fully catalytic wall the heat flux in the sta-\ngnation point of a reentry configuration can be 50%\nlower for noncatalytic walls [2.3.7]. The geometry\nof the hyperboloid has been chosen such that for an\naxisymmetric free stream, the flow conditions along\nthe windward symmetry line of the Space Shuttle\nOrbiter are approximately reproduced. The numeri-\ncal and flight data correspond to a Mach number of\nM= 27 at an altitude of approximately 86 km. Com-\nparison of measured and computed data indicates\nthat the properties of the thermal protection system\nof the Space Shuttle Orbiter change at approximately\nx = 3m from partially catalytic to fully catalytic. In\nthis region, however, the absolute value of the wall\nheat flux is already strongly reduced.\n\nFurther discussions of the phenomena addressed\nin this section can be found, for example, in [2.3.2],\n[2.3.6], [2.3.8] or [2.3.9].\n\n2.3.4 Heat Flux Balance\n\nThe heat flux balance on the surface of a vehicle flying\nat hypersonic speed can be described as follows:\n\ngas,cond + Agas,diff + Igas,rad ~ Iw,rad = Iw (2.3.5)\n\nThe heat flux into the surface structure of a vehicle\n4w is composed of contributions resulting from heat\n\nO _ Space Shuttle Orbiter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Noncatalytic wall\nPartially catalytic wall y|\nceeeee Fully catalytic wall\n\nFigure 2.3.5: Influence of the wall catalysis on the heat flux of a\ngeneric reentry configuration at M = 27 at 86 km altitude.\n\n2/25/09 11:03:52 AM\n",

For\nan optically thin gas, that is a gas which solely emits\nand does not absorb radiation, and assuming that the\ndistance of the bow shock which develops in front of\nthe spacecraft is small compared to the nose radius,\nthe wall heat flux contribution is given by\ngas,rad = Eyaq/2+R- (poo!

For silicon carbide, for example, the emissivity is\n\u20ac ~ 0.9. Heat radiation of the wall is a very efficient\npassive cooling system. During reentry, approximately\n80% of the wall heat flux generated by the braking\nmaneuver of the vehicle is radiated from the surface\nand subsequently carried away by the flow.\n\nIn addition to radiation cooling, further possi-\nbilities exist to passively cool spacecraft. These are\nqualitatively discussed in the following. The heat sink\nis a technique in which absorbed heat is stored in a\nbody without causing material damage. In this context\nheat storage vessels in the form of, for instance, air\nchambers or water reservoirs are applied. Ablation\ncooling is used in the case of very high thermal loads.\nHere, the heat generated by the braking maneuver is\ndissipated by endothermic decomposition, melting\nand vaporization of the heat shield. The layer genera-\nted by the molten and vaporized surface material acts\nas a thermal protection system and avoids high heat\nfluxes onto the spacecraft. Materials used for ablation\ncooling are characterized by high melting points, high\nheats of fusion, high heats of vaporization and low\nheat conductivity. Examples of ablative thermal pro-\ntection system materials are fiber-reinforced plastic or\ngraphite. Ablation cooling results in the consumption\nof the thermal protection system material. Due to\nthe extremely high thermal loads occurring during\ninterplanetary missions, from a technical point of\nview this kind of cooling is the only feasible solution.\nDuring entry into the atmosphere of Jupiter, the\ncapsule of the Galileo spacecraft reached a velocity\nof approximately 50-60 - 10\u00b0 m/s whereby during the\nheating process the ablative carbon fiber-reinforced\nthermal protection system reached temperatures of\nup to 8800 K.\n\nIn order to select a thermal protection system for\na spacecraft it is necessary to know the planned flight\ntrajectory (Section 2.3.5). As shown in Figure 2.3.7,\nduring reentry of two different types of spacecraft a\nsimilar integral local heat flux into the structure can\noccur. However, both types experience quite different\nmaximum loads. The integral local heat flux is given\n\n2/25/09 11:03:58 AM\n",

From the equations given above, the complete\nflight trajectory, that is the velocity as a function of\nthe flight altitude, the maximum deceleration, the\naltitude at which the maximum deceleration occurs,\netc., can be determined [2.3.1], [2.3.11].\n\nIn Figure 2.3.10, the qualitative variation of some\nrelevant flow parameters along a reentry path is plot-\nted. In addition to the density and the velocity, the\nquantities p - V\u2019 and p - v\u2019 are given here, which are\nof great importance for aerodynamic and heat flux\nconsiderations. From the definition of aerodynamic\ndrag it is apparent that it scales with p-v\u2019 . The\nnondimensionalized heat flux caused by heat conduc-\ntion and diffusion in the gas is given by the Stanton\nnumber (see Section 2.3.2). Using the common hy-\npersonic approximation for the specific total enthalpy\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:91\n\n91\n\nhy = V2, /2, and hy > hy, yields vigas = 2+ Pao * v,\nSt. Note that the heat flux scales with p - v\u2019. The plots\nin Figure 2.3.10 clearly show that both quantities,\nnamely the drag which causes a load on the vehicle\nstructure as well as the heat flux, pass through a ma-\nximum during reentry. During the design of reentry\nvehicles it is important to ensure that the maxima\nof structural and thermal loads do not appear at the\nsame flight altitude.\nFor reasons of economy, the reentry flights realized\nup to now are based on vehicles without propulsion\nsystems. The possible reentry corridor of a vehicle is\nlimited by two trajectories, namely the undershoot\nand the overshoot trajectory. The overshoot trajectory\nis typically defined as the one with the shallowest\nallowable angle of entry at the atmospheric interface\nrequired to prevent skip-off. The undershoot trajecto-\nry is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory.\nTwo basically different kinds of reentry trajectories\nused so far can be distinguished. On the one hand\nthere is the ballistic flight path as employed by the\nApollo capsules and which is still flown by the Soyuz\ncapsules. As already mentioned above, a ballistic flight\npath is defined by the spacecraft generating no lift.\nStrictly speaking, this does not completely apply to the\ncapsules mentioned here; however, the lift generated\n\npv pw\n\nFigure 2.3.10: Typical variation of different flow parameters along\na reentry path.\n\n2/25/09 11:04:00 AM\n",
    "113": "CHO2.indd Sec1:92\n\n92\n\nis so slight that the flown trajectory is very close to a\nballistic one. Ballistic trajectories are in general very\nsteep (undershoot trajectory). They are determined\nby the maximum acceptable deceleration for human\nmissions and the tolerable thermal and mechanical\nloads. In the framework of human missions, accele-\nrations during the braking maneuver of 10 times the\nacceleration of gravity are regarded as an upper limit.\nSpace transportation systems which fly nearly ballistic\ntrajectories utilize blunt capsule configurations, ab-\nlative thermal protection systems and parachutes for\nthe landing approach. A disadvantage of this type of\ntrajectory is that the cross-range capability, namely\nthe range normal to the orbiting plane, is limited. On\nthe other hand, lift-generating reentry configurations\nallow for a significantly less steep trajectory, which\nsimultaneously leads to a reduction of the maximum\nheat fluxes (see Figure 2.3.7). This type of reentry\ntrajectory is flown, for example, by the Space Shuttle\nOrbiter. Further advantages of a lifting trajectory are\na larger cross-range capability and improved landing\naccuracy.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, an important parameter\nfor the characterization of reentry trajectories is the\nlift/drag ratio. In addition to the flight range and\ncross-range capability, the selection of the possible\npoint in time to commence the deorbit maneuver,\nthat is to begin the reentry phase, is determined by\nthis parameter. Particularly from a safety point of\nview, this is an important issue. In Figure 2.3.11, the\nwaiting time between two consecutive possible deorbit\nmaneuvers preparatory to reentry and landing at a\npredefined location on Earth is given as a function\nof the lift/drag ratio and the orbit inclination. The\nwaiting time is drastically reduced with increasing\nlift/drag ratio. Spacecraft with low lift/drag ratio\n\u2014 primarily capsule configurations \u2014are able to return\nto a defined landing point only once in 24 hours.\nWith a lift/drag ratio of C,/ Cy~ 2, the Space Shuttle\nOrbiter has several opportunities to return to Earth\nin the course of a day. In order to be able to reach any\npoint on Earth from a given orbit, the cross-range\nbased on the radius of the orbit must be at least m /2.\nTo achieve this, a configuration would need a ratio of\nCy/ Cy= 3.5 [2.3.12].\n\nThe criteria defining the boundaries of the reent-\nry corridor of a lift-generating configuration are\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\n25 C,/Cy = Constant = 0.65\n\u00a3 20\n2\nfe}\no\u00a3\n\u00a315\noO\n\u00a3\n2 10\n& 2.7 241\n= 5 j\n3.6\n30 60 90\nOrbit inclination [\u00b0]\nEquatorial Polar\norbit orbit\n\nFigure 2.3.11: Waiting time between two consecutive possible\ndeorbit maneuvers as a function of the lift/drag ratio and the\norbit inclination.\n\ndepicted in Figure 2.3.12. The upper boundary is\ndetermined by the aerodynamic properties of the\nvehicle, that is the lift/drag ratio. The lower boundary\nis specified by the maximum heat flux at high flight\nvelocities, the maximum acceleration load for the\ncrew during the breaking maneuver at medium ve-\nlocities, and the structural load limit of the vehicle\nat low velocities.\n\nReentry vehicles with large lift/drag ratios are\ndifficult to realize because they would exhibit a low\nvolumetric efficiency (ratio of surface to volume).\nFrom Figure 2.3.13 it is clear that configurations\nsuch as capsules or sphere/cone/cylinders with high\nvolumetric efficiencies are characterized by low lift/\ndrag ratios. In addition, Figure 2.3.13 suggests that\nfor reentry configurations lift/drag ratios above 3 are\ndifficult to achieve.\n\nA further important facet of the design of hyperso-\nnic configurations is of course aerodynamic stability.\nRegarding this aspect, reference is made here to the\ncorresponding special literature (e.g., [2.3.1], [2.3.11])\nfor a more detailed discussion.\n\n2.3.6 Aerodynamic Considerations\n\nSome relationships for the determination of aero-\ndynamic loads are presented here based on so-called\n\n2/25/09 11:04:00 AM\n",

The application of these\nmethods is restricted to the determination of aerody-\nnamic parameters of spacecraft flying at hypersonic\nspeeds and 10\u00b0-50\u00b0 angles of attack. This is the most\nimportant regime for reentry configurations which are\ncharacterized by a lift/drag ratio of C,/Cy = 1-3. For\nsignificantly lower velocities and angles of attack, the\ndetermination of aerodynamic forces is more complex\nand cannot be addressed in this section.\n\nThe aerodynamic forces and moments acting on\na vehicle primarily depend on its shape. For hyper-\nsonic flight, the resulting pressure distribution on a\nbody can be assessed by simple engineering models.\nAs already mentioned, flows at high Mach number\nare characterized by the total specific enthalpy\u2019s\nbeing approximately equal to the specific kinetic\nenergy and the static enthalpy\u2019s being negligible.\nWhen this is assumed, the force exerted by the flow\non a surface is caused solely by the kinetic energy of\nthe flow particles. A corresponding mathematical\nflow model was developed by Isaac Newton (see,\ne.g., [2.3.2]), albeit for flows at low Mach number,\nwhere these assumptions do not apply. It states that\nthe flow particles lose their momentum normal to a\nsurface when impinging on it and that they subse-\nquently move in a surface tangential direction. With\nthis assumption, the nondimensionalized difference\nbetween the surface pressure and the static pressure\nof the oncoming flow can be expressed by the relati-\nonship (Srepresents the angle between a surface and\nthe free stream velocity)\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:93\n\n93\n\nVol. efficiency sphere\n1.0 Vol. efficiency 8.0\n\n@\n\nOo\n\n10.0 Wi(Cy.S) [kN/m?} 20.0\n\nFigure 2.3.13: Lift/drag ratio and volumetric efficiency of diffe-\nrent configurations based on that of a sphere, as a function of the\nballistic coefficient.\n\nC, =k: sin\u2019 6 (2.3.14)\n\nIn Newton\u2019s original theory k = 2 was used for the\nform factor.

A second aspect which becomes\napparent from Figure 2.3.15 is the Mach number inde-\npendence principle of hypersonic flows. As long as the\nratio of specific heats y of the gas remains constant,\nthe pressure coefficient is independent of the Mach\nnumber from approximately M~ 7 [2.3.13]. As acon-\nsequence, lift and pressure drag are also independent\nof the Mach number.\n\nThe method to determine the surface pressure\ndiscussed so far can only be applied in the continuum\nregime of the trajectory, that is in a flight altitude range\nbelow approximately 90 km, where relatively high\ndynamic pressures act on a vehicle. The determination\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nof aerodynamic coefficients in the rarefied flow regime\nis only possible with numerical methods such as the\ndirect simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method (see\nSection 2.3.7) or in suitable wind tunnels, so-called\nvacuum wind tunnels [2.3.14], [2.3.9]. Due to the low\ndynamic pressure at high altitudes, vehicle control is\nonly possible using small attitude thrusters because\naerodynamic control devices do not operate efficiently\nin this flow regime. A quick engineering approach\nto determine the aerodynamic coefficients along a\ncomplete reentry trajectory is to apply semi-empirical\nbridging functions between the rarefied and continu-\num flow regimes. These bridging functions are derived\nfrom computations or measured data. In Figure 2.3.16,\nan example of this approach is schematically shown\nfor the description of the lift/drag ratio of a vehicle in\nthe flight altitude range of 50-200 km. The bridging\nfunction asymptotically approaches the free molecular\nvalue (right limit computed by DSMC) as well as the\nlift/drag ratio determined by the Newton method for\nthe continuum flow regime (left limit).\n\nNeglecting viscous effects, the forces acting on a\ncomplete configuration are determined by integra-\ntion of the wall pressure over the entire surface. A\ncharacteristic property of hypersonic flight is that\nin contrast to transonic and low supersonic flight,\nthe lower surface is particularly responsible for the\ngeneration of lift. This is due to the high pressures\noccurring there. Consequently, an inclined flat plate\nwould in practice be the most effective lower surface\nfor a reentry vehicle.

In spite of the simplifying assumptions un-\nderlying the Newton method, this value represents a\nrealistic estimate which is in the range of angles of\nattack at which actual lift-generating reentry vehicles\nreach the maximum lift coefficient.\n\nIn contrast to the considerations related to the heat\nflux into the structure of a reentry vehicle, viscous\neffects play an inferior role related to the aerodynamic\nproperties of such vehicles. Regarding the pressure\ndrag, fundamental differences between hypersonic\nand subsonic flight can be identified. In subsonic\nflight, the pressure drag is significantly determined\nby the size of the wake, whereas for supersonic and\nhypersonic vehicles the shape of the nose represents\nthe determining factor. From a drag reduction point\nof view, vehicles designed for subsonic flight are\nequipped with tapered trailing edges, and supersonic\nand hypersonic configurations with pointed leading\nedges. These considerations demonstrate the basic\ndependencies and are predominantly valid for hyper-\nsonic aircraft designed to achieve a certain flight range.\nIt should be noted that, due to the thermal balance\nand the thermal limits of currently applied materi-\nals, blunt-shaped nose parts are chosen for reentry\nvehicles. Another aspect is related to the shape of the\nwing. Straight leading edges are preferred in subsonic\night, because they generate lower induced drag and\nhigher lift. Hypersonic vehicles with high lift/drag\nratio, however, exhibit swept-back geometries with\nsharp leading edges. The delta wing shape with round\nleading edges, as used on the Space Shuttle Orbiter,\nrepresents a compromise which allows sufficient lift\nto be generated at low speed, to achieve a satisfactory\nift/drag ratio at hypersonic speeds and to meet the\nrequirements of thermal balance [2.3.2], [2.3.15]. The\nposition of the aerodynamic center on a delta wing\ndepends on the flight Mach number. While in subsonic\night the aerodynamic center is located at half of the\nchord of the wing, it is located in the center of the\nwing area in hypersonic flight. The latter results from\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:95\n\n95\n\nthe fact that the pressure is almost constant along the\nlower side of the wing. This discussion emphasizes that\nthe design of a hypersonic aircraft or reentry vehicle\nwhich ought to be able to land on a conventional run-\nway must satisfy conflicting requirements regarding\noptimum aerodynamics in subsonic and hypersonic\nflight [2.3.12].

As flight tests provide the most realistic\nconditions for the generation of experimental data,\nthey are of great importance for the development\nprocess [2.3.16]. However, hypersonic and reentry\nflight experiments are very complex, generally ex-\npensive, and their repetition rate is low. For these\nreasons, the main sources of aerothermodynamic\ndata are wind tunnel experiments and numerical\ncomputations.\n\nThe experimental investigation of hypersonic and\nreentry flows in ground-based tests is performed at\na variety of different types of facilities. The reason is\nthe large range of flow conditions and phenomena\nencountered in hypersonic flight and the fact that\nno single facility can simulate all relevant flow pa-\nrameters simultaneously. Therefore, in hypersonic\ntesting, the principle of partial simulation is applied.\nThis implies that different flow phenomena are stu-\ndied at different types of facilities. Examples are\nMach-Reynolds number simulation in cold hyper-\nsonic ground-based test facilities, verification and\nqualification of hot structures of space vehicles in\narc-heated test facilities, or the investigation of the\ninfluence of chemically reacting flows past reentry\nvehicles on their aerodynamic behavior in shock tun-\nnels. Comprehensive overviews of the ground-based\ntesting of hypersonic flows are given in, for example,\n[2.3.17], [2.3.18] or [2.3.19].\n\nAn aspect which exemplifies the partial simu-\nlation is that one possibility to increase the Mach\nnumber in ground-based facilities is to reduce the\nfree stream temperature, that is the free stream speed\nof sound. Although in these cold hypersonic testing\nfacilities flight Mach numbers can be reproduced,\nthe free stream velocity in the test section is signifi-\ncantly lower than the actual flight velocity (see Figure\n2.3.18 and Figure 2.3.19). However, as pointed out in\nSection 2.3.3, one characteristic of hypersonic flight\nat high Mach number is that the kinetic energy of\nthe flow is large enough that, in the shock layer of\nreentry vehicles, for instance, high-temperature ef-\nfects such as vibrational excitation or dissociation of\nthe fluid molecules is induced.

Consequently, the smaller the\nscale of the wind tunnel model, the higher the free\nstream density or pressure in the facility test section.\nThe highest local heat flux occurs at a point in the\nreentry flight trajectory at about 70 km altitude with\nan associated atmospheric density of approximately\n10 * kg/m\u2019. Scaling the vehicle down by a factor of\n30, a free stream density in the ground-based facility\nof 0.003 kg/m? is required. If a flow with this free\nstream density and a velocity of 6000 m/s is generated\nby expansion in a convergent\u2014divergent hypersonic\nnozzle from a reservoir at rest without adding ener-\ngy, a total specific enthalpy of about 23 MJ/kg and a\nnozzle reservoir pressure of approximately 90 MPa are\nrequired. This results in a nozzle reservoir temperature\nof about 10 000 K. Hence, ground-based test facilities\nare required in which high reservoir temperatures\nand pressures can be generated simultaneously. The\noperating range of some typical hypersonic facilities\nrelated to the reproduction of the flight velocity and\nthe binary scaling parameter is illustrated in Figure\n2.3.19. Due to the high thermal loads of wind tunnel\ncomponents, flows with the conditions described\nabove can only be achieved experimentally in impulse\nfacilities with short flow durations. This relationship\nis depicted in Figure 2.3.20. In shock tunnels, typical\ntest times in the order of milliseconds are achieved,\nresulting in specific requirements for the applied\nmeasurement techniques. The complexity of high\nenthalpy flows demands that experimental programs\nbe performed in close coordination with numerical\ninvestigations [2.3.21].\n\nAnother aspect of experimental aerothermodyna-\nmic investigations is the qualification of new materials\nfor thermal protection systems or the development\nand testing of novel cooling concepts under realistic\nflight conditions. This implies that the surface tem-\nperature of wind tunnel models must reach similarly\nhigh temperatures \u2014 in the order of 2000 K \u2014 as ob-\ntained in flight. For these investigations, arc-heated\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:97\n\n97\n10000\nShock tunnels\n< Arc-heated\nre tunnels\n2\n5\n= a\n\u00a7 5000 55\n= 23\noS =\n3 2\nyy\n0\n104 10\u00b0 10*\n\nMeasurement time [s]\n\nFigure 2.3.20: Achievable reservoir temperatures and available test\ntimes of different types of ground-based hypersonic test facilities.\n\nfacilities are particularly suitable because (as depicted\nin Figure 2.3.20) their test time is significantly longer\nthan that of shock tunnels and therefore the required\nsurface conditions can be adjusted.\n\nThe limits of the different facility-type operating\nranges given in Figures 2.3.18 to 2.3.20 are meant to\nillustrate basic differences. The operating ranges of\nindividual facilities belonging to one of the mentioned\ngroups can differ in detail from the boundaries shown.\nLikewise, the trajectory of a lift-generating reentry\nconfiguration from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) incor-\nporated in Figures 2.3.18 and 2.3.19, simply serves as\nan orientation. When considering a different type of\nreentry vehicle or reentry trajectory, it must be taken\ninto account that the relationship to the operating\nrange of the different types of facilities is changed.\n\nRegarding the numerical treatment of aerothermo-\ndynamic problems, different approaches are possible.\nWith increasing complexity these include empirical\nor semi-empirical correlations, surface inclination\nmethods (Newton method etc.) and ultimately com-\nplex and detailed computations of three-dimensional\nsteady and unsteady flow fields. An overview of the\ncomputational methods commonly used is given in\nTable 2.3.2.

While meteoroids\nare of natural origin, space debris has been created\nby the space activities of the last 50 years. The risk\nposed by space debris is growing continuously and\nfor manned missions in low Earth orbits (LEOs) it is\nalready higher than that resulting from meteoroids. As\na consequence, nowadays manned spacecraft have to\nbe protected against impacting objects. In the future\nthis will also be necessary for unmanned missions.\nFurthermore, future missions have to be planned\nso that they will not contribute to an uncontrolled\nincrease of space debris.\n\n2.4.1 The Environmental Conditions\n\n2.4.1.1 Meteoroids\n\nMeteoroids result from the disintegration or break-\nup of comets and asteroids, and they move in orbits\naround the Sun, passing the Earth. It can be assumed\nthat the total mass in the near-Earth environment (be-\nlow 2000 km altitude) is about 200 kg in total [2.4.1].A\ndistinction is made between continuous random me-\nteoroid flux (sporadic flux) and flux peaks (streams)\noccurring at regular intervals [2.4.2]. About 10% of\nthe total flux results from the streams. They appear\nin short time periods and their flux may exceed the\nsporadic flux by orders of magnitude. The Leonides\nare a well-known example of streams.\n\nThe density of the meteoroid particles varies from\n0.15 to 8 g/cm\u201d. The speed of collision relative to Earth\nis between 11 and 70km/s. The average velocity is\nabout 17km/s [2.4.1].\n\nBased on observations made from Earth and on\nmeasurements performed by satellites with dedicated\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nsensors as well as on the evaluation of surfaces from re-\ntrieved spacecraft brought back to Earth, models have\nbeen developed to describe the space environment.\nThese models are becoming more and more realistic\nand thus also more complex. The model developed by\nGriin et al. [2.4.3] is suitable for manual computations\nand first estimations and is used by NASA to describe\nthe meteoroid environment for the International\nSpace Station (ISS) [2.4.1]. The meteoroid module\nof the ESA environment model MASTER [2.4.4] is\nmore complex. It is based on the Devine model [2.4.5],\nwhich was extended by Staubach [2.4.6].\n\n2.4.1.2 Space Debris\n\nWhile the number of meteoroids remains nearly con-\nstant, the number of space debris particles continues\nto increase with ongoing space mission activities.\nMany objects remain in space and thus their number\nincreases continuously. Space debris includes objects\nlike upper stages, satellites and payloads, as well as\nparts released during the missions like bolts, springs or\nthe protective covers of optical instruments. The firing\nof solid rocket motors (SRMs) produces residues like\nslag and dust. Fragmentation as a result of explosions\nor collisions leads to an increased number of particles.\nThermal cycling and atomic oxygen corrosion acting\non painted surfaces and thermal protective foils lead\nto the release of chips of coating material. Impacts\nof small particles create ejection material, and so on.\nFigure 2.4.1 presents the different orbital debris par-\nticles in LEO and their typical sizes. Contrary to the\nabove-mentioned mechanism of space debris creation,\nthere are natural decay processes like atmospheric\ndrag and solar radiation pressure that slowly reduce\nthe number of particles. They change the orbit of\nthe objects until they reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n[2.4.7]. However, these mechanisms are not able to\ncompensate for the creation of particles, thus in total\nthe number of particles increases.\n\nMost of the data on space debris is collected by\nthe United States Space Command [2.4.8]. It obser-\nves objects larger than 10cm in LEO and larger than\n100cm in geostationary orbit (GEO). The result is\na catalog containing about 10000 objects (as at the\nmiddle of 2008 \u2014 see also Figure 2.4.2) [2.4.9]. Of\nthese objects about 3000 are spacecraft, 1600 are stages\n\n2/25/09 11:04:07 AM\n",

It can be noted\nthat the rate of object decay increases within the 11-\nyear solar cycle at times of increased solar activity.\nIn addition to the observed objects there are about\n110000 objects between 1 and 10cm in size, and the\nnumber of objects smaller than 1 cm is estimated to\nbe about 35 million [2.4.10]. Figure 2.4.3 shows the\nnumber of particles per cubic kilometer as a function\nof altitude for three different particle sizes (computed\nwith MASTER 2005 [2.4.4]). There are three regions\nof particle concentrations, representing the main\nused orbits: the LEO below 2000 km altitude, the 12h\norbits at about 18000 km and the GEO (24h orbit) at\nabout 36 000 km altitude.

It is between\n1.8 and 8.9g/cm\u2019, About 50 to 60% of the particles\nhave a density of about 2.8 g/cm? (aluminum alloys\nand glass) [2.4.1]. Their velocity with respect to the\nEarth is around 7-8 km/s in LEO, resulting in collision\nvelocities of up to about 16km/s.\n\nIn recent years models have been developed to\ndescribe the space debris environment. For planned\nmissions they allow computation of the risk of being\nhit by particles. Frequently used models are the ESA\nMASTER model and the ORDEM (Orbital Debris\nEnvironmental Model) of NASA [2.4.11]. These mo-\ndels are regularly updated and become more realistic\nwith time, but also more complex. Nowadays, special\ncomputer software (provided by space agencies) is\nneeded to compute the environmental data for a\ngiven mission. Again, the models are based on radar\nmeasurements made from Earth, on measurements\nmade on-board a spacecraft, as well as on the eval-\nuation of surfaces of retrieved spacecraft brought\nback to Earth.\n\n2.4.2 Future Development and Debris\nMitigation Measures\nAs mentioned in Section 2.4.1.2, the amount of space\n\ndebris increases and thus so does the risk for future\nmissions.

To avoid this, the space agencies are developing\nmitigation measures in international committees and\nproviding recommendations [2.4.13] for the planning\nof future missions.\n\nThese considerations are based on predictions\nfor the development of the space debris environment\nin the next 50 to 100 years. The first main contribu-\ntions were given by Rex [2.4.7], who conducted basic\nresearch in this field in the early 1980s. This early\nresearch was also the basis for the environment model\nMASTER mentioned above. Investigations performed\nfor and by ESA [2.4.10] predict an increase of objects\nlarger than 10cm by a factor of 2.5 within the next 100\nyears (Figure 2.4.4). This prediction is based on the\nassumption that space activities will continue in the\nfuture as at present (business as usual). For particles\nlarger than 1 cm, an increase by a factor of 5 is pre-\ndicted for the same time period (Figure 2.4.5). Here\nmainly collisions contribute to this increase.\n\nAccording to Rex [2.4.7], uncontrolled growth in\nthe amount of space debris will make safe operation\nin space impossible in the future. This prospect leads\nto considerations of how to avoid collisions. Special\nmissions to collect space debris particles in order to\nclean up the environment cannot be realized from a\ncost point of view. Two other measures are presently\nconsidered to have a reasonable chance of realization\n[2.4.10]:\n\ne Avoidance of explosions in orbits by passivation\nof inactive stages and satellites\ne Deorbiting objects at the end of their lifetime.\n\nUp to now, explosions have mainly contributed to the\ngeneration of space debris. To avoid these in future,\nthe remaining fuel should be released from inactive\nupper stages and satellites. This is called passivation\nand is already being done. However, if the passivated\nobjects remain in space, the possibility of collision is still\npresent. To improve this situation, stages and satellites\nshould be deorbited at the end of their mission by\ndistinct \u201cdelta-v\u201d maneuvers. This would be an effec-\ntive way to keep space clean for future space activities\n[2.4.7]. For orbits with increasing altitudes this method\nbecomes very expensive and cannot be easily realized.

Deorbiting can only be implemented for\nmissions in LEO.

These\nmodels must not only describe the present situation,\nbut also predict future developments. The first envi-\nronmental models were quite simple [2.4.2], [2.4.14],\nbut with increasing knowledge they became more\ncomplex. This is especially the case for space debris,\nas the continuous use of space results in a permanent\nchange in the environmental conditions.

It is dependent\non the particle size and is defined as the number of\nparticles per area and time. Accumulated flux means\nall particles larger than a certain size (e.g., with dia-\nmeter d).

This\ncomputation does not consider that different surface\nareas of the spacecraft are exposed to different particle\nfluxes. The flux to a part of the surface A, may be a\nmultiple k; (flux concentration factor) of the average\nflux. This gives the following number of impacts for\na spacecraft assembled from i surfaces:\n\nN=F,T Dy kj Ag (2.4.10)\ni\n\nThe flux concentration factor k; depends on the ori-\nentation of the surface As; on the flight direction and\non the directional distribution of the flux.

For this reason\nthe relatively simple model by Griin et al. [2.4.3] is\nintroduced in the context of this handbook.\n\nIt is assumed that the sporadic flux is omnidirec-\ntional relative to the Earth. Due to the gravitational\nfield of the Earth, the deep space flux (F,,) increases\ntowards the Earth. This is taken into account with a\nfocusing factor Gg:\n\nRe\n\nGo=1+ 2 (2.4.11)\n\nwith:\nRg = Earth radius + 100km (atmosphere),\n\nr= orbit radius.\n\nA spacecraft in an orbit around the Earth is parti-\nally shielded from impacts by meteoroids. This shield-\ning increases with decreasing altitude of the orbit and\nis described by the shielding factor s,:\n\n_ (1+ cosn)\n\nSf\n2 (2.4.12)\n\nR\nwith sinn =-28)\nr\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nThis results in the following flux depending on the\naltitude H of the orbit:\n\nFy = 55 G@ Fip (2.4.13)\n\nThe velocity of meteoroids relative to the Earth is\nbetween 11 and 72km/s with an average value of 17\nkm/s [2.4.1]. The model gives the flux as function of\nthe particle mass. With an assumed density of 1 g/cm*\nand spherical particles the interplanetary surface area\nflux F,,, is calculated as in Figure 2.4.8.\n\nAlthough it is assumed that the meteoroid flux\nis omnidirectional relative to the Earth, it becomes\ndirectional relative to a spacecraft moving through\nthe environment. This is shown in Figure 2.4.9. Here\nthe flux concentration factor k is presented over the\nsurface of a spherical spacecraft at 400km altitude\nin a circular orbit with fixed orientation relative to\nthe Earth. Due to the movement of the vehicle in the\nparticle field, a concentration is observed at those\nsurfaces facing the flight direction. The surfaces facing\nthe rear experience substantially smaller fluxes. Due\nto the Earth\u2019s shielding, the fluxes are also very small\non the lower surfaces.\n\n1.0E+04\n\n1.0E+02\n\n1.0E+00\n\n1.0E-02\n\n1.0E-04\n\n1.0E-06\n\n1.0E-08\n\nSurface area flux [1/(m?*yr)]\n\n1.0E-10\n\n1.0E-12\n\n1.0E-14\n\n1.0E.\n\n=16\n1.0E-05 1.0E-04 1.0E-03 1.0E-02 1.0E-01 1.0E+00\n\nDiameter [m\n\nFigure 2.4.8: Accumulated interplanetary surface area flux F.j, as\na function of particle diameter of meteoroids [2.4.3].\n\n2/25/09 11:04:10 AM\n",

It follows that in orbits with increa-\nsing inclination the average impact velocity increases\n(Figure 2.4.12). This amounts to approx. 10 to 12 km/s.\nThe maximum impact velocity is, assuming circular\norbits, twice the spacecraft velocity, which amounts\nto about 7.7 km/s at 400 km altitude.\n\nFor the orbit of the ISS with H = 400km and\ni=51.6\u00b0 the surface area flux as a function of particle\ndiameter as computed with ORDEM2000 for the year\n2010 is presented in Figure 2.4.13.

This was the\ncase in the collision of the satellite CERISE relatively\nshortly after its operational start with a cataloged\nfragment of an Ariane upper stage [2.4.15].\n\n2.4.4 Protection of Spacecraft Against\nImpacting Particles\n\nParticles which impact with speeds of 10km/s or\nhigher on metallic structures produce a crater with\na depth of about 3-5 times the particle diameter\n[2.4.16]. A thin metal wall will be perforated if the cra-\nter depth is about 60% of the wall thickness. A 1mm\nparticle is able to perforate a wall of 5mm thickness.\nTo withstand the mechanical loads, the structure of\na spacecraft has wall thicknesses of 1 to 2mm. From\nthis it becomes evident that protective measures are\nnecessary if a certain impact risk exists.\n\n2.4.4.1 Protection Concepts\n\nThe simplest protection concept is to increase the wall\nthickness of the outside structure of the spacecraft.\nHowever, that leads very quickly to an unacceptable\nincrease in structural mass. The introduction of a\nprotective shield in front of the structure is substan-\ntially more effective. This was suggested in 1947 by\nWhipple [2.4.17], which led to the Whipple shield or\nthe bumper shield. Its efficiency results from the fact\nthat an incoming particle is destroyed upon impact.\nThe fragments heat up and may melt or even vaporize\n[2.4.18], [2.4.19]. The cloud of fragments, droplets or\nvapor produced between the two walls expands and\nhits the second wall (protected structure) over an\nenlarged area (Figure 2.4.15). The impact energy is\ndistributed over a larger surface and is therefore less\ndamaging. In particular, protection concepts with one\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:107\n\n107\n\nI = +l\n\nFigure 2.4.15: Effect of a protection shield.\n\nor more shields have been developed for the man-\nned modules of the ISS in the last 15 years [2.4.20],\n[2.4.21], [2.4.22], [2.4.23]. These provide protection\nagainst particles with diameters up to 1 cm. In addi-\ntion to the outer shield these advanced concepts have\nan internal shield as well.\n\nThe concepts described above are particularly\nintended for the protection of manned spacecraft in\norder to ensure sufficient security for the crew. For\nunmanned spacecraft with mostly smaller surfaces\nand less stringent safety requirements, it is sufficient\nto plan for protection against particles of 2-3 mm\ndiameter. The additional costs for protection should\nbe as low as possible. A meaningful solution is to\ndesign the load-carrying structure as a sandwich\nstructure. This not only provides good structural\ncharacteristics and low mass, but also offers better\nprotection than monolithic structures. Compared to\na double wall the sandwich is, however, less efficient,\nsince the core reduces the expansion of the particle\ncloud between the face sheets. Another option is\nmultilayer insulation (MLI), which is introduced for\npassive temperature control in front of the structure\nand behaves like a very thin protective shield. In the\ncontext of a technology study performed on be-\nhalf of ESA/ESTEC [2.4.24], economical protection\nconcepts for satellites have been developed; these\nare reinforced MLI and sandwiches with enhanced\nprotective capability.\n\n2/25/09 11:04:20 AM\n",
    "129": "CHO2.indd Sec1:108\n\n108\n\n2.4.4.2 Design of Protection Concepts\n\nFor the design of protective measures both the mete-\noroid and space debris environments must be known,\nas well as the behavior of the protection concepts. This\nis described by damage or ballistic limits equations.\nWith the environment models, the geometry of the\nspacecraft, the damage equations and the mission\ndata, the protective measures can be evaluated in the\ncontext of damage prediction.\n\nDamage Equations\n\nDamage equations describe the behavior of protec-\ntion concepts, of structures or of components under\nimpact loads. They consider the size, the mass, the\nvelocity and the direction of the impacting particle as\nwell as the geometry and the material of the protection\nconcept. Because of the complex physical phenomena\narising during hypervelocity impacts, the damage\nequations are based primarily on test results. One\nproblem is that the velocities attainable in experiments\n(v < 9km/s) are smaller than those in reality. Extra-\npolations beyond the realizable velocities are made\neither with the help of simplified physical models or\nby means of numeric simulations. The data achieved\nby experiments is not sufficient by far to develop ge-\nneral damage equations for all protection concepts.\nA summary of existing damage equations is given in\nthe IADC Protection Manual [2.4.25]. Experimental\ntechniques and their limits are also documented there.\nIn this handbook damage equations for single-wall\nand double-wall structures are presented. Equations\nfor more complex configurations are often developed\non the basis of these equations. The damage equations\nare valid for spherical particles.\n\nSingle-Wall Structures\n\nThe behavior of single-wall structures during hyperve-\nlocity impacts depends on the strength and toughness\nof the impacted structure. One differentiates between\nductile and brittle materials. The metals used in space\nstructures are ductile, while glass and fiber-reinforced\nplastics show brittle behavior.\n\nMetals: If a particle hits a very thick metal wall,\nhigh pressures and high temperatures develop, frag-\nmenting and melting the wall as well as the particle\nmaterial. A crater develops with its volume being\na multiple of the particle volume (Figure 2.4.16).\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\ndp\nU R.\nt> 3p,, 2.2p_< t< 3p,, t<1.8p,,\n\nFigure 2.4.16: Impact on single-wall structures (thin-sheet\nimpact).\n\nMaterial is ejected opposite to the direction of im-\npact (ejecta). The high pressure travels as a shock\nwave through the material, is reflected at the rear\nside of the wall and returns as a tension wave. If the\nimpacted wall is thin, the tension wave exceeds the\ntensile strength of the material, leading to spallation.\nDetached spall may also threaten components behind\nthe wall.\n\nThe crater depth p,, (in cm) in very thick material\nis, according to Cour-Palais [2.4.26],\n\np, ot 2/3\nPoo = 5.24 HWA (2) (\u2018) di98 (2.4.14)\n\nPt\nwith:\n\nd = particle diameter [cm],\n\nH =Brinell hardness of the wall,\n\nP, = density of the particle [g/em\u2019],\n\nP, = density of the wall [g/cm\u2019],\n\nVv, = impact velocity normal to the surface [km/s],\nC= speed of sound of the wall material [km/s].\n\nThe exponent \u00a9 is 1/2 for p,/p, < 1.5 and 2/3 for\nP,/P,2 1.5.

A shield is arranged at a distance S\n(spacing) in front of the protected structure (backup\nwall). The effectiveness of this protection concept\ndepends on the impact velocity. The velocity range\n\nCHO2.indd Sec1:109\n\nFigure 2.4.18: Double-wall structure: the effect of impact\nvelocity.\n\nis divided into three regions with different behaviors\n(Figure 2.4.18). At low velocities the pressure develo-\nping when the shield is perforated is not sufficient to\ndestroy the particle. There is practically no protective\neffect. Starting from a critical speed, which depends\non the material combination of the shield and the\nparticle, the particle is destroyed. This process in-\ncreases with increasing velocity. The necessary rear\nwall thickness decreases at the same time. Above a\nsecond critical velocity the particle and its fragments\nare heated to such an extent that they begin to melt\nor evaporate. The cloud now represents a distribut-\ned load per unit area for the rear wall, its impulse\nincreasing with the impact velocity. According to\nChristiansen [2.4.20], the critical velocities for shields\nand particles made of aluminum alloy are y;,,; =\n3km/s and Vim = 7 km/s. The damage equations are\ngiven for the velocity from 0 to vj; and for velocities\nexceeding \u00a5j;,,2. In the velocity range between the\ntwo critical values a linear interpolation is used (see\nFigure 2.4.19).\n\nFor double-wall structures made of aluminum\nalloys the damage equations proposed by Christiansen\n[2.4.20] and quoted below are regarded as standard.\nThe critical particle diameter d, (in cm) which can\nbe defeated by the given shielding without detaching\nspall at the rear wall is computed.\n\nFor v, < 3km/s:\n\n2/25/09 11:04:22 AM\n",

Which particle shapes are to be expected has\nto be described by the environment models.\n\nA further uncertainty in the damage equations\nused is the behavior at impact velocities above today\u2019s\nexisting test options (v > 8km/s). Although higher\nvelocities can be simulated numerically [2.4.33], the\nresult of these computations depends on the correct\ndescription of the material behavior. This can only be\ndetermined reliably by experiments, which are again\nlimited to velocities up to 8km/s.\n\nDamage Prediction\n\nA spacecraft in the meteoroid/space debris environ-\n\nment is to be designed such that during the mission\n\nlifetime a required probability of survival is reached.\n\nThis is the probability of no impact leading to failure.\n\nThe calculation of the protection concept is done in\n\ntwo steps:\n\ne Preliminary design\n\ne Numerical computation using dedicated software\nfor damage prediction.\n\nn both cases environment models and damage equa-\ntions are needed.\n\nPreliminary Design\nn a first step the particle flux is computed, leading\nto the required probability of no failure (e.g., no\npenetration, see Equation 2.4.9). The mission dura-\ntion and the surface area of the spacecraft have to be\nnown. With the flux known the particle diameter\neading to this flux can be derived from the environ-\nment models (Figure 2.4.13). This is the particle size\nor which the protection concept has to be designed.\nf the structure is known its damage equations are\nused to compute whether the particle leads to a fai-\nlure or not considering the average impact velocity.\nn case of a failure the structure has to be modified\naccordingly. If the attitude of the spacecraft is fixed\nwith respect to Earth, then the flux varies over the\nsurface (Figures 2.4.9 and 2.4.14). It may be suffi-\ncient to protect only those surfaces with high flux\nconcentration factors k.\n\nThe protection concept will be efficient when\nthe number of impacts divided by the surface area is\nequally distributed over the spacecraft. For a patch i\n\nCHO2.indd Sect:111\n\nlll\n\non the surface, the following flux is computed, if the\nflux concentration factor k, is known:\n\nFe= Po (2.4.22)\ni GAT\n\nThus the particle diameter d; can be determined\nagainst which the protection concept of the patch i\nis to be designed.\n\nNumerical Damage Prediction\n\nThe presented preliminary design does not consider\nthe velocity distribution and the impact angle of the\nparticles. Moreover, the orientation of the surface pat-\nches is not considered exactly. In the case of complex\ngeometries, parts of the surface area may be shaded\nagainst impact. These influences are considered by\ncomputer programs for damage prediction. Here\nthe geometry of the spacecraft and its attitude in\nspace are described by surface elements. Damage\nequations are assigned to surfaces depending on their\nwall design. From the environment models it can be\ndetermined which particles from which directions\nand with which velocities hit the spacecraft or the\nindividual surfaces. The result of the computation is\nthe number of impacts leading to a failure for the in-\ndividual surfaces and the probability of survival of the\nspacecraft (Figure 2.4.21).

In connection with mathematical optimization\nand suitable damage equations [2.4.30], the protec-\ntion concept can be optimized in such a way that the\nrequired probability of survival is obtained with a\nminimum of additional mass.\n\n2.4.5 Mission Planning\n\nWith respect to meteoroids and space debris, two\nsubstantial aspects are to be considered when planning\na mission. These are on the one hand avoiding the\ngeneration of new space debris and on the other hand\nreducing the risk resulting from impacts.\n\nAvoiding Space Debris: In order to avoid increa-\nsing the amount of space debris, the following aspects\nare to be considered during mission planning. It has to\nbe guaranteed that the new spacecraft does not remain\nin orbit for longer than 25 years. Depending on the\norbital altitude, this is achieved either by deorbiting\nthe spacecraft or by reorbiting it into a graveyard or-\nbit. The chosen launcher should fulfill the standards\nof avoidance. This means passivation of upper stages\nand their deorbiting back to Earth. Solid propellant\nmotors should be designed to release no or only little\ndust and slag. Mission-related objects have to be pre-\nvented from becoming debris. This means that cover\ncaps and pyrotechnic devices should be attached to\nthe spacecraft so that they are not released into space\nafter use. Ductile materials are to be used for surface\ncoatings in order to minimize blistering and the ge-\nneration of paint flakes.\n\nReducing the Risk: In order to minimize the risk\nof particle impacts, the spacecraft is to be built as\nsmall and compact as possible. If the planned mis-\nsion permits, the height and the inclination of the\norbit should be selected so that the particle fluxes to\nbe expected are as small as possible. Short-duration\nmissions (e.g., Space Shuttle missions) should be\nplanned for times when no meteoroid streams are\nexpected. If the vehicle\u2019s orientation is fixed with\nrespect to the Earth\u2019s surface an attitude is favorable\nwhere surfaces exposed to high fluxes are as small as\npossible. Safety can be increased substantially by the\nuse of multiwall instead of single-wall structures.\n\n2 Fundamentals\n\nA sandwich structure is preferred to a single-wall\nstructure. With its face sheets it practically represents\na two-wall structure. Sensitive and critical compo-\nnents like payloads, receivers, batteries and pipes\nshould be placed on the inside far away from critical\nsurfaces (with high fluxes). If the architecture of the\nspacecraft does not permit this, these components\nmay need to be additionally protected.\n\nBibliography\n\n2.4.1 Anonymous.

    "136": "3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nHorst Holsten\n\nScientific research and commercial space utilization\nrequire transportation systems which carry spacecraft\nand their payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. The\nphysical basis of all launch vehicles used today is the\nrepulsion principle, according to which any change of\nmotion is produced by corresponding opposed forces.\nThis forward impulse, also called thrust, is developed\nby rocket engines.\n\nBy following this principle, the construction of\na launch vehicle can be regarded as simple, but seen\nfrom the standpoint of technical implementation\nit is quite complex. Its essential components are\npropellant tanks, engines, structures, navigation and\nguidance equipment, separation systems, attitude\ncontrol systems and flight data monitoring systems.\nThe two propellants, the fuel and the oxidizer, are\nignited in the thrust chamber where they produce\nvery high-temperature gases by chemical reactions\nand then expand through a nozzle, thereby generating\nthrust.\n\nFor propulsion, solid or liquid propellants are\nused, in special cases also in combination. In the case\nof solid propellants, the combustion components\nare mixed and cast in a cylindrical mold. Once ignited,\nthe whole block burns continuously; interruption of\nthe combustion process is not possible. In the case\nof liquid propellants, the fuel and oxidizer are fed\nseparately into the combustion chamber, where they\nundergo chemical reaction. The flow can be con-\ntrolled or even interrupted with the possibility of\nreignition.\n\nSpace transportation systems were developed in\nthe second half of the twentieth century to explore\nextraterrestrial space, the Moon and the planets of\nthe Solar System. Soon Earth-related applications for\nsatellites also started, including weather forecasting,\ncommunications, Earth observation and human space\nflight, culminating in 1969 with the first landing on\nthe Moon.\n\nLaunch vehicles have been developed from a\nnumber of different motivations. First, there are\nthe national strategic and sovereign aspects, such as\nachieving autonomous access to space. But market\nforecasts as well as the technological standards of\nindustry and research projects are also decisive for\nthe conception of space transportation systems. The\nlaunch vehicles currently used meet the demand for\nworldwide spacecraft transport. They have different\npayload capacities regarding mass and volume and are\noffered at different launch costs. On average, in the\npresent decade 20 satellites in the class of 3-5 tonnes\nare launched annually. To this sum approximately\nthe same number of small satellites in the class up to\n1 tonne can be added. The transport costs are in the\norder of 15 000 euros (20000 US dollars) per kilogram\nof payload; the reliability of reaching the predicted\norbit is higher than 95%.\n\nFor future space programs such as lunar and\nMars exploration, the transportation system is no\nlonger regarded as the critical technological element,\npresuming that these programs can be executed with\nwell-tested and qualified launch vehicles.

For each launch, a new vehicle\nis necessary. This results in two challenges for future\nspace transportation systems: first, reusability and,\nsecond, human space transport qualification, with\npossibly a combination of both requirements. Basic\nresearch in transportation systems has been going on\nfor many years, particularly in the fields of take-off\nand landing capability, reentry, mass reduction and\nreusability. Technological breakthroughs can, however,\nonly be expected in the case of drastically increased\ndemand for space applications.\n\nThe sections of this chapter will give a detailed\nintroduction to the theory, technology and design\nof present and future space transportation systems,\nlaunch vehicle stages and subsystems. The propulsion\nrequirements for various space missions, different\npropulsion systems, as well as the development and\nqualification philosophies for components and com-\nplete transportation systems, will be described. Finally,\nrequirements and implementation of launch sites and\nground facilities will also be treated.\n\n3.1 Systems\n\nJens Lassmann and Michael H. Obersteiner\n\nThe requirements for launch systems (rockets) deviate\nnoticeably from those for other land, water or air\nvehicles. A substantial difference is that today\u2019s sys-\ntems are not reusable, or reusable only to a very low\nextent. Even for the partially reusable Space Shuttle\nsystem, only the orbiter is refurbished for reuse, and it\namounts to only 3% of the take-off mass. The reason is\nthat, compared to other transport systems, the perfor-\nmance requirements for the chosen launch system are\nextremely high and the partially expendable solution\nis the only feasible one based on today\u2019s technology\nand experience.\n\nThese extreme requirements will become clear\nafter the basic principles are presented in Section 3.1.2,\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nfollowing the introduction. The \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of a\nrocket are presented thereafter to give an impression\nof the complexity of the overall system and details of\nthe resulting requirements. Because of the extreme\nrequirements and the complexity of the system, the\ndevelopment of launch systems is an extensive process,\nin terms of both time and expense. A description of\nthe logistics involved will complete the description,\nsupported by an overview of today\u2019s launch systems.\nAt the end future prospects for reusable systems will\nbe given.\n\n3.1.1 Introduction\n\nLaunch systems transport all types of spacecraft,\nwhich are simply named payload among the rocket\ncommunity, to destinations in space targets. These\ndestinations can be trajectories or selected places\non the surface of planets or other cosmic bodies. In\naccord with cosmic velocities, launch systems must\nobtain high speeds and the accelerated payloads are\ntherefore comparatively small. For launch into a low\nEarth orbit the payload must be accelerated to almost\n8km/s and in this case it amounts to typically 1-5%\nof the take-off mass of the launch system.\n\nPayloads of a rocket can be of very different types,\ndepending on the particular mission, which may\ninvolve:\n\ne Scientific probes and satellites\ne Application satellites for\n\n\u2014 Telecommunications\n\n\u2014 Earth observation and meteorology\n\n\u2014 Navigation\ne Systems for human space missions.\n\nSince the first satellite launch \u2014 Sputnik 1 launched\nby the USSR on October 4, 1957 \u2014 the number of\nmissions per year accomplished worldwide by space\nlaunchers has changed noticeably. In the beginning,\nmilitary Earth observation as well as national prestige\nprojects were of great importance and within 10 years\nthe number of launches steadily increased to about\n140 per year (including launch failures). Afterwards\nthis trend reversed, mainly because of the introduc-\ntion of digital image recording and transmission.\nThis continuous reduction led to today\u2019s number of\n\n2/24/09 3:16:46 PM\n",
    "138": "3.1 Systems\n\nabout 60 launches per year. If one examines the dif-\nferent space mission activities and current launcher\ndevelopments, the trend is predicted to change again\nto an increasing number of launches.\n\nToday the launch of telecommunication satel-\nlites into geostationary orbit and/or into transfer\norbits plays the most important role, using 30-40%\nof the available annual launch capacity. Most of these\nsatellites are commercially operated and the costs con-\nnected with the launch and the associated risk are an\nimportant element in the economic business plan.\n\nHuman missions are conducted by the USA\n(Space Shuttle), Russia and China. With under 10\nmissions per year they are less significant regarding\nsheer number, but are of great importance for national\nbudgets and industrial development because of the\nhigh expenditures for preparation and execution.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish\nbetween military and civilian missions. On one side\nthe military exploit commercial satellites, at least for\ntelecommunications, while on the other side purely\nmilitary tasks are combined with tasks such as civil se-\ncurity and disaster management. So far active weapon\nsystems have not been placed in Earth orbits, or at least\nonly to a very low extent. Because it is comparatively\nsimple to detect and destroy satellites, it is expected\nthat this will not fundamentally change.\n\nDetermined by the payloads, launch systems\naccomplish different missions. Launch into a low\nEarth orbit (LEO) is the first step. With a combi-\nnation of propelled and ballistic (coasting) flight\nphases the higher orbits necessary for reaching the\nMoon or interplanetary targets can subsequently be\nachieved. Interstellar missions (with reasonable mis-\nsion durations) are beyond the capabilities of today\u2019s\naunch systems. For this, new propulsion technologies\nwould be necessary. Space probes launched in the\n970s (Pioneer and Voyager) \u2014 using rocket-powered\naunch systems and gravitational maneuvers at\nplanets \u2014 progressed furthest into outer space. Voyager\nhas reached a distance of 100 astronomical units\n(i.e., 100 times the distance between the Sun and the\nEarth) or about 14 light-hours after approximately\n30 years of flight time. Proxima Centauri, the closest\nneighbor of our Sun at about 4 light-years, is thus\nstill very far away.\n\nCHO3.indd 117\n\n117\n\nCloser to home, flight toward our own Sun has\nits limits too. Realistically, even with a combination\nof a manageable number of stages and a reasonable\npayload it is not possible to reach the Sun directly. The\nEarth\u2019s speed on its track around the Sun of 29.8 km/s\nis extremely high and at present an insurmountable\nobstacle.\n\nLaunch systems are complex machines, consisting\ntypically of several stages which often use varying\npropulsion systems. The development and required\ntests are accordingly complex. Extensive development\nbudgets and long development times are necessary.\nIn Europe a multitude of countries and compa-\nnies work on the development and production of\nthe Ariane and Vega rockets. Political will is almost\nalways the starting point for the decision to develop\na launch system. Development and testing of launch\nsystems are accomplished worldwide with govern-\nment funding. The US company SpaceX is one of the\nfew exceptions. SpaceX is about to make the Falcon\nbooster rocket operational with essentially only pri-\nvate investment. However, support in the form of\ngovernment-funded technologies and infrastructure\nwas also necessary.\n\nThe political will for government funding is also\nmotivated by the policy to support the national space\nindustry with technologically interesting and challen-\nging tasks. Therefore, as part of European cooperation\nthe so-called georeturn rule applies, ensuring the re-\nturn of an ESA member state\u2019s financial contributions\nback to that member state\u2019s national industry.\n\nThe industrial constellations have likewise chan-\nged since the first space launches and the trend to\nintroduce more commercialization and rationali-\nzation is unmistakable. A limited number of system\ncompanies cooperate with multiple suppliers. The\nmost important component or the most important\nsubsystem of booster rockets and/or their stages is\nthe propulsion system. The manufacturers of civil\nsolid propellant engines are typically also manu-\nfacturers of military rocket propulsion systems. The\nmanufacturers of liquid propellant rocket systems\nare mostly united with aviation engine manufactu-\nrers. About 7000 people altogether are employed in\ndeveloping and operating launch systems in Europe.\nA small number of them, about 200 engineers, work\nat Arianespace, the European commercial operator\n\n2/24/09 3:16:46 PM\n",

In addition, Arianespace, in coope-\nration with a Russian manufacturing firm, will\nlaunch Soyuz rockets from the European launch site\nof Kourou in South America, presumably starting\nfrom 2009.\n\nArianespace was the first launch operator (also\ncalled launch service provider) to concentrate on\nthe launch of commercial satellites. Success helped\nEurope to keep the institutional spending necessary\nfor the infrastructure \u2014 often also called fixed costs \u2014\nattractively low. The infrastructure for launcher pro-\nduction and operation comprises the launch pad,\ntrajectory tracking, weather forecasting and data\ncommunication. In addition, special industrial in-\nfrastructure for manufacturing, integration and tes-\nting must be included.\n\nAs a result of the historical evolutionary process,\nfixed and development costs are financed by govern-\nment budgets. Driven by competing launcher systems\nand low prices (in particular Russian manufacturers\noffer extremely low prices) the world market prices\nfor commercial space launcher systems dropped\nso far that Arianespace could no longer recover\na substantial portion of the fixed costs. But after\nUS manufacturers withdrew from the commercial\nmarket and the Russian launchers increasingly faced\nproblems of quality and costing, price development\nhas tended again toward cost coverage, including\nthe fixed costs.\n\n3.1.2 Fundamentals\n\nTo understand launch systems, as a first step one\nhas to understand the basic aspects of the task and\ndesign of a launcher. In principle the task is to launch\na payload into its designated orbit, and computation\nof the performance of the launcher is the basis of the\ndesign. Ascent against Earth\u2019s gravitational force to\nreach an Earth orbit is the primary task of a space\nlaunch system. For today\u2019s usually rocket-powered\nlaunch vehicles, the fundamental rocket equation in\ncombination with the principle of staging provides\na necessary, but not sufficient, basis for assessing\nperformance.\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\n3.1.2.1 Payloads and Missions\n\nKnowing the payload mass and the target orbit a simple\nmission analysis can be accomplished. The core of this\nsimple mission analysis is to determine the launch\nsystem\u2019s capability of producing the required velocity\nchange Av necessary to execute the mission.\n\nThis velocity increment is determined to a large\nextent by the velocity of the target orbit. Other con-\nsiderations are:\n\ne The initial speed due to the Earth\u2019s rotation\ne The gravitational losses\n\ne The losses from air drag\n\ne Steering losses.\n\nAdditional details will be given in the following\nsections.\n\nThe velocity gain provided by the launch system\nmust at least correspond to the velocity requirement\nof the mission. Computation of the ideal velocity gain\nof the launch system using the fundamental rocket\nequation needs as input:\n\ne Payload mass\n\ne Number of stages\n\ne Propulsion performance (for each stage)\n\ne Structural mass and fuel residuals (for each stage).\n\nThe derivation of the theoretical basis and the asso-\nciated formulas are likewise given in the following\nsections.\n\nA further important component of the mission\nanalysis is the introduction of margins. A simple, but\nsuccess-promising logic is: the simpler the estimation,\nthe more margins must be introduced. Justified by\nthe uncertainties of the estimations, margins can be\ndefined for:\n\ne Payload mass\n\ne Velocity requirement of the mission\n\ne Propulsion performance (for each stage)\ne Structural mass (for each stage).\n\nThe margins can be reduced by improving the cal-\nculation of performance with the help of a detailed\nsimulation of the launch system.

Examples\nof such experience are included in the following\nsections.\n\n3.1.2.2 Momentum and the Fundamental Rocket\nEquation\n\nRockets use propellant, which they carry along, to\nproduce thrust and velocity. With this principle they\nare to a large extent independent of their environment\nand therefore suitable for traveling into outer space.\nOn the basis of the principle of the conservation of\nlinear momentum, the discharging of an incremental\nparticle with mass dm and speed c causes an opposite\nmomentum on the rocket, that is a speed change dv\nof the rocket mass m:\n\nm:-dv=c:-dm (3.1.1)\n\nIf the exhaust velocity c is constant and if no further\nforces affect the rocket mass, then the variables can be\nseparated and integrated for the fundamental rocket\nequation, which was conceived in 1903 by the Russian\nscientist K. Tsiolkovsky (or Ziolkowski):\n\nm\nv=c-In\u20142\n\n[m/s] (3.1.2)\n\nMe\n\nwhere:\n\nv= ideal velocity gain,\nMp = initial mass of the rocket,\nm, = mass at burnout.\n\nThe demand for a constant exhaust velocity is ful-\nfilled to a good approximation by chemical rocket\npropulsion, which is used in today\u2019s launch systems.\n\nFrom the principle of the conservation of linear\nmomentum the thrust F of the rocket also can be\nderived as the product of the mass flow mand the\nexhaust velocity c:\n\nF=m-c [N] (3.1.3)\n\nFrom the thrust and the rocket mass the acceleration\nacan be computed:\na=F/m [mls*] (3.1.4)\n\nAll considerations of forces and acceleration must\ntake into account that thrust, air drag, lift and similar\n\nCHO3.indd 119\n\n119\n\nkinds of forces are contact forces. The force of gravity\nis by contrast an interior force, and its effect on the\nreaction forces within a rocket and on its movement\nmust therefore be regarded differently.\n\n3.1.2.3 Staging\n\nA single rocket stage can hardly reach orbital speed\nunless the payload is very small. This limitation can\nbe overcome by staging. The ideal velocity gain of the\nindividual stages then adds up to the total velocity\ngain VG:\nVG=Vy + V2 +13... (3.1.5)\nComputation of the total velocity gain based on the\nfundamental rocket equation requires consideration\nof the masses of the upper stages in the initial and\nburnout masses of the lower stages. The velocity gain\nof the individual stages is thereby reduced. However,\nin total a larger velocity gain and/or larger payload\nperformance is achieved. But this increase is limited.\nThe maximum performance of a staged rocket laun-\ncher results to a first approximation in the following\nnumber of stages:\nNop, = 1.12 + v/e (3.1.6)\nwhere Cis the average value of the exhaust velocities\nof all stages. As the equation delivers typically a deci-\nmal number it must be rounded to the next integer.\n\nWith the above equations the efficiency of launch\nvehicles can be computed as a first approximation.\nHowever, reference values for the employed parameters\nare necessary.\n\nTo estimate the exhaust velocity three characteristic\npropellant groups can be distinguished:\ne Solid propellant engines, c ~ 2500 m/s\ne Medium-energy liquid propulsion, c ~ 3000 m/s\ne High-energy liquid propulsion, c ~ 4000 m/s.\n\nFrom this the specific impulse results from the\nequation\nIsp = ego [s] (3.1.7)\n\nas a common performance figure for propulsion.\n\n2/24/09 3:16:47 PM\n",
    "141": "CHO3.indd 120\n\n120\n\nFor the computation of the mass ratios it is neces-\nsary to estimate the structural mass. It varies typically\nbetween 5 and 15% of the total mass depending on\nthe size of the rocket stage and the propulsion and/or\npropellants used.\n\nIt is meaningful to use solid propellant engines for\nthe first flight phase and high-energy liquid propul-\nsion for the upper stages. The solid propellant stages\nare well suited to produce the take-off thrust. The\nhigh-energy and accordingly more efficient upper\nstages are less heavy and thus reduce the propulsion\ntask of the lower stages. Therefore the investment in\nhigh-energy propellant upper stages also results in a\nreduction of the mass of the lower stages.\n\n3.1.2.4 Ascent Trajectory and Performance\nRequirements\n\nThe ascent of a launch vehicle begins vertically. This\nis due to the technical feasibility and the dynamic\nbehavior during the launch phase. For a successful\ntake-off it is necessary for the thrust to be at least equal\nto the launch vehicle mass. A 10-20% higher take-off\nthrust helps the launcher, which is flight dynamically\nunstable, to maintain both the correct flight attitude\nby swiveling the rocket engines and the acceleration\nto build up the required speed. However, further\nincreasing the take-off thrust is of no advantage. On\nthe one hand additional investments in propulsion\nwould become necessary, and on the other hand the\nacceleration at burnout would become even higher,\nputting additional strain on the system, because when\nthe major part of the propellant is used up, the lighter\nweight of the rocket experiences high acceleration.\n\nTo reach a horizontal orbit it is necessary to tilt\nthe rocket shortly after take-off by roughly 10\u00b0. After\nthe tilt maneuver the thrust direction can be optimally\noriented so that it is tangential to the flight direction.\nGravitational force then turns the trajectory toward\na horizontal orientation. The initial tilt must be mat-\nched with the acceleration level and the target orbit in\nsuch a way that at burnout the desired orbital speed\nand flight attitude are reached.\n\nThe velocity requirement for space launch sys-\ntems results mainly from the difference between the\ninitial and terminal speeds. For the initial speed the\nEarth\u2019s rotation must be taken into account; it of\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\ncourse depends on the geographical latitude of the\nlaunch site and the direction of the trajectory. The\nterminal velocity is the target orbital speed.\n\nThe ascent from the surface to an orbit is an ascent\ninside Earth\u2019s gravitational field. Thus so-called\ngravitational losses will occur. This corresponds not\nonly to the gravitational energy invested in the payload,\nbutalso tothe gravitational energy invested in the sections\nof the launch vehicle to be transported upward, and\nin particular in the build-up of the \u201cfuel and/or ex-\nhaust tower.\u201d Coasting flight phases in the out-of-\natmosphere part of the ascent of launch vehicles can\nhelp to reduce gravitational losses. Air drag and steer-\ning losses lead to additional velocity requirements.\nAt the end, margins for unexpected orbit/trajectory\ndisturbances and inaccuracies must be included.\n\nThe velocity requirement for reaching a low Earth\norbit (~200km altitude) adds up as follows:\n\ne Orbital velocity: 7.9 km/s\n\ne Earth rotation speed gains at launch: 0-465 m/s\ne Gravitational losses: 1-1.5 km/s\n\ne Air drag losses: 100-150 m/s\n\ne Steering losses: 20-50 m/s\n\ne Performance margin: 1-2%\n\ne Total: 8.6-9.8 km/s.\n\nMissions to a Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), geosta-\ntionary orbit (GEO) and/or its transfer orbit (GTO),\nlunar missions or escape missions from Earth\u2019s gravi-\ntational field result in accordingly higher velocity requi-\nrements. Values for the launch from the European\nlaunch site at Kourou in South America are given in\nTable 3.1.1.\n\nTable 3.1.1: Velocity requirements for various target orbits with\nlaunch from Kourou.\n\nVelocity\nTarget orbit Inclination requirement\n[km/s]\nLEO 200km 5\u00b0 9\nSSO 700km 98\u00b0 9.7\nGTO 200/36 000 km 0\u00b0 (equatorial) 11.6\nMoon (impact) 12.0\nEscape 12.5\nLunar orbit =13\nMars orbit =15\n\n2/24/09 3:16:48 PM\n",
    "142": "3.1 Systems\n\n3.1.3 Building Blocks\n\nA launch system consists of a launch vehicle and a\nground segment and is composed of a set of building\nblocks whose main task is to transfer payloads into\nspace.\n\nThe launch vehicle itself consists of the following\nbuilding blocks:\ne Boost stages\ne Propulsive stages including engines\ne Equipment bay\ne Payload adaptors\ne Multiple payload launch system\ne Payload fairings.\n\nBoost stages with their high-thrust engines pro-\nvide additional accelerating power during the first\nflight phase for reducing large gravitational losses.\nMainly solid propulsion and medium-energy liquid\npropellant rocket engines are used.\n\nIn general two, three or four stages form the\npropulsive system of a launch vehicle. Each of these\npropulsive stages consists of propellant tanks, propel-\nlant pumps, rocket engines, attitude control system\nand an interstage including the stage separation sys-\ntem. Propellants and propulsive system concepts may\ndiffer for each stage. A performance-optimized launch\nvehicle is made of high-thrust lower stages and an\nupper stage with a high specific impulse engine.\n\nRocket stages can be bundled in parallel, as is\nusually the case for boost stages and the first stage,\nor they are operated in series, that is they are ignited\nsequentially.\n\nGuidance, navigation and control of a launch\nvehicle are fully autonomous during the flight. This is\nachieved via individual avionics systems within each\nstage (e.g., Soyuz) or centrally by the upper stage for\nthe whole launcher (e.g., Ariane 5).\n\nThe payload is housed in the so-called payload\ncompartment, consisting of the payload adaptors,\nthe multiple payload launch system and the payload\nfairings. Payload adaptors are the structural interface\nbetween the launch vehicle and the payload, which\nusually has a smaller diameter than the rocket itself.\nLarge launch vehicles like Ariane 5 are capable of\nlaunching multiple payloads independent of each\nother during the same flight. To do this they use\n\nCHO3.indd 121\n\n121\n\nspecific multiple payload launch systems or payload\ndispensers. This technique leads to attractive launch\nprices per payload.\n\nThe launch vehicle alone is not capable of laun-\nching a payload. Without the ground segment and its\nspecific infrastructure a launch vehicle cannot be ope-\nrated. This ground infrastructure consists mainly of:\ne Launch vehicle integration buildings\ne Payload preparation buildings\ne Launch platform\ne Launch zone including launch tower, lightning\nmasts, exhaust ducts, propellant, gases and water\nrovision\ne Control facilities for launcher and payloads\ne Telemetry and tracking stations along the flight\nath of the launcher\ne Radar systems\ne Facilities for weather forecasting\ne Production facilities for cryogenic propellants.\n\nIn addition, the launch site must provide adequate\ninfrastructure for delivering and storing the launcher\nstages, payloads, propellants and gases. Operational\npersonnel and customer representatives must be\naccommodated nearby. This means that not only\nhotels, restaurants and grocery stores have to be\navailable, but also schools and other social facilities.\n\n3.1.4 Project Phases\n\nA typical launch system project can be split into several\nphases of its life cycle. In order to start a launcher\ndevelopment project all the enabling technologies\nhave to be mature enough. The maturity of analytical\nmethods, materials and manufacturing processes can\nbe described by the technology readiness level (TRL)\nand should be at least at level 4 to 6 when starting a\ndevelopment. The development of technologies can be\na lengthy process before they are ready to be applied.\nAs an example, it took about 10 years to develop an\naluminum alloy that can be welded for manufacturing\nthe cryogenic oxygen tank for Ariane.\n\nThe concept phase as the first step of launch\nvehicle development starts independently of the matu-\nrity of the technologies and is mainly for finding ideas\nand preparing the development program. Based on\n\n2/24/09 3:16:49 PM\n",
    "143": "CHO3.indd 122\n\n122\n\nvarious concepts a program proposal is established\nwhich leads to an invitation to tender issued by space\nagencies in the case of public funding. The duration\nof the concept phase is linked to the decision cycles\nof the public customers and typically lasts for four\nto ten years.\n\nWork on concrete launcher configurations starts\nduring the preliminary design phase. Starting with\nhigh-level functional requirements, the launch system\nis defined and different technical solutions are sub-\njected to trade-off investigations. This phase takes\ntypically 20% of the development time and is con-\ncluded by the preliminary design review (PDR). The\ndefinition of the launcher and its subsystems and the\nanalytical justification for their functioning are part\nof the design phase. Development tests for calibrating\nmathematical models may accompany these activities.\nThis second concrete development step takes about\n30% of the development time and is concluded by the\ncritical design review (CDR).\n\nThe following step qualifies the launch system\non the ground. Tests are performed to verify the\nmechanical integrity as well as to demonstrate the\nfunctioning of the engines and the hydraulic and\nelectrical systems. These tests are carried out on\ncomponent, subsystem and system levels. Based on\nthese tests all mathematical models are validated in\norder to allow precise prediction of the launcher\u2019s\nbehavior on the ground and in flight. This phase\ntakes about 40% of the development time and is\ncompleted by the qualification commission. As evi-\ndence of their agreement on the flightworthiness of\nthe launcher, all involved parties (customer, certifying\nagency and development authority/contractor) sign\nthe qualification certificate.\n\nIn parallel to the qualification, the manufacturing\nprocess for the first flight system hardware begins.\nFollowing the first launch an intensive evaluation of\nthe data measured in flight is made. The comparison\nof predicted values to the measured data leads to a\nfinal correlation with the mathematical models. This\nenables an analysis of potential deviations during the\nproduction phase. Thus it is possible to fully justify\ndecisions to use or to delete hardware items. Typically\nsmall changes to the launcher are introduced after this\nphase in order to correct behavior deviations and to\nachieve a sufficient robustness of the design for the\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nseries production. Including the first flight, this last\nphase takes about 10% of the development time. In\ntotal, a latinch system development requires about 10\nyears, starting with the preliminary design and ending\nwith series production.\n\nDuring the operations phase the configuration of\nthe launcher should be kept frozen. Only a minimum\nnumber of changes should be made in order not\nto deviate from the qualified status. Besides this\nconsideration, the stability of the manufacturing pro-\ncesses contributes to a large extent to the reliability of a\nlaunch system. An accompanying test program is often\nperformed in parallel to the series production in order\nto verify that the qualification of critical components\nlike engines is being maintained.\n\nAt the end of the operations phase the production\nof the launcher and its components is terminated.\nConsequently a sufficient number of spare parts have\nto be available also for the last launcher in order not to\nendanger the mission in case of integration problems.\nThis run-down phase is further penalized by a decre-\nase in awareness on the part of the manufacturing\npersonnel since those who are well experienced will\nalready have moved on to new projects. In order to\nmitigate the risk of mission loss, the quality assurance\neffort should be significantly increased during this last\nphase of the launch system life cycle (Figure 3.1.1).\n\n3.1.5 Overview of Launch Systems\n\nLaunch systems are the key to space and therefore of\nhigh strategic interest. Today the following nations\noperate launch systems for civil use: Russia and\nUkraine (since 1957), USA (since 1958), Europe (since\n1965), Japan (since 1970), China (since 1970), India\n(since 1980) and Israel (since 1990). Other launch\nsystem development activities are ongoing in Brazil,\nKorea and Iran.\n\nThere are various ways to categorize launch\nsystems. According to the number of stages, one\ndistinguishes single stage to orbit (SSTO) from\nmultiple stage launchers (mostly two stages to LEO\nor three stages to GTO). Launchers can be catego-\nrized as expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) or as\nfully or partly reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). All\nof these launcher types can be launched vertically\n\n2/24/09 3:16:49 PM\n",

Those then need a high reliability\nwhich must be implemented in the vehicle design and\na return module. Another often-used categorization\nis to distinguish launchers for commercial use from\n\u201cinstitutional\u201d launchers.\n\n3.1.5.1 Present Launch Systems\n\nThe majority of spacecraft launched today are satellites\nand automated scientific space probes. In the following,\nlaunch systems are therefore categorized according\nto how much payload mass is placed into the GEO\ntransfer (GTO) orbit: small launchers up to 3000kg,\nmedium-sized launchers between 3000 and 6000kg,\nand heavy-lift launchers with more than 6000kg.\nSmall launchers are mainly used for transferring\npayloads into LEO. Small launchers are usually the first\nstep to gain access to space due to their lower technical\ncomplexity. Nations that are not one of the pioneers in\nspace launches but declare an independent access to\nspace as a national strategic priority are first successful\nwith small launchers: Israel with Shavit, India with\nPSLV and GSLY, and Italy with Vega are examples.\nCommercial launch system initiatives follow the\nsame principle, as demonstrated by Orbital Sciences\nwith Pegasus XL and Minotaur, and SpaceX with\nthe Falcon launcher. In addition, a number of small\nlaunch systems are operated on the basis of former\nintercontinental ballistic missiles. Utilizing former\nweapon systems for space exploration became possible\nthough international treaties for reducing strategic\narsenals. It concerns currently only the former Soviet\nsystems like Rockot, Cosmos-3M, Dnepr, Shtil\u2019, Start-1\n\nCHO3.indd 123\n\n: eth Production of flight model Product-\nLaunch/Evaluation\n\nFigure 3.1.1: Life cycle of a\nlaunch system project.\n\nand Tsyklon-1. The Chinese small-launcher version\nof \u201cLong March\u201d (CZ-4) is also based on the building\nblocks of ballistic missiles.\n\nMedium launchers serve to place satellites into\nall Earth orbits: LEO, including polar orbits, medium\nEarth orbits (MEOs), GTOs, GEO and Earth escape\nmissions. Even though they have been operated for\ndecades, medium-sized launchers are still kept ope-\nrational in parallel to their successors with larger\npayload capacity mainly because they are optimized\nfor a specific type of mission: for example, Soyuz lifts\ncosmonauts into LEO, aside from the cargo version;\nDelta II, the new Delta IV-M and the Chinese \u201cLong\nMarch\u201d versions CZ-2 and CZ-3 serve only nationally\nprotected institutional markets. In addition, the\nChinese CZ-2F is qualified for crew transport, which\nallows China as the third nation after Russia and the\nUSA to launch people into space and safely return\nthem to Earth. Sea Launch using Zenit-SL and Ariane-\nspace using Soyuz launch vehicles are examples of the\ncommercial marketing of medium-sized launcher\nsystems. The Japanese H-IIA is one of the few examples\nof a medium-sized launcher for a newly developed\nsecond-generation system following a small-launcher\ndevelopment.\n\nHeavy-lift launch vehicles (HLLVs) mainly launch\ncommunications satellites into GTOs and are used\nspecifically for launching very heavy payloads. HLLVs\ndominate the commercial market for satellite laun-\nches. Since the founding of Arianespace in 1980, space\ntransportation has become commercial. Initially, all of\ntoday\u2019s existing launchers were used for commercial\nlaunches. Competition, especially with nations of the\nformer Soviet Union, limits commercial space trans-\nportation today to the Ariane 5, Proton, Atlas V and\nthe Japanese H-IIA-204. Delta IV-H and STS (the Space\n\n2/24/09 3:16:49 PM\n",
    "145": "CHO3.indd 124\n\n124\n\nShuttle) are used solely for institutional launches. The\ntransport of commercial payloads using the Space\nShuttle was discontinued in 1986 after the loss of the\nChallenger orbiter. As the most important strategic\nlaunch system of the USA and the only one capable\nof launching crews, the STS is thereby protected from\nany risk of loss of mission when launching commercial\nsatellites.\n\nSome representative current launcher systems are\npresented next.\n\nRockot (Figure 3.1.2, Table 3.1.2) is a launch\nsystem based on the former SS-19 intercontinental\nballistic missile. The initially two-stage missile with\nits storable propulsion systems was upgraded with an\nautonomous storable liquid-propelled upper stage\nBreeze-KM and a new telemetry system. Rockot is\nlaunched from the Russian space port of Plesetsk\nmainly into polar LEOs. The upper stage Breeze-KM\nis reignitable and thus able to lift multiple payloads\ninto different orbits with one launch. Rockot is\n\nFigure 3.1.2: Rockot (Source: EUROCKOT).\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\ncommercially available and is being marketed by the\nGerman-Russian joint venture EUROCKOT.\n\nPegasus-XL (Figure 3.1.3, Table 3.1.2) is a\nthree-stage launch system using solid propulsion and\nis air launched from a modified civil aircraft. This\nmakes it possible to reduce the required thrust level\nat liftoff, and because of the higher elevation of the\n\u201claunch pad\u201d, a longer nozzle extension can be used\nto improve the specific impulse of the first stage. In\naddition an aircraft as \u201claunch pad\u201d is geographically\nhighly flexible and enables optimized injection into\nthe desired inclination of the target orbit. A strategic\nrole is attributed to Pegasus for quickly launching\nsmall surveillance satellites when immediately needed\nby the USA. Pegasus is only used for launching in-\nstitutional payloads since its comparably high launch\ncost is not competitive.\n\nFalcon 1 (Figure 3.1.4, Table 3.1.2) is the first fully\ncommercial development of a new launch system. Fi-\nnanced to a large extent by the founder of SpaceX, it is\nsubsidized by the first launch contracts placed by the\nUS government. Falcon 1 was launched successfully\nfor the first time in 2008; it is a two-stage launcher\nusing semicryogenic propellants (LOX/kerosene). The\nlaunch site is at Kwajalein, a US military missile test\nsite in the South Pacific.\n\nVega (Figure 3.1.5, Table 3.1.2) is another example\nof a newly developed small launcher. Initiated by\nthe Italian Space Agency (ASI), Vega became an ESA\ndevelopment program. Italy makes use of the launch\nsystem experience gained in the 1980s when Scout\nrockets manufactured under license from the USA\n\nFigure 3.1.3: Pegasus XL mounted under the launching aircraft\n(Source: OSC).\n\n2/24/09 3:16:49 PM\n",

Initially qualified for crew transport,\nSoyuz is still operational for such missions, utilizing Figure 3.1.6: Soyuz (Source: ESA).\n\nCHO3.indd 125 \u00a9 2/24/09 3:16:56 PM\n",

H-IIA consists of a cryogenic\nirst stage with two or four solid propellant boost\nstages and a cryogenic upper stage.

Delta IV is operated\nby Boeing and launched both from the USA\u2019s Kennedy\nSpace Center in Florida and from Vandenberg Air\nForce Base in California.\n\nAriane 5 (Figure 3.1.11, Table 3.1.4) is a 2.5-\nstage launch system primarily used for lifting heavy\nsatellites to a GTO. Its capability of launching two\nsatellites totaling a maximum of 9000 kg to GTO is\nthe key to its commercial success. Arianespace as the\nlaunch provider has increased Ariane\u2019s share of the\ncommercial market to 60% following a drop caused\nby Russian launch systems entering the market. Two\nversions are operated today: AS5E/CA with a cryogenic\nupper stage for launching commercial payloads and\nASES-ATV for lifting the ATV supply vehicle to the\nISS. The upper stage of this version is reignitable and\nuses storable liquid propellants. Both versions use a\ncryogenic first stage and two large solid propellant\nboost stages. Ariane 5 is launched from the European\n\nFigure 3.1.11: Ariane 5 (Source: ESA).\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nCSG spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. Due\nto the proximity of its launch site to the equator (5\u00b0N)\nAriane 5 has a clear performance advantage over US\nand Russian launchers.\n\nProton (Figure 3.1.12, Table 3.1.4) is, besides\nAriane 5, the most important launcher for lifting\ncommercial payloads. Proton is a four-stage launcher\noperated from the Baikonur launch site in Russia. In\ncontrast to Soyuz-type launchers, Proton is integrated\nvertically and also transferred vertically to the launch\npad. The first three stages are propelled by storable\nliquids with identical engines that differ only in the\nlength of their nozzle extensions.

The reuse of the launch vehicle saves pro-\n\nduction costs; however, the complexity of the vehicle\n\nand the mission increase along with the necessary\n\nreturn capability. Typical objectives for reusable space\n\nlaunch systems are:\n\ne Cost reduction\n\ne Mission abort without loss of the launch vehicle\nand payload\n\ne Return of payloads to the ground\n\ne Higher reliability.\n\nHigher reliability does not directly result from reuse,\nsince the necessary return capability makes the launch\nvehicle more complex. However, a noticeable cost\nreduction can only be achieved with high reuse rates,\nwhich depend on very high system reliability. Apart\nfrom a high reuse rate, high reuse of the launch vehicle\nitself and/or its stages is necessary in order to achieve\na noticeable cost reduction.\n\nBecause of the additional effort required to get\nthe vehicle and/or stages back to Earth, reuse will\nbe limited to launches into LEO (300-600 km level\nand 0-100\u00b0 inclination), at least for the near future.\nOngoing missions (GTO/GEO, Moon, interplanetary)\nwill therefore continue to require expendable upper\nstages.\n\nIn analogy to aircraft a fully reusable single-stage\nspace transportation system which delivers its payload\ntogether with an expendable upper stage into LEO\nis regarded as a goal. Various and sometimes very\nextensive US and European technology development\nand demonstration programs have shown, however,\nthat substantial technological progress is still necessary\nbefore the target of a fully reusable single-stage vehicle\ncan be achieved, particularly concerning:\n\ne Lightweight structures (tanks and high-\ntemperature thermal protection system)\n\ne Propulsion system performance (rocket and\nair-breathing propulsion).\n\nIn the foreseeable future only multistage and partly\nreusable space transportation systems are feasible.\nThe Space Shuttle, in operation since 1981, was\nthe first step toward a reusable launch system. It is\na staged system and only partly reusable (the orbiter\nand casing of the solid propellant booster rockets).\nThe Space Shuttle achieved neither cost reductions\n\nCHO3.indd 133\n\n133\n\nnor very high reliability. The return capability did,\nhowever, enable the retrieval of payloads. Presumably\nin 2010/2011, after approximately 30 years of opera-\ntion, the Space Shuttle will be retired.\n\nFor future developments there are a multitude of\noptions which lead to a variety of conceivable solu-\ntions (Figures 3.1.15 and 3.1.16). However, options\nare limited for influencing the substantial parameters\naffecting the design, namely:\n\ne Partial or full reusability (for a majority of mis-\nsions expendable upper stages are necessary)\n\ne Number of stages\n\ne Launch and landing method (horizontal, vertical,\nwith/without propulsion, winged)\n\ne Propulsion (rocket, air-breathing propulsion,\ncombinations).\n\nBased on experience with existing launch systems,\nextensive studies and technology activities, the fol-\nlowing trends and limitations for future developments\ncan be foreseen:\n\ne Single-stage vehicles need new technologies.\n\ne Reuse of boost stages leads to limited cost savings\nwhich do not justify the development and opera-\nting expenditure.\n\ne Air-breathing propulsion is very complex and its\nintegration into the overall design is demanding.\n\ne Horizontal unpowered landing with wings is the\nfeasible solution for the return of large rocket\nstages.\n\nBesides these trends the substantial result of today\u2019s\nexperience is the insight that to master the routine,\nreliable and cost-efficient operation of a reusable\nlaunch system, extensive operational experience\nis necessary, apart from theoretical understanding.\nAccordingly, further theoretical analysis and operati-\nonal experience must progress in parallel. It is to be\nexpected that several \u201cgenerations\u201d of launch systems\nwill be necessary before operational skills of a \u201croutine\npractice\u201d level are achieved.\n\nTheoretical analyses for future developments are\nsummarized in system concepts.

The attainable level of complexity is enormous\nand the number of modeled parameters reached\n(currently about 70 000) only tentatively indicates\nthis complexity. The computed simulations are con-\ntributions toward improved understanding of possible\nfuture launch systems.\n\nBut already the definition of the optimization\ngoal requires a commitment which cannot take into\naccount all criteria of subsequent developmental\ndecisions. There is the possibility to optimize perfor-\nmance by minimizing the take-off mass of the launch\nsystem for a given payload and target orbit. However,\nminimum take-off mass does not necessarily mean\nminimum costs, and minimum costs might be the\ncosts for a single mission or those of the complete\nlife cycle of the system, including development. In\nreality, however, not everything is developed from\nscratch. The use of available components saves de-\nvelopment costs, although it can impose conditions\non components or on the entire system leading to\nsuboptimal solutions.\n\nIn a development, decision criteria which cannot\nbe incorporated into a technical or cost simulation\nmight also play a role. For a rational selection pro-\ncess, the definition of appropriate criteria and their\nweighting is essential. And weighting the decision\ncriteria often leads to the real decision.\n\nBibliography\n\n3.1.1 Arianespace. 2006/2007 Market Survey Summary, March\n\n2007.\n\n3.1.2 EUROCONSULLT.

    "157": "CHO3.indd 136\n\n136\n\n3.2.1 Introduction and Overview\n\nAs previously mentioned, launcher systems typically\nconsist of several stages. This approach makes it\npossible to optimize, in the sense of the Tsiolkovsky\nequation, the used chemical propulsion systems. After\nthe burnout of each stage it is discarded and the engine\nof the next stage is ignited. This not only reduces the\ndry mass of the rocket, but also means that the design\nof each stage can be optimized for the requirements of\nthe specific mission. An optimized staging determines\nthe amount of fuel and the engine thrust for each\nindividual stage, which has far-reaching consequences\nfor the definition of the stage architecture, the pro-\npellant combination and the propulsion system. The\ndistinguishing criteria and characteristics of staged\nlaunch systems are introduced below.\n\nLocation of Stages\n\nWhereas the lower stages are optimized for thrust or\npower, the kick stages and upper stages are optimized\nfor energy yield. For this reason, primarily cryogenic\nfuels are used in the latter (high exit velocity of the\nexhaust gas), whereas for lower stages solid fuels are\nmore common (high impulse, high ejection mass flow,\nbut low specific impulse). Kick stages only make sense\nif they either provide a significantly higher specific\nimpulse than the apogee motor of the satellite, or can\nplace it in orbit with more precision. Transfer stages\nfor lunar or planetary missions are, in contrast to\nupper stages, far better adapted to the thermal condi-\ntions in orbit. In order to protect the super-insulation\nduring ascent, transfer stages are usually located under\nthe payload fairing.\n\nLower stages are longer and often have a larger\ndiameter than rocket upper stages. The higher vol-\nume is needed to assure the high thrust required for\nascent and the associated high propellants mass flow\n(see also Section 3.1).\n\nBooster rockets can use either liquid or solid\npropellants. They are often operated in parallel with\nthe lower stage. In the case of Ariane 4, high flexi-\nbility of the payload capacity could be achieved by\nusing various combinations of liquid and solid fuel\nboosters. Both the US Atlas V and Delta IV launchers\nuse so-called common core boosters (CCBs) in their\nheavy-load versions. Smaller solid fuel boosters (for\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nDelta IV-M GEM-60 boosters) are replaced by liquid\nboosters of the same design as used for the main\nstage. This reduces production costs (learning curve,\nnumber of identical parts) as well as the acceleration\noad on the payload. However, such launchers reach\ntheir necessary final velocity only very slowly (long\nburn times for the lower stage and the booster) and\nthe control of thrust is much more complex than\nwhen solid fuel boosters are used. For Delta IV-M\nrockets, so-called \u201ccross-feeding\u201d is utilized, whereby\n\nuel is continuously pumped from the boosters to the\nprimary stage during ascent.\n\nChemical Fuels\n\nStages powered by liquid propellants have a more\ncomplex design than in the case of solid fuels, since\nadditional components and control equipment (such\nas valves, pumps and energy supply, measurement\nsystem) are necessary for the feed system, the fuel\npressurization system and for the fueling operation.\nSolid fuels are used much more frequently in boosters\nand lower stages than in upper stages due to the limi-\nted flexibility and accuracy for orbit injection. After\nsolid fuel stages have been ignited, there is normally\nno way to influence the firing duration (which is typi-\ncally two minutes), since that was already determined\nby the geometry of the fuel when it was designed and\nfabricated. In the high-performance STS or Ariane 5\nlaunchers currently in use, large solid fuel boosters\nare employed, which in the case of Ariane 5 provide\nup to 92% of the launch thrust (Figure 3.2.3). The\nAriane 5 booster EAP, with its 37 tonnes of dry mass,\nheight of 31 meters and load of 241 tonnes is one of\nthe most powerful solid fuel boosters in the world.\nEfforts are being made to lower the launch costs of\nsystems like Vega or Pegasus by extensive use of highly\nreliable solid fuel boosters.\n\nExotic propulsion concepts such as solar thermal\nor electric propulsion are only efficient in orbit and are\naccordingly only of interest for upper stages, kick stages\nor transfer stages. Air-breathing concepts require an\noxidizer from the atmosphere during ascent and the-\nrefore can only be considered for lower stages.\n\nNumber of Ignitions\nMost launcher systems are not using reignitable stages\nsince refiring the main engines is problematic and\n\n2/24/09 3:17:50 PM\n",

But the geographic position of\nthe launch site is not always ideal for the desired\nsatellite orbit, which requires that the upper stage be\nreignited because of the limited power of the launch\nsystem. Examples are the need to inject directly into\nanear-GEO orbit, or the descent of a stage to force its\nreentry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The Centaur upper\nstage of the Delta and Atlas launcher systems can be\nreignited, likewise the EPS-V upper stage of Ariane 5\nand the Breeze and Block-DM upper stages of Russia\u2019s\nProton rocket.\n\nReusability\n\nMost launcher systems employed today have stages\nwhich cannot be reused, with the exception of the\nSpace Shuttle orbiter. Fully reusable rockets do not\nexist at present.\n\nFuel Tank Architecture\n\nOne, but often several, fuel tanks are used for liquid\nsystems (Figure 3.2.2). A distinction can be made\nbetween architectures in which all tanks are positioned\nin a central axis one above the other (1), or in which\nthe tanks are toroidally and centrally positioned (2), or\noutcentered, circling the longitudinal axis of the rocket\n\nCHO3.indd 137\n\nstage (3). Another question concerns which propellant\nto position closest to the engine. In order to locate the\ncenter of gravity toward the top, in the case of cryogenic\npropellants it is theoretically desirable to position the\nhydrogen tank closer to the engine in order to exploit\nthe taller tank height of the hydrogen and the greater\nweight of the oxygen for effective thrust vector control.\nNevertheless, for cryogenic upper stages the opposite\nis usually done (e.g., for the Centaur and ESC-A\nupper stages), since a heavy oxygen tank mounted\nbelow the hydrogen tank yields a smaller dimensioning\nloadcase and thus a lower mass for this stage.\n\nFor solid fuel stages and boosters the engine\nhousing fulfills the two functions of fuel storage and\ncombustion chamber. For large solid fuel boosters, as\nin Ariane EAP (Figure 3.2.3), the stage is produced in\nseparate segments for manufacturing, transport and\nsafety reasons and joined together only shortly before\nintegration into the launcher .\n\nStage Autonomy\n\nWhereas the US and European launcher systems\nusually position the on-board computer and avionics\ncentrally in the upper stage of the launcher, Russian\nlaunchers often implement an autonomous approach\n\n2/24/09 3:17:50 PM\n",

Only a low degree of autonomy has\nbeen realized in the Ariane launcher system in order to\nkeep launcher mass low and systems reliability high.\n\nMass Index\nSince propellants is constantly consumed during ope-\nration of the stage engines, the total mass of the rocket\n\nsteadily decreases. If the thrust remains constant, then\nthe acceleration of the rocket increases until engine\nburnout. According to the Tsiolkovsky equation, the\nincrease in velocity of a rocket Avis a function of the\nescape velocity and the mass ratio M,/(M, \u2014 Mp), with\nM, being the rocket mass at the time of ignition and\nMp the propellant mass consumed between ignition\nand burnout.

For this reason the dry mass\nof a stage should in principle be as low as possible.\nThis value is accordingly taken as an indicator of the\nquality of performance optimization of a rocket stage.\nThe technological effort required is always higher for\nan upper than for a lower stage, since the propellant\nmass is lower.

Such a neutralization maneuver is,\nhowever, only initialized prior to reaching a stable\norbit, since the particles and pieces would endanger\nother spacecraft as space debris.\n\nBallistic Phases and Reignitions\n\nFor the coming years a need for upper stages with\n\nmultiple reignition capability is predicted. With\n\nreignitable upper stages satellites can be placed very\nclose to their final orbit and the propellant stored\nin the satellite can be used for other purposes than\nfor transfer or circularization maneuvers. Further\napplications for reignitions are resupply flights to\nthe International Space Station (ISS), after which the\nupper stage needs to abandon the ISS orbit.\n\nThe capability to reignite a rocket upper stage\nrequires that:\n\ne The engine must be capable of reignition.\n\ne The propellants must be at the right pressure and\ntemperature for the engine.\n\ne The stage must remain operational for a long\ntime; energy supply and propellant losses due to\nvaporization must be taken into account.\n\ne The stage must be able to navigate and balance\ndisturbances in order to ensure maintenance of the\nrequired orbit (attitude control, avionics).\n\nThe capability to allow reignition is significantly de-\ntermined by the engine and the applied propellant\ncombination. In the case of nonhypergolic propellant\ncombinations an additional ignition system for the\ncombustion chamber and a potentially available gas\ngenerator are required.\n\nFor the ignition and during the ignition transient\nsufficient propellant needs to be available to supply\nthe engine. If the liquid propellants are not retained\nwithin the lines and at the tank outlet, they will be\narbitrarily distributed throughout the tank after a\nballistic flight phase.\n\nFor correct reignition and operation of an engine,\na sufficient quantity of the propellants needs to be\navailable at the tank outlet (Figure 3.2.6).\n\nBasically there are two possibilities to position\nthe propellants:\n\nCHO3.indd 141\n\n141\n\nFigure 3.2.6: Liquid distribution within a propellant tank after\nshutdown of the main engine. (Source: EADS).\n\ne The propellant tank or the stage is able to collect\na sufficient quantity of propellants at the tank\noutlet by itself; for example, by implementation\nof appropriate propellant management devices\n(PMDs) such as surface tension tanks.\n\ne The propellant needs to be settled at the tank\noutlet by specific attitude maneuvers realized with\nsmall thrusters.\n\nAfter successful ignition the upper stage is accelerated\nby the thrust of the engine, which also causes settling\nof the remaining propellants at the tank outlet.\nEspecially with a high thrust level at the main en-\ngines, considerable sloshing (geyser effect) at engine\nshutdown may occur due to the rapidly changing ac-\nceleration vector, which can result in heavy bubble for-\nmation within the propellant and, as a consequence,\n\na propellant quality which is no longer suitable for\nthe engine. Maneuvers for attitude control or payload\nseparation act in a similar way; they are always associ-\nated with a turning of the stage or a counter impulse\nat the instant of payload separation. In all these cases\nthe propellant is induced to slosh.\n\nThe ballistic flight phase which precedes reigniti-\non can have, depending on its duration, a significant\nimpact on the conceptual design of an upper stage.\nSmall, continuous consumption of all kinds, such as\npressurants or electricity for navigation or data acqui-\nsition, requires additional storage capacity.\n\n2/24/09 3:17:55 PM\n",

While the heat impact in the case\nof storable propellants is of less importance, it has\nfundamental importance in the case of cryogenic\npropellants. With these propellants heat loads cause\nan increase of the propellant temperature and cor-\nresponding steady evaporation. A possibility to further\nutilize heated propellant is the dedicated depressur-\nization maneuver of the propellant tanks. During\nthis maneuver the propellant temperature is forced to\ncorrespond to the pressure inside the tanks (relation of\ntemperature versus pressure according to the saturati-\non curve). However, boil-off losses occur during such\nmaneuvers, which reduce the amount of fuel available\nfor propulsion. The application of thermal insulation\nhas a technical limit, which restricts the duration and\nnumber of ballistic flight phases with subsequent\nreignitions (especially for long-duration missions).\n\n3.2.3 Components and Subsystems\n\nThe main subsystems of rocket stages are described\nbelow.

It includes all those components\nwhich contribute to thrust generation. An overview\nof propulsion systems and engine cycles is given in\ntable 3.2.3. The number of engines is a major design\nconsideration affecting the functional requirements for\nthe tank and the mechanical interface with the stage,\nwhich is the function of the so-called thrust frame. The\nturbopump inlet is the functional boundary between\nthe engine and the stage propulsion systems. With more\nengines, less space is available for positioning auxiliary\ndevices and supplementary tanks, for example for\npressurized gas supply. Thrust vector control and the\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nfeed line routing become more complex.

The high-\nenergy propellant now employed primarily in the upper\nstages are liquefied gases utilized at the saturation point\nof its vapor pressure curve. These liquids have a low\nboiling point and are extremely sensitive to heat loads\nintroduced by the tank structure or feed lines. If the heat\ninput upstream of the turbopump is too high, sponta-\nneous vaporization may occur at the pump inlet. This\nso-called cavitation can lead to irreversible damage to\nthe pump and must therefore be avoided. To prevent\nthis effect, boost pumps are sometimes used inside the\ntank sump, to provide the necessary upstream pressure\nof the turbopumps, while at the same time keeping\nthe pressure in the fuel tank at a low level.\n\nTank Pressurization System\n\nThe tank pressurization system supplies the propellant\ntanks with the amount of pressurized gases required\nto provide the needed upstream pressure for the\nengine propellant pumps (1-5 bar), or in the case of\npressure fed systems feed, at the engine inlet pressure\n(10-30 bar). The stage tanks are pressurized to the\nminimal extent required for the engine either already\non the ground (lower stages) or during ascent.

Inert gases, gaseous fuel combustion pro-\nducts or vaporized fuel are used as the pressurization\ngas. Vaporized fuel is obtained either from the main\nengine or from a separate gas generator, or induced\nin the ullage volume by regulated introduction of a\nhypergolic liquid. Inert gas has to be carried along in\neither gaseous or liquid form. Gaseous storage of he-\nium in pressurized tanks (>200 bar) at 300 K ambient\ntemperature or at low temperatures (77-150 K) is the\nusual choice. Helium is also used as a supercritical fluid\nat extremely low temperatures (4.2\u201410 K), for example\nor the lower stage EPC of Ariane 5.

The third\npressurization approach, using combustion products,\nis an option primarily for small, military rockets.\n\nPropellant Tanks\n\nThe stage tanks store the propellant until it is burned\nin the engine to generate thrust. For solid fuel propul-\nsion systems the tank is an integral component of the\npropulsion system. Because of the typically large fuel\nvolume (especially in the case of cryogenic hydrogen,\nwhich has a density of about 70 kg/m\u201d), the fuel tanks\n\nCHO3.indd 145\n\n145\n\nare responsible for a large part of the stage\u2019s total struc-\ntural mass (see also Table 3.2.1). For this reason they\nare usually monocoque constructions with thin walls.\nFor cryogenic fuels, metallic materials are exclusively\nused at present, mostly aluminum alloys (titanium is\nincompatible with oxygen, and tanks reinforced with\ncarbon fibers are still at an early stage of development).\nThe tanks internal pressure helps to stabilize the walls\nagainst the usual bending and compression fluxes\n(balloon principle). The tank wall is usually load\ncarrying regarding mechanical launcher loads; hence\nthe tank walls and adjacent structures in the load path\nare strengthened with ribs or rings. When cryogenic\nfuels are stored, the tanks must be well insulated to\nkeep evaporation losses low for gases which have been\npreviously liquefied with considerable effort. In the\ncase of a common bulkhead, either inner insulation\nor an evacuated tank bulkhead (as for the H10 upper\nstage of Ariane 4) can be used. Normally, cryogenic\ntanks are insulated externally with insulation foam\nwith a low heat conduction coefficient and compo-\nsite materials (MLI foil and fleece). Optimization is\na challenge because of the loads in the launch and\nascent phases. Operation times are limited by the un-\navoidable evaporation of the propellant. Besides lines\nfor pressurization, fueling and supplying the engines,\na number of devices are also located inside the tank.\nThese are devices to position the fuel (PMD), suppress\nsloshing and swirling, and instruments to measure\npressure, temperature, filling level, and possibly boost\npumps to increase the feed pressure (Figure 3.2.10).\n\nHaving a common bulk head can help to reduce\nboth stage height and dry mass. If cryogenic fuels\nare used, then because of the temperature difference\nbetween hydrogen and oxygen there must be suitable\nthermal insulation between the respective tank sec-\ntions. For a pressure-stabilized common bulkhead, a\npermanent positive tank pressure differential must\nbe assured from the concave to the convex side of\nthe tank.\n\nStructures\n\nThere are other structures integrated in the rocket stage\nin addition to the tanks for propellant and for the inert\ngases and additives which must be carried along. These\ninclude interstage structures connecting the stages,\nintertank structures between the various propellant\ntanks, housing for the stage avionics (in the vehicle\n\n2/24/09 3:18:00 PM\n",

These structures can be\neither monocoque or framework constructions. Either\nmetallic materials or carbon fiber composites are used.\nMetal structures have the advantage that equipment,\nsupports and lines can be easily attached; for fiber\ncomposites special inserts for screws and rivets must\nbe provided. Fiber composites have the advantage of\nlow heat conductivity. But if the structures are not too\nshort or flat, then framework-supporting structures are\npreferred. If the rods are long, vibration dampers have\nto be included. If the installation angle is too high or the\nrods are too short, then the lateral loads must be absor-\nbed in some manner, for example by using cross-beams\nor rings. Figure 3.2.11 shows typical design options\nusing the example of two-engine thrust frames.\n\nReaction Control System\n\nThe functions of the reaction control system (RCS)\nusing small thrusters range from attitude control to\npre-acceleration, the settling of liquid propellant, to\nproviding a velocity increment to separate stages and\n\npayloads, to carrying out maneuvers and to achieving\nsmall changes to the orbit (Table 3.2.4; see also Figures\n3.2.13 to 3.2.14). There is more information on small\nthrusters in Section 4.4. A basic distinction is made\nbetween cold and hot gas systems. One characteristic\nis the use of stage fuel for attitude control, either by\ncombistion the fuel or by exploiting the pressure from\nthe ullage of the fuel tank with the help of small thrus-\nters. The latter approach is often found in cryogenic\nstages in order to make some use of the continuous\nand unavoidable evaporation losses.\n\nAvionics and Energy Supply\n\nThe avionics and parts of the energy supply system\nare usually housed on a special platform, the vehicle\nequipment bay, and can be designed either centrally\nfor the whole rocket or decentrally for each stage.\nEssential avionic components are the on-board com-\nputer; the flight control, telemetry and navigation\nsystems; and the system for launch pad safety.

    "170": "3.2 Multistage Rocket Technologies.\n\nfor stage separation and at the same time the two stage\nsegments are forced away from each other by spring\nforce. In addition, small engines are often activated to\naccelerate the remaining launcher and separate it from\nthe separated stage, or alternatively hinder the separa-\nted stage from continuing in the flight direction.\n\nThrust Vector Control and Actuators\n\nThe flight path of rockets has to be controlled and\nadjusted as long as they are in operation. Disturbances\nduring the ascent, for example caused by wind, or by\nunbalanced centre of gravity position of the latincher,\nrelated to the pressure stagnation point and to the thrust\nvector have to be compensated. In rockets this is usually\naccomplished with the help of a thrust vector control\nsystem. Whereas aerodynamic stabilizer fin control\n(either in the air stream or in the engine jet stream)\nis only used today for small ballistic rockets. Small\nengines are effective for thrust control if they have a\nsufficiently high thrust level and efficient positioning in\ncomparison to the main engine. Influencing the thrust\nvector by injecting a liquid into the diverging part\nof the nozzle is done in solid fuel boosters or stages.\nSwiveling mechanisms \u2014 usually Cardan suspension, a\nball-bearing joint, or a notch \u2014 are used together with\nelectromechanical or hydraulic actuators both for\nsolid- and liquid-fueled stages. Their advantage over\nother designs is the very slight thrust reduction caused\nby the swiveling. The ESC-A upper stage of Ariane 5\nuses a hydraulic-mechanical system, whereas in the\nCentaur launcher hydraulic actuators are used in the\ntwo-engine version and electromechanical ones in the\none-engine version. If swiveling engines are used for\nliquid-fueled engines, then flexible or jointed lines have\nto be used for fuel feed in order to accommodate the\nswivel. Some Russian stages use the fuel to control the\nactuators instead of having a separate hydraulic fluid.\nIn the case of several engines or large strap-on boosters,\nas in Ariane 5, these are frequently used to control the\nroll of the launcher during ascent.\n\nPneumatic Command System\n\nThe pneumatic control system provides the mass flow\nand pressure to operate valves. It is primarily used in\ncryogenic systems for safety reasons (reduced risk of\nexplosion in the case of leakage). Helium is typically\nemployed as a neutral inert gas.\n\nCHO3.indd 149\n\n149\n\n3.2.4 Stage System Design Process\nand Technology\n\nThe design of a rocket stage has on the one hand\nto comply with all the requirements for the overall\n(launcher) system, such as main dimensions, perfor-\nmance and environmental and operating loads, and\non the other hand all stage-internal subsystems such\nas propellant tanks, propulsions system, structures\nand control systems must be harmonized to form an\noptimized unit.\n\nThe stage contractor is accordingly responsible for\nthe requirements and specifications of all equipment\nto be developed on the stage level, such as valves, lines\nand thermal insulation. The main subsystems are\ndescribed in the following sections.\n\n3.2.4.1 Design of the Overall Stage System\n\nThe main requirements for each stage, such as dry\nmass, engine thrust and the overall dimensions, are\ndetermined in the context of launcher analysis and\nforwarded to the stage contractors in the form of a\npreliminary specification.\n\nThese main requirements are the basis for the\ndesign of each stage. The architecture of the propel-\nlant tanks is critical, as it directly impacts the main\ndimensions of the stage and its dry mass. The volume\nsizing of the propellant tanks is determined by the\npropellant budget (Table 3.2.5). The mixture ratio of\noxidizer and fuel depends on the choice of propellants\nand the type of engine. Consideration of the transient\nconsumption for ignition and shutdown finally yield\nthe total mass of loaded propellant. The final tank\nvolume is determined by considering contingencies\n\nTable 3.2.5: Propellant budget of the Ariane 5 EPS.\n\nContributions N,0, [kg] MMH [kg]\nIgnition transient 3.5 1.5\nUsable propellant 6362.0 3105.0\nPerformance reserve 148.0 101.0\nShutdown transient 7.0 2.5\nResiduals in tanks and 25.5 11.0\nlines\n\nLoaded propellant 6546.0 3221.0\nmass\n\n2/24/09 3:18:11 PM\n",

In a next step\nthe pressure distribution in the propulsion system\nis investigated and the layout for the pressurization\nsystem is chosen.\n\nIn most cases the pressurization system is com-\nbined with the pneumatic command system for valve\nactivation. The activation of the pneumatic valves\nis initiated by the on-board computer. The amount\nof the pressurized gas mass is determined by the\nequivalence of mass within the \u201cempty\u201d propellant\ntanks at the end of the mission, complemented by\ncontingencies for consumption of secondary order\nand losses.\n\nThe simplest way to supply the propellant tan!\nwith pressurized gas is the application of a high-\npressure vessel (often with helium storage) and\ndepressurization to the required pressure levels of the\npropellant tanks via one or more pressure reducers.\n\nThis procedure has the disadvantage that the\npressurized gas cools down during operation and the\npressurization efficiency is reduced, which increases\nthe amount of the pressurant mass. Alternatively,\nliquefied gases, such as hydrogen or helium, can be\nheated up at the operating (hot) engine and then\nsupplied to the propellant tanks as the pressurant.\n\nConcurrent to the design of the propulsion sys-\ntem, a mass budget (Table 3.2.6) for the overall stage\nis established, which comprises all elements of the\ncomplete stage. This mass budget is elaborated in\na first step by simple hand calculations, data from\ncatalogs and scaling equipment from already-built\nand similar rocket stages; in a later step during the\n\na\n\nTable 3.2.6: Mass budget of the Ariane 5 EPS (dry mass).\n\nSubsystems Mass [kg]\n\nStructures 342.3\nPropellant tanks 422.0\nPropulsion system (incl. engine) 339.2\nLines 28.2\nElectrical system 23.3\nPyrotechnical system 11.1\nSupports and bolts 55.4\nThermal insulation 34.9\nTotal mass 1256.4\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\ndevelopment the preliminary mass budget is adjus-\nted to the latest mass assessments from the hardware\ndevelopment. In case the requirements for dry mass\ncannot be fulfilled, the intended stage design is chec-\nked and the potential for mass savings identified. This\nprocess is iterative and can lead to a redesign of some\nsubsystems or the complete stage.\n\n3.2.4.2 Impacts on the System Design\n\nDuring the design of the stage systems several influ-\nences internally and externally to the stage have to\nbe considered. Some of the important impacts are\ndescribed in more detail below.\n\nLoads\n\nA distinction is made between mechanical and ther-\nmal loads; both types are further subdivided into envi-\nronmental and operational loads. The determination\nof loads is performed individually according to the\nnature of their origin on either the stage or system\nlevel. Basically a stage must be designed to sustain all\nloads (including safety factors).\n\nMechanical Loads\n\nThe mechanical loads for the primary structures of\neach stage are determined on the launcher level, since\nthe interactions of all stages need to be considered. The\nresult of this coupled analysis is the requirements and\ninputs for the static and dynamic load assumption for\nthe development of each stage.\n\nExternal loads and self-induced and operation\nloads are combined at the stage level. This is done\nby superpositioning the external and internal loads\nof the stage, such as tank pressure loads and loads\ncoming from operation of the engine, after which a\ndimensioning load case can be determined.\n\nThermal Loads\nA distinction must be made between thermal environ-\nmental loads on the ground and those arising during\nthe different flight phases. During the ground phase\nthe launcher is exposed to the thermal environment\nof the launch site; the outer surface of the launcher is\nin direct contact with the external environment.\nDuring the ascent phase the outer surface warms\nup due to air friction. If this heating up results in\n\n2/24/09 3:18:11 PM\n",
    "172": "3.2 Multistage Rocket Technologiess\n\nunacceptable temperatures for the material of the\nstructures, they need to be insulated. Special care is\nrequired for the areas of protuberances, as they sig-\nnificantly heat up during ascent.\n\nDuring the active boost phase of the upper stage\nit is exposed to heat radiation coming from the hot\nnozzle (>1000K) and the thermal conditions of the\nspace environment. Depending on the architecture of\nthe stage, the heat radiated from the engine nozzle is\nof importance, as all equipment near the nozzle will\nsignificantly warm up. In order to reduce this effect,\na typical countermeasure is the implementation of\na heat shield, which reduces the view area of the hot\nnozzle and thus the need for insulation.\n\nDuring the payload separation phase, only loads\nfrom the space environment have an effect; these can\nlead to a temperature increase or decrease depending\non the location.\n\nInfluences from Fluid Mechanics on Tanks\n\nand Lines\n\nFluid dynamic effects in the propellant tanks comprise\nmainly the thermodynamic conditions in the gaseous\nphase of the tanks, as well as sloshing effects and,\nspecifically for cryogenic propellants, subcooling or\nwarmup at the tank walls. For detailed dimensioning\nof these effects tests are unavoidable.\n\nThe thermodynamic conditions within the gas\nphase have via the ullage temperature a direct impact\non the required amount of pressurized gas. For detai-\nled determination of the required mass of pressurized\ngas, a thermodynamic model of the tanks is usually\ndrawn up. The main parameters are the compression\nof the pressurized gas and the heat exchange within\nthe gas phase with the propellant and tank walls.\n\nSloshing of propellants, initiated by internal or\nexternal loads, impacts the trajectory (disturbance\nforces) as well as the thermodynamic state within the\nullage volume.\n\nThese mixing effects between propellant and ullage\ngas require tests for detailed assessment. Sloshing\ninside the tanks can be avoided or reduced by apply-\ning so-called antisloshing devices. Their geometry\ndepends on the physical properties of the propellants\nand the required damping. An antisloshing device\nat the tank outlet of the Ariane 5 EPS is shown in\nFigure 3.2.15.\n\nCHO3.indd 151\n\n151\n\nFigure 3.2.15: Antisloshing device of the Ariane 5 EPS upper stage\n(Source: ASTRIUM).\n\nFluid dynamic effects within the feed lines are\nless complex. In the case of storable propellants the\napplication of one-dimensional calculation schemes\nis sufficient. In the case of cryogenic propellants a\ntwo-phase flow approach for transient behavior is\nrequired.\n\nInfluences from Aerodynamics and Trajectory\nAerodynamic effects, in a strict sense, are not a specific\nissue for a launcher, as the lift force is provided by\nthe thrust of the engine and no other devices exist\nto create any lift forces. However, the stagnation\npressure during the ascent phase is of importance,\nas drag forces directly impact the propulsion needed\nand affect the temperature of the external surfaces\nof the launcher. In order to protect the payload from\nstagnation pressure and temperature increase due to\nheating up, and in addition to reduce drag, the nose\nof the rocket (fairing) is aerodynamically shaped.\nHowever, this fairing is jettisoned as soon as the stag-\nnation pressure is low enough to reduce the mass of\nthe launcher.\n\nPollution/Cleanliness/Leakage\n\nThe term pollution summarizes contamination of\nall types coming from the launcher or the individual\nstages and released during ascent. The focus of these\ndiscussions is the contamination of the payload.\nAccordingly, requirements concerning contamina-\ntion are driven by the payload. Contamination of\nthe payload, for example the solar panels, has to be\n\n2/24/09 3:18:12 PM\n",
    "173": "152\n\nprevented in order to avoid degradation of perfor-\nmance. Pollution of the payload can occur only after\nthe payload protection (fairing) has been jettisoned,\nand when there is no axial acceleration. The sources of\ncontamination for the payload are small particles and\nalso molecules released from materials of the upper\nstage by outgassing. Furthermore, the operation of the\nRCS could be a source of potential contamination.\n\nBy \u201ccleanliness\u201d the internal pollution level of the\nstage is meant. The correct operation of the propul-\nsion system of a launcher stage can be ensured only\nif the internal cleanliness level of all components,\nsuch as tanks, lines, valves and engine, satisfies the\nrequirements. The required cleanliness level is derived\nfrom what is required to ensure the correct operation\nof valves and engines. This cleanliness level must then\nbe ensured throughout the entire pressurization and\npropulsion system. This means that lines, equipment\nand also tanks need to be specifically cleaned and their\ncleanliness verified. The cleanliness requirements are\nverified as the allowable amount of particles within a\ndefined volume of the cleaning fluid. Typical cleanli-\nness requirements for lines of the propulsion system\nof a launcher stage are summarized in Table 3.2.7.\n\nThe use of filters within the propulsion system\nis avoided in most cases in order to avoid the risk of\npartial or complete clogging resulting in an undefined\nincrease in hydraulic pressure losses.\n\n\u201cLeakage\u201d describes the release of pressurized gases\nand propellants from lines and line connections. The\nimpact ofa leak can vary: leakage in the pressurization\nsystem corresponds to an unintended loss, while lea-\nkage in the propellant circuits can result in explosive\nmixtures within closed volumes.\n\nFor unavoidable leakage a specific \u201cleakage bud-\nget\u201d has to be established. Measures to minimize\nleakages are the application of appropriate connection\n\nTable 3.2.7: Allowed particles in 100 ml of cleaning fluid.\n\nParticle size [ym] Amount\n<25 No limit\n26-50 <15\n51-100 <5\n101-200 <1\n>201 0\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nelements and a tightness verification during acceptance\ntesting of components and line circuits. Typical tight-\nness requirements during acceptance testing of con-\nnection elements by application of helium are in the\nrange of 10 \u00b0cm\u2019/s.\n\n3.2.4.3 Subsystem Design\n\nThermal Design\n\nThe objective of the thermal design of launcher stages\nis to ensure acceptable temperature conditions for\nall equipment during all ground and flight phases.\nThis analysis starts with the identification of all heat\nsources and sinks and in a next step, if possible, with\nan appropriate positioning of all equipment.\n\nAfter the stage configuration is sufficiently advan-\nced, a thermal mathematical model is established,\nwhich comprises all main components and structures.\nThermal environmental conditions are then used to\ncalculate the temperature distributions as a function\nof time for all components. The evaluation of these\ntemperature distributions regarding the minimum\nand maximum temperature identifies the need for\ncountermeasures. In case components already exceed\ntheir allowed temperature range during the ground\nphase, a conditioning by flushing with warm or cold\ngas, in most cases nitrogen or helium, is applied. These\nflushing gases are supplied from the ground facilities\nat the launch area and are no longer available after\nliftoff. During the flight phase only the application\nof insulation or capacitive cooling elements remains\nfeasible. The application of electrical heaters is limited\nbecause of their additional electric power need.\n\nThermofunctional Design\n\nThe thermofunctional design of tanks and lines con-\ntaining propellant is specific for cryogenic stages.\nThe focus of these considerations is the warming up\nof the propellants due to heat loads which result in\nan increase of the vapor pressure and a decrease of\nthe propellant density. The latter causes a mixture\nratio shift of the engine, which can result in a reduc-\ntion of the specific impulse and an increase of the\ntemperature inside the combustion chamber. While\nthe reduction of the specific impulse affects only\nthe stage performance, the increase of combustion\ntemperature can result in damage to the combustion\n\n2/24/09 3:18:12 PM\n",

In the case of cryogenic propellants the\nthermal residuals in the tanks need to be minimized.\nDesign aspects which reduce heat input are the stage\narchitecture, the shape of the tanks and thermal insu-\nlation on the outer wall, in specific cases also on the\ninner wall of the tanks.\n\nGeometrical Design and Layout\n\nAfter finalization of the staging of the launcher, posi-\ntioning of the control units and the tank configurations\nand connecting structures, the geometrical design of\neach launcher stage is started. The accommodation\nof stage equipment is accompanied by comparative\nstudies (trade-offs). However, the accommodation\nof stage equipment remains an iterative process, as\ncounteractions between the positioning of equipment\ncan only be identified in the total layout.\n\nThe design process of a component or subsystem\nstarts with layout schematics, which are then revie-\nwed with respect to requirements and mass. When\nall requirements are met a design definition drawing\nof the concerned area is elaborated which comprises\nall essential details. As a last step interface drawings,\nmanufacturing drawings and integration drawings\nare made. The described procedure is similar for each\nsubsystem. If a component cannot be defined because\nits development is still underway, the design work is\nstarted using an envelope volume representative of\nthe main dimensions and interfaces. According to\nthe progress of the development of a component, this\nenvelope volume is replaced with evermore precise\ndefinitions of the component.\n\nIn order to keep the later production costs low,\nsimple and low-cost design (design to budget) needs\nto be considered from the start of the development.\nAlso, the later integration process needs to be consi-\ndered from the beginning in order to ensure a final\nintegration process free of disturbances. A definition\ndrawing of the EPS upper stage of the Ariane 5 is\nshown in Figure 3.2.16, while Figure 3.2.17 shows the\nfinal product after finalization of the development.\n\nMechanical Design\n\nAfter finalization of the definition of the main struc-\ntural elements, they are designed using mathematical\nmodels together with the load requirements from\nthe launcher analysis and loads coming from the\n\nCHO3.indd 153\n\n153\n\nFigure 3.2.16: Definition drawing of the Ariane 5 EPS (Source:\n\nFADS).\n\noperation of the stage. The result of the design process\nis the geometrical definition and the definition of the\nrequired thickness of the materials. The choice of\nthe applied material is in most cases determined by\nmanufacturing processes or predefined costs. After\nthe design of all main structural elements, static and\nlater dynamic mathematical models of these items\nare elaborated. By means of the static model and\nunder consideration of the loads, the safety factors\nagainst overload are determined. With the help of\nthe dynamic model and the dynamic excitations at\nthe stage interfaces, the mechanical responses at all\nnecessary stage internal locations are determined.\nThe result of these calculations yields the local loads\nat particular locations, such as between lines and\ncomponents, which are then used for further local\nanalysis and design.\n\nDuring the mechanical design process of a laun-\ncher stage other loads also need to be considered which\nare caused by shocks, vibrations and acoustic noise.\nThese loads are sometimes challenging and, especially\nfor sensitive components, can require the application\nof specifically developed damping elements.\n\nDesign of the Flight Control System\n\nThe flight control is in most cases performed by\na central control unit (on-board computer) for\nthe complete launcher.

The requirements\nfor these control elements are determined on the\nlauncher system level and comprise data about the\nthrust level, minimum thrust impulse as well as the\ntotal required impulse.\n\nThe control system continuously acquires in-\nformation from each stage which allows assessment\nof the correct operating conditions. The acquired\ninformation includes the launcher acceleration, the\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nengine chamber pressure, the filling level of the pro-\npellants inside the tanks and the trajectory. In case\nthe monitored parameters are outside their predicted\nrange, a premature shutdown of the concerned stage\ncan be initiated.\n\nStage Optimization and Performance\nDetermination\n\nThe performance of a launcher is determined by\nthe payload mass which can be injected into a pre-\ndefined orbit. All relevant data such as dry mass,\ncenter of gravity, characteristic of the thrust profile,\netc., for all stages is then processed in a trajec-\ntory program and all parameters of the trajectory\nare then determined. In case the required payload\nmass cannot be reached, measures to increase the\npayload capability are sought, such as reduction of\nthe dry mass of the stages and optimization of such\noperating parameters as thrust level, mixture ratio,\npropellant residual masses or specific impulse. The\nobjective of the optimization process is to minimize\nthe mass of each stage at shutdown. Besides the dry\nmass of each stage, the propellant residual masses\nhave a large impact. This concerns especially cryo-\ngenic stages which form thermal residuals caused\nby heat entry.\n\n3.3 Propulsion Systems\n\nDirk Rideger Albat, Oskar Josef Haidn and\nGiinter Langel\n\nPropulsion systems for rocket engines are discrim-\ninated according to their propellant combinations:\nsolid, liquid and, as a combination of both, hybrid\npropulsion systems. Liquid propulsion systems are\nsubdivided into monopropellant and bipropellant\nsystems. The first are designed as cold gas systems or\napply catalysts to decompose the fuel. Examples of\ntypical monopropellant systems are hydrazine (N,H,)\nor nitrous oxide (N,O). Bipropellant systems have a\nbroad variety of oxidizers and fuels, see Section 3.3.1.2.\nDepending on mission requirement and staging of\nthe launcher, the different propulsion systems can be\n\n2/24/09 3:18:13 PM\n",

The resulting\nhigh pressures and temperatures of the reactants the\ndesired thrust in the chamber and produce nozzle\n(see Figure 3.3.1).\n\nFigure 3.3.1: Vulcain 2 engine at P5 test facility in Lampoldshausen\n(Source: ESA).\n\nCHO3.indd 155\n\n155\n\n3.3.1.1 Basic Equation\n\nThe basic relationship, called the rocket equation, was\nfirst derived in 1903 by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and\ndescribes the principles of rocket propulsion. One-\ndimensional flow, see Figure 3.3.2, yields the thrust\nof such a system:\n\nF= tit tg + (Pa Poo) Ay [N] (3.3.1)\nwith u, and p, the velocity and the pressure of the\nexhaust gases at the nozzle exit A,, and p,, the ambient\npressure.

A more detailed\nlook at the characteristic velocity c* and the thrust\ncoefficient C, reveals the effect of fluid proper-\nties and operating conditions on the thrust rela-\ntion (Equation 3.3.2). The characteristic velocity\nc* relates the combustion chamber pressure to the\namounts of propellants burnt and thus reflects the\nfuel energy and the combustion efficiency. Equation\n3.3.4 shows that c* increases with the gas tempera-\nture T, in the thrust chamber but decreases with the\n\nFigure 3.3.2: Principle of an ideal rocket.\n\n2/24/09 3:18:26 PM\n",

Table 3.3.1 summarizes the range\nof variation of characteristic coefficients for rocket\nengines.\n\n3.3.1.2 Propellants\n\nThe equations and the arguments about the char-\nacteristic velocity and thrust coefficient mentioned\npreviously allow for a propellant classification. The\ngoal is to achieve high combustion chamber tem-\nperatures, and low molecular weight of the reactants.\nFurthermore, the propellant choice might depend\non its density or temperature, the engine cycle, or on\ncertain mission requirements. While the combination\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nof H,/O, is generally considered the best choice for\nupper stage engines, kerosene/LOX (LOX = liquid\nO,) or solid propellants are frequently preferred for\nbooster engines, which operate primarily within the\natmosphere.\n\nAlthough from a performance point of view a\nbroad variety of propellant combinations are fea-\nsible, only the most frequently used are presented\nhere; for more information see [3.3.1]. Hypergolic\ncombinations of N,O, with different hydrazine\ncompoiind and derivatives have been frequently used\nfor a long time because of their superior storability\ndespite their minor performance values, serious\ntoxicity issues and related handling problems. In the\nmeantime LOX/kerosene has become the combina-\ntion of choice for large liquid propellant booster\nengines; the most impressive engines are the Fl\nengine of the Saturn V and members of the RD-170\nengine family.\n\nThe influence of mixture ratio and propellant\ncombination on the specific impulse of an engine\nis depicted in Figure 3.3.3 and allows classification\nof the propellants. The cryogenic propellant pair of\nhydrogen and oxygen exceeds by far (30%) any other\ncombination. Oxygen and simple hydrocarbons such\nas methane, propane or kerosene build a group of\npropellants with similar performance. Within this\ngroup the specific impulse decreases with an increas-\ning number of carbon atoms. Pairings of oxygen and\nsimple alcohols build a second group with perfor-\nmance values similar to the hypergolic mixtures, such\nas N,O, and MMH, with about a 10% performance\ndecline. For comparison Figure 3.3.3 also shows the\nperformance of kerosene and ethanol with 90% hy-\ndrogen peroxide (H,O,).\n\n3.3.2 Types of Engines\n\nRocket engine cycles are mainly divided into three\ncategories according to their fuel feeding technologies,\nsee Figure 3.3.4. Engines requiring lower power levels\nare mainly fed using tank pressurization via gas stored\nin high-pressure tanks, while most of the engines used\nin launchers work with turbomachinery to provide\nelevated combustion chamber pressure.\n\n2/24/09 3:18:42 PM\n",

For pump-fed engines\nthe principle of turbochargers is usually applied. Hot\ngas is produced in a gas generator and expanded ina\nturbine to operate the pumps to increase the propel-\nlant pressure. If after expansion the gas is led into the\nmain combustion chamber the cycle is called staged\ncombustion; if the hot gas is fed through external\nexhaust pipes the system is called a gas generator cycle.\nThere are two classes of gas generators: LOX-rich or\nfuel-rich.

They are used as gas generators\nto start the turbopumps of liquid engines, as accelera-\ntion rockets for stage separation, propellant settling\nof upper stages, or as main or strap-on engines of the\nlaunch vehicle.\n\nThe main advantage of solid propulsion lies in its\nsimple layout based on only a few components: mo-\ntor case, internal thermal protection, solid propellant,\nnozzle and ignition system. The main disadvantage is\nthe low specific impulse. Typical values of 250-295 s\nare about 40% below cryogenic systems. The dry\nmass is also relatively high, since the motor case\nserves as propellant tank and combustion chamber\nconcirrently. Therefore, the case is designed for high\ninternal pressure levels requiring corresponding wall\nthicknesses. The main use of solid propulsion systems\nis therefore the high thrust domain; for example, for\nfirst stages, the high\u2014energy density of solid propel-\nlants allows high mass flow and therefore high thrust\ncombined with relatively small volume. This is often\nmore important than the specific impulse for first\nstages.\n\nPropellant Components and Production\n\nSolid propulsion motors are single-component sys-\ntems; propellant and an oxygen containing chemical\nare mixed together to form a rubber-like block, which\nburns autonomously after ignition. Ariane 5 (see\nFigure 3.3.7) uses ammonium perchlorate (NH,ClO,)\nas oxidizer and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene\n(HTPB) rubber as propellant, with aluminum powder\nto increase gas temperatures and the specific impulse.\nA curing agent is added to promote solidification of\nthe rubber/oxidizer mixture.\n\nPropellant Production\nThe different components of the propellant are\nweighed and mixed in large batches (about 10t of\n\n2/25/09 11:34:50 AM\n",

The mixing process produces a\nhomogeneous semiliquid propellant with honey-like\nviscosity. It is then transferred to a casting pit where it\nis poured into the motor case, which is equipped with\na casting mandrel precisely determining the combus-\ntion channel. The casting process is performed under\nvacuum conditions in order to avoid the formation\nof bubbles in the propellant block. After complete\nloading of the motor case, the polymerization pro-\ncess of the propellant is initiated by increasing the\ntemperature within the casting pit. This curing cycle\nallows the propellant to solidify. After the end of the\ncuring process, as the temperature in the pit decreases\nthe propellant shrinks, allowing the mandrel to be\nextracted.\n\nBurning Types\nThe thrust curve is determined by how the combustion\nsurface develops over time. Burning types are divided\ninto the following categories (see Figure 3.3.8).\n\nNeutral burners are frontal burners (like ciga-\nrettes) with a constant circular combustion surface.\nThey generate constant thrust levels by constant mass\nflows. The hot combustion gases are in contact with\nthe motor case from the beginning of the burn. Con-\nsequently, long burn durations would require excessive\ninternal thermal protection layers and increase weight\nto unacceptable levels. Therefore, frontal burners have\nlimited burn durations and are mostly used for stage\nseparation and propellant settling tasks.\n\nProgressive burners combine frontal burners with\ncylindrical inner channels. The combustion surface\nof the inner channel widens during the burn, which\n\nCHO3.indd 161\n\n161\n\noa\n\nNeutral burner\n\n0 Cc\n\nProgressive burner\n\n6 C.\n\nMixed burner\n\nBU U\n\nChamber pressure\n\nFigure 3.3.8: Burn types of solid propulsion motors.\n\nsteadily increases the generated thrust. This burner\ntype is used mostly for upper stage applications or\nsolid apogee motors.\n\nMixed burners allow an optimum adaptation of\nthe thrust curve to the needs and constraints of the\nselected trajectory. A combination of star-shaped\nburners with cylindrical or conical blocks can provide\nan excellent basis for first stages: the important com-\nbustion surface of the star provides high thrust for\nliftoff; after burnout of the star surface the combustion\nsurface and the resulting thrust decrease. Dynamic\npressure levels, accelerations and gravitation losses\nremain in the predefined limits.

Each of these parameters has its own\nlimits.\n\nHigh pressure levels lead to high dry masses; large\ncombustion surfaces reduce the propellant filling level\nof the motor (= internal volume/propellant volume)\nand increase the dry mass.

This leads to a rather complex\ncomposite gimbal joint design employing accordion-\nlike outer walls.\n\n3.3.3 Engine Components\n\nThe main components of a rocket engine, the gas\ngenerator, the turbopump and the thrust chamber\nassembly with propellant manifolds, injection head,\nignition system, combustion chamber and nozzle, are\nstrongly inter-connected functionally and physically.\n\n3.3.3.1 Injector Head\n\nThe main objectives of the injection head are to\nsupply and homogeneously distribute the propel-\nlants and to decouple the engine and thrust chamber\nsubsystems in order to avoid both mechanical vibra-\ntions and combustion instability. Besides damping\nand homogenizing the secondary flows which result\nfrom the turbomachinery, the pressure losses of\nthe injection elements decouple almost entirely the\npropellant manifolds and the combustion cham-\nber. Typical losses amount to about 15-25% of the\ncombustion chamber pressure. In addition to the\ninjector elements and the propellant manifolds, the\ninjector head typically also includes an appropriate\nignition system.\n\nEngine Start-up and Ignition System\n\nThe engine start-up and ignition system is one of the\nmost critical systems of a rocket engine. Malfunctions\nduring start-up and ignition are among the most\nlikely reasons for launch failures. Hence, the thrust\nchamber, ignition system and start-up sequence have\nto be designed and developed in parallel to ensure safe\nand stable operation.\n\nThe ignition system must provide the necessary\nenergy at the right location and time, long enough to\nignite the propellants injected; an example of a typical\npyrotechnic igniter is shown in Figure 3.3.12.\n\nIn order to ensure this function it has to fulfill\na number of requirements. First, the mixture ratio\nof the propellants has to be near stoichiometric\nand the overall conditions have to be favorable for\nflame spreading at the injectors. Second, the energy\n\nCHO3.indd 163\n\n163\n\nFigure 3.3.12: Pyrotechnic igniter of the Vulcain 1 engine (Source:\nESA).\n\nprovided has to be sufficiently high to ensure pro-\npellant vaporization and heating propellants to\ntemperatures which exceed the ignition temperature.\nPropellant temperatures under 100K make it obvi-\nous why heat transfer is a key element of the engine\nstart-up. An ignition delay of only a few milliseconds\nmay be sufficient to accumulate enough propellants\nwhich, when they react, yield pressure peaks which\ncan be harmful to the combustion chamber or for\nother components of the engine. Additionally, such\npressure peaks can trigger combustion instabilities\nwhich almost always lead to damage of the engine\nand a loss of the entire mission. The arguments\nmentioned above make it clear that an ignition\nsystem strongly depends on the engine start-up and\nthus has to be developed in parallel with the engine\nand matched closely with the injection head and the\nthrust chamber.\n\nInjection Elements\n\nThere are four different principal types of injector\nhead elements, depending on the propellant combi-\nnation and the application: swirl, impinging, show-\nerhead and coaxial injection.\n\nSwirl Injection\n\nIn most cases, the injection element openings for the\noxidizer and the fuel are arranged coaxially to produce\nsignificant tangential injection velocity components\nfor both propellants. Figure 3.3.13 depicts a typical\nexample of such an injection element.\n\n2/24/09 3:18:47 PM\n",

An additional advantage of the swirl injec-\ntion element type utilized in small thrusters is the\ngeneration of a cooling film along the chamber wall\neven without a dedicated film cooling design feature.\nDrawbacks of swirl injection elements are the sensi-\ntivity to manufacturing intolerances and the strong\ninterference with the combustion efficiency and the\nthermal wall loading.\n\nEADS Astrium employs this kind of injection\nelement technology in all small bipropellant thrust-\ners used for satellite positioning and attitude control\nin the thrust range from 10 to 500N. In Russia, swirl\nelements are also utilized for multielement injection\nsystems in high-thrust liquid rocket engines.\n\nImpinging\nImpinging injection is mainly used for propellant\ncombinations with low vaporization rates, for example\nMMHIN,O, in combination with short combustion\nchamber lengths. Propellant mixing is accomplished\nby impinging the different propellant components at\nan angle of about 120\u00b0. The number and geometri-\ncal positioning of the injection holes determine the\ntype of impinging, such as unlike impinging (two\ndifferent propellants mix) and like impinging (the\nsame propellant mixes), as well as doublets, trip-\nlets, quadlets and pentads. Figure 3.3.14 depicts the\ndifferent impinging types.\n\nAs with swirl injection, impinging injection tech-\nnology is also sensitive to manufacturing intolerances\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nDoublet Doublet Triplet Quadlet Pentad\n\\ / \\ / \\ i} / \\ / \\ i] /\n\\ \\V W \\v \\y\n\nFuel \u00b0\n\neo @o o@0 oo ome)\n\u00b0 e\n\no o Oxidizer oo\n\nFigure 3.3.14: Various impinging injection types.\n\nand carries the risk of large and heterogeneous heat\nloads on the combustion chamber wall as well as on\nthe injector faceplate. In addition, impinging injection\ntechnology is also very sensitive in that it can lead to\ncombustion instability.\n\nApplications of the impinging element technology\ncan be found in the rocket engines of the Thor, Atlas,\nSaturn (for the propellant combination LOX/kero-\nsene) and Titan II launchers, and the Moon landing\nengine which utilizes N,O,/UDMH-N,H,.\n\nShowerhead\n\nShowerhead injection is associated with the least\nmanufacturing effort and features the lowest ther-\nmal load conditions of the injector head faceplate\nand combustion chamber wall. The drawback of the\nshowerhead is a nonoptimized mixing process of\nthe propellants and the resulting lower combustion\nefficiency, since the propellants are injected only axi-\nally and the mixing itself depends on the turbulence\noccuring in the combustion chamber.\n\nIn principle, showerhead injection element tech-\nnology consisting of two or several injection holes can\nbe applied to all liquid propellant combinations and\nvarious showerhead configurations.\n\nCoaxial Injection\n\nThe mixing of the propellant components using co-\naxial injection technology is by direct contact of two\ntubular jets of propellant. The high-velocity differen-\ntial of the two jets results in large shear forces imposed\non the two propellants. Besides good mixing behavior,\ncoaxial injection element technology is characterized\nby low functional interference of the injection ele-\nments, good scalability in terms of number of elements\nof the injector head, and low thermal load conditions\nof the injector head faceplate.

Thus,\nthermodynamic effects influence the atomization near\nthe injector head.\n\nDevelopment Logic\n\nThe development logic is driven by the following\nverification methods: analysis, including similarity\nand comparability; testing; inspection; and review\nof design. Verification by testing is certainly the most\nexpensive and was in past years the most preferred\nmethod to demonstrate the reliability of a rocket en-\ngine system. Recent improvements in the numerical\nsimulation of complex physical phenomena present\nin rocket engines are shifting the verification method\nfrom test to analysis. Today\u2019s modeling capability\nincludes the representation of complex combustion\nand flow phenomena, which allows a high level of\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\npredictability of engine behavior. In addition, a large\namount of testing adversely affects the development\ncosts, which is nowadays no longer justifiable. Future\nrocket engine developments will further change the\ndevelopment logic such that a larger extent of the\nverification process will be increasingly performed\nby means of analysis.\n\nRocket engine development programs will always\ndepend on hot fire tests, although the analytical veri-\nfication method will become stronger, as mentioned\nabove. A balance between demonstrated reliabil-\nity level and available development budget must be\nfound. An approach relevant for the development of\nan injector head is depicted in Figure 3.3.17.\n\nHot fire tests are performed on the element level\nusing relevant scale injector head and combustion\nchamber models, keeping the size of the injection ele-\nment unchanged. These test specimens are equipped\nwith a sufficiently large number of thermoelements,\nstatic and dynamic pressure sensors, acceleration\nmeters and strain gauges in order to calibrate the\nsimulation models and consequently improve the\nlevel of predictability. EADS Astrium has used this\napproach for several years with great success, as\ndemonstrated on a cryogenic upper stage expander\nthrust chamber.

The combus-\ntion chamber consists of a relatively short cylindrical\npart, followed by a throat area with a gradually con-\nverging part, the throat section having a contraction\nratio of about 2.5 where the highest thermal loads in\nthe chamber occur. The diverging part of the chamber\ntypically extends down to expansion ratios of 5-8\nand is integrated into the combustion chamber using\nsimilar materials and cooling philosophy. The thrust\nnozzle itself is a separate component often fabricated\nusing a different material as well as a different cooling\ncycle, namely film cooling, dump cooling or radiation\ncooling. The thrust chamber assembly (TCA) sub-\nsystem consists of injection head, ignition system,\ncombustion chamber and nozzle.\n\nCombustion Chamber\n\nThe main objective of the combustion chamber\n(Figure 3.3.18) is to completely burn the propellants\nand to accelerate the exhaust gases to sonic velocities\nin the throat. Design difficulties relate to precise and\nreliable predictions of an optimum liner contour,\ncombustion efficiency, hot gas side and coolant side\nheat transfer and appropriate cooling, required com-\nponent lifetime and, finally, reliable and justifiable\nrequirements for and interface conditions between\nthe TCA components.\n\nCooling of Combustion Chamber and Nozzle\n\nThe key challenge of the entire combustion cham-\nber and nozzle design process is to predict cooling\nsystem behavior and performance. A collection of\ndifferent cooling processes and possibilities is shown\n\nCHO3.indd 167\n\n167\n\nFigure 3.3.18: Combustion chamber of Vulcain 2 (Source:\nASTRIUM).\n\nin Figure 3.3.19, using for illustration a combustion\nchamber wall cross-section including a cooling chan-\nnel and pertinent heat transfer mechanisms.\n\nThe standard cooling method in rocket engines\nis regenerative cooling. One propellant, typically the\nfuel, enters through a distribution manifold at the\ncombustion chamber end and is directed in a coun-\nterflow direction upstream through cooling channels\nto the injector head and thus enters the combustion\nchamber through appropriately designed injectors.\nBoth the hot gas side as well as the coolant side heat\ntransfer, which define the overall thermal loads and\nthe cooling channel pressure loss, are extremely de-\npendent on the cooling channel design.

However, such a\ncoupled solution based on numerical results is not to\nbe expected in the near future. The reasons are both\nnumerous and serious: the differences in length scales\nof the combustion chamber, injector element and\nboundary layer; the time scales of nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics; finite rate chemistry; the presence\n\nFigure 3.3.20: Copper liner with milled cooling channels (Source:\nASTRIUM).\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nFigure 3.3.21: Combustion chamber liner cross section (Source:\nASTRIUM).\n\nof areas with subsonic, transonic and supersonic ve-\nlocities; atomization in general and atomization under\nsubcritical, transcritical and supercritical conditions\nin particular; and last but not least, the necessity for\ncomplex thermodynamic descriptions of processes, for\nexample the properties and behavior of gases, liquids\nand solids under cryogenic conditions. Furthermore,\ndissociation of the exhaust gases has a direct impact on\nthe combustion efficiency but may also cause a local\ntemperature increase in the cooler boundary layer due\nto recombination. Finally, catalytic reactions at the sur-\nface may additionally influence the local heat balance\nand thus have an impact on the overall heat transfer. In\nthe case of hydrocarbon fuels, decomposition reactions\ndue to pyrolysis in the cooling channels may further\nincrease the complexity of the coupled problem.\n\nWith all that said, it is rather obvious that semi- or\nfully empirical correlations in the form of Nusselt rela-\ntions are used; a typical example is the Bartz equation,\nwhich describes the hot gas side heat transfer:\n\nNu = 0.062 Re\u00ae P73 (3.3.8)\n\n(107 < Re< 108, Pr=0.5)\n\nVarious modifications of this basic relation exist,\ngenerated by engineers trying to make use of known\nor measured local geometrical quantities or thermo-\ndynamic and fluid properties which have an influence\non the local heat transfer in order either to improve\nthe predictive capabilities of the relation for a given set\nof operating conditions, or to enlarge the parameter\nrange of application:\n\n2/24/09 3:18:51 PM\n",

Regenerative cooling applying tubes\nor milled cooling channels reaches its limits at heat\nflux densities of about 30 MW/m\u201d and 80 MW/m?,\nrespectively. At higher heat flux levels it is usually\nassisted by film cooling, examples being the Vulcain 2,\nSSME or the RD-180 engines.

The functional\nprinciple is based on the interaction of the following\nphenomena: heat input from the hot gas flow leads\nto melting and vaporization of the wall material and\nestablishes together with an endothermic reaction a\nnear-wall coolant film. Materials used are carbon, C/C\nor SiC structures without infiltrated hydrocarbons.\nThose hydrocarbons may also have favorable additives\nincorporated, such as tungsten (W) or rhenium (Re).\nThe disadvantage of the method lies in its limitation\nof the burn time and operating regime of the engine.\nQuite often ablative cooled systems additionally apply\nfilm cooling in the injection area in order to reduce\ninjector/wall interaction and reduce the heat flux in\ngeneral. As an example, both the Viking and the RS-68\nengines have ablative cooled nozzle throats. Common\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\ncharacteristics of both engines are short burn times\nand comparatively low chamber pressures of 205 and\n250s, and 59 and 97 bar, respectively. Any design is\nentirely dependent on the materials and additives ap-\nplied and the operating conditions of the combustor.\nA specific mathematical relation is omitted here. The\nonly thing to be mentioned is that the applied design\nlogic can be based on that of a solid booster; however,\ndetailed parameters representing the specific charac-\nteristics of the materials used have to be determined\nexperimentally.\n\nRadiation Cooling\n\nAside from the conventional closed cooling cycles\napplied in combustion chambers, thrust nozzles are\ncooled either in an open cycle mode called \u201cdump\ncooling\u201d or by radiation cooling. Obviously, this\nmethod relies on materials withstanding high tem-\nperatures and thus is only applicable for satellite\nengines; however, it is often used for the extensions of\nthrust nozzles. Independent of the material applied,\nbe it refractory metals such as tungsten, rhenium or\niridium, or ceramic matrix composites, the surface\nof thrusters working within the atmosphere has to\nbe covered with an oxygen protective layer. Upper\nstage engines such as the RL10-B or the new Vinci\nusually use a ceramic matrix composite (CMC) nozzle\nextension. The design of a radiation-cooled device fol-\nlows Equation 3.3.17 with the emission coefficient \u20ac,\nthe Stefan\u2014Boltzmann radiation constant 6 and the\nmaximum wall temperature T,,,:\n\nq=eoT! (3.3.17)\n\nwg\nIt is worth mentioning that radiation-cooled thrusters\nor nozzles require a shielding system which protects\nsensitive engine parts and measurement equipment\n\nfrom high heat loads.\n\nNozzle Extension\n\nThe main function of the nozzle extension is to\noptimally expand the hot combustion gases and to\nmaximize the exhaust velocity to create maximum\nthrust (see Equation 3.3.1). Bell-shaped nozzles with\na parabolic contour (see Figure 3.3.22) generate an\nexhaust flow of high axial parallelism at minimal\nlosses.\n\n2/24/09 3:18:54 PM\n",
    "192": "3.3. Propulsion Systems\n\nIn general two kinds of contours can be distin-\n\nguished:\n\n1. Classical ideal nozzles, with contours similar to\nwind tunnel nozzles and lengths adapted to the\nambient pressure.\n\n2. Thrust-optimized nozzles, their contours opening\nat somewhat steeper angles behind the throat, thus\nleading to shorter length and less mass at the same\nexpansion ratio.\n\nThrust-optimized contours are more sensitive to\nside loads during operational transients because of\ntheir internal specific fluid conditions and therefore\nnecessitate more robust structures compared to ideal\nnozzles.\nOne of the basic problems of booster engine\nnozzles results from their long burning time. The exit\npressure of the nozzle on the ground (during start) is\nsmaller than the ambient pressure (overexpansion),\nand therefore the thrust is lower than optimal. If the\nexpansion ratio exceeds a certain limit, flow separation\noccurs in the nozzle extension, creating destructive\nside loads. During the ascent the ambient pressure\ndecreases steadily until the optimum thrust is reached\nwhen ambient and exit pressures are identical. During\nfurther ascent the ambient pressure continuously\ndecreases below the exit pressure (underexpansion)\nand deviation from the optimum thrust increases. The\nlosses at the start and end of the burn time can reach\n10 to 15%, as Figure 3.3.23 shows.\n\nThe design of the nozzle is therefore always a com-\npromise between safety during ground operation and\nachievable specific impulse at altitude.

Engines\nwith short burning times associated with low to\nonly moderate heat fluxes allow simple steel design\nchambers which are either specially coated and film\ncooled, or contain ablative inserts which slowly burn\naway and in the process cool the chamber. The thrust\nchamber of the Viking engine is often quoted as a\ntypical example of such a design. Higher chamber\npressures, more energetic propellant combinations\nand longer burning times require the above-described\nregenerative cooling and accordingly a much more\ncomplex design. The design of such combustion\nchambers is usually characterized by two different\nfunctions realized in two main parts:\n\n1.

The load-\ncarrying nickel structure is subsequently deposited by\na galvanic process. After finalization of the galvanic\ndeposition the wax is expelled from the cooling chan-\nnels by moderate heating. Inlet and outlet manifolds\nfor the coolant are joined to the jacket by EB (Electron\nBeam) welding. This manufacturing technology was\ndeveloped and patented by MBB, the predecessor of\ntoday\u2019s EADS Astrium Space Transportation, in the\n1960s. The combustion chambers of the SSME and\nalso of Vulcain 1 and Vulcain 2 are built using the\nmethod described above.\n\nAs an alternative the electro-deposited jacket\nstructure can also be brazed to the combustion cham-\nber liner. This technology is widely used, especially\nin Russian engines. But also the relatively new RS-68\nengine features a combustion chamber built using\nbrazing technology.\n\n3.3.3.3 Gas Generators\n\nThe main purpose of a gas generator or, in the case\nof a staged combustion cycle, the engine preburner\nis to provide the necessary hot gases to drive the\nturbopump. The power requirement of the turbine\ndepends on the mass flow rate and the thermodynamic\nproperties (> k, T,) of the driver gas, on the turbine\nefficiency and on the available pressure ratio p,/p,:\n\nk-1\nP=niitey Ty |1- (af (3.3.18)\n1\n\nWhile the turbine exit pressure p, of bypass or\ngas generator cycle engines is not directly coupled\nto the pressure in the combustion chamber, typical\nvalues are in the order of a few bars; this pressure for\nstaged combustion cycle engines has to exceed the\nchamber pressure by far, quite often by 2-3 times\n(see Table 3.3.8). The already extreme mechanical\nand dynamic loads require moderate turbine entry\ntemperatures which should not exceed 900 K.

All except the Russian RD-\n180, which operates with LOX/kerosene, are H,/O,-\nfired engines, and while the European (Vulcain 2) is\na gas generator cycle engine, the American (SSME),\nJapanese (LE-7) and Russian (RD-0120) engines are\nall based on the stage combustion cycle mode. While\nall the engines mentioned in Table 3.3.8 have a gas\ngenerator and turbine for each propellant, the Russian\nRD-0120 and RD-180 have only a single gas genera-\ntor and turbine which drives both propellant pumps.\nAll H,/O, engines shown in Table 3.3.8 operate their\ngas generators in fuel-rich mode, independent of the\nengine cycle. By contrast, the RD-180, as in all Russian\nLOX/kerosene engines, operates in an oxygen-rich\nmode which is the outcome of a system-driven opti-\nmization of the engine. An analysis of equation 3.3.18\nreveals that in fuel-rich H,/O, systems, the smaller\nmolecular mass of the driver gas results in a higher\nspecific capacity c,, which more than compensates\nfor the disadvantage of the smaller mass flow rate ri\nHowever, due to the comparatively large molecular\nmass of kerosene, gas generators which operate with\nLOX/kerosene in oxygen-rich operating mode yield\nsmaller molecular masses of the driver gas. This has\ntwo advantages: high specific heat capacity \u00a2, and\nmuch higher turbine mass flow rates. Additionally,\noxygen-rich preburner operation apparently avoids\nthe problem of soot formation and its successive de-\nposition in the turbine or injection system.\n\nThe propellant injectors used in fuel-rich gas gene-\nrators are often similar to those applied in the main\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nchamber since the propellant temperatures are only\nslightly different. In order to establish stable combus-\ntion conditions in the case of oxygen-rich injection\nwhere the overall mixture ratio exceeds 50, a two-zone\ncombustion process is realized. The first part of the\noxygen is injected in the primary combustion zone\nto achieve gas temperatures of about 2000 K and the\nremainder of the oxygen is injected further down-\nstream. Thus a homogeneous temperature profile is\nachieved at the entrance to the turbine. The problem\nof material compatibility of gas generator, fluid sup-\nply and turbine with hot, oxidizer-rich gases can be\novercome by either surface passivation or appropriate\ncoatings.\n\n3.3.3.4 Turbomachinery\n\nLiquid rocket engines can be differentiated into\npressure-fed and pump-fed engines with respect\nto their propellant feed system. The tank mass of\npressure-fed engines limits the chamber pressure.\nPumps make high chamber pressures above 200 bar\npossible at moderate tank pressures (3-8 bar). The\nhigh chamber pressures required for lower stages\nnecessitate pump-fed engines in order to limit the\nengine mass (and size) for large thrusts.\n\nWhen designing engines with turbopumps it\nmust be assured that the pressure at the pump inlet\nis above a minimum to avoid cavitation. The pumps,\nusually driven by one or more turbines, feed the\npropellants at the required flow rates and mixture\nratios from the tanks via feed lines, valves, cooling\nchannels and injection elements into the combustion\nchamber. The operational conditions are controlled\nby regulation devices.\n\nTurbopump Components\n\nThe LOX pump of the Vulcain 2 engine is shown in\nFigure 3.3.28. The main components and systems\nof a turbopump power head are pump and turbine,\ngas generator or preburner, bearings, seals, gearbox,\ninlet and outlet manifolds, and lines. Only the most\nimportant components of turbopumps are described\nbelow. Detailed information on lubrication, bearings,\nseals and axial balancing systems can be found in the\nrelevant literature. A turbopump consists of a single\nor multistage pump driven by a single or multistage\nturbine, according to the requirements. With few\n\n2/24/09 3:18:58 PM\n",

Mostly axial turbines are used for\nthe same reasons. With this approach tens of mega-\nwatts can be realized in compact turbopumps.\n\nDifferent turbopump configurations are shown in\nFigure 3.3.29. The most compact type is the single-\nshaft turbopump. However, this concept requires\na compromise concerning pump speed, which is\nidentical for both pumps. To counteract this disad-\nvantage the pump speed is adjusted by a gearbox. In\na dual-shaft configuration the optimum speed and\nperformance can be adapted individually for each\npropellant. A huge challenge for the design and con-\nstruction of a turbopump is, besides controlling the\nrotor dynamics, the control of the high temperature\ngradient.

    "198": "3.3. Propulsion Systems\n\nmain axial turbine types are impulse turbines and\nreaction turbines.\n\nImpulse Turbine\n\nIn the impulse turbine the working gas is expanded in\nthe stator and accelerated to high velocity. The acting\nmomentum causes rotation of the rotor. The cross-\nsection between the blades is constant and the gas\nflow is merely redirected. In the idealized friction-free\ncase the gas is not accelerated, the pressure remains\nconstant and the reaction degree is zero. The reaction\ndegree characterizes the pressure drop in the rotor as\na fraction of the pressure drop in the whole stage (sta-\ntor plus rotor). The impulse turbine is used mainly in\ngas generator cycle engines with high pressure ratios\nand low flow rates; it exists in two design variants:\nvelocity-compounded or pressure-compounded. In\nthe first variant the gas is expanded only in the first\nstator; the flow is redirected only in the following ro-\ntor and subsequent stages. In the second variant the\ngas is expanded in the stator and is redirected in the\nrotor of every stage.\n\nReaction Turbine\n\nIn this turbine type the expansion is distributed bet-\nween the stator and rotor. The cross-section between\nthe blades diverges, causing an expansion. At a reaction\ndegree of 100% the mechanical energy comes solely\nfrom the gas expansion in the rotor. Theoretically, any\n\n100\n\n177\n\nreaction degree can be designed, but mostly a design\nfor a 50% reaction is used. The reaction turbine is\nused mostly in staged combustion engines to reduce\nthe pressure ratio between the pump discharge and\nmain combustion chamber.\n\nTurbine Characteristics\n\nThe turbine efficiency is a function of the number of\nstages and the velocity ratio u/c), where u is the mean\npitch line speed and q is the isentropic pouting veloc-\nity, which is expressed for n stages as\n\n(3.3.19)\n\nFurthermore, the turbine efficiency depends on\nthe type, whether reaction or impulse turbine.\nFigure 3.3.32 shows typical design points for a single-\nstage turbine. The curve does not consider losses\ncaused by the gap between blades and the housing\n(tip clearance).\n\nTo account for tip clearance the values from the\ndiagram have to be reduced to about 90-95%. As\ngiven by the characteristics, the efficiency increases\nwith increasing velocity ratio u/c).

Internal loads\nare the chamber pressure, the resulting thrust and\nthe thermal loads along the hot gas wall and in the\ncooling channels. For example, temperatures from 20\nto about 3800 K are reached during operation of the\nengine. Mechanical loads (aside from thrust loads) are\ninduced by the inertial forces during gimbaling of the\nengine for thrust vector control and by transient side\nloads during engine ramp-up.\n\nExternal loads are mainly pressure pulsations in\nthe engine\u2019s ambient atmosphere, called buffeting,\nas well as the heating of the engine\u2019s outer surface by\nradiation from the solid booster flames.\n\nThese extreme thermal and mechanical loads can\nlead to two basically different kinds of failure: failure\nby fatigue and failure by rupture.\n\nRepeated cyclic loadings, which are differentiated\naccording to their frequency of occurrence into LCF\n(Low Cycle Fatigue) and HCF (High Cycle Fatigue)\ncontribute to the fatigue, which is aggravated by the\ncreep of the material under plastic strain over long\n\n600 800 1000 1200\nTemperature [K]\n\noperating periods (creep damage). The remaining free\noxygen radicals generated by incomplete combustion\ndegrade the life of the hot chamber wall further by\noxidation (blanching).\n\nThe combustion chamber inner wall is the most\nstressed component of a thrust chamber and has the\nlowest expected lifetime. The accumulated damage\nis dominated by fatigue. The extreme temperature\ngradients between hot gas wall and cooling channel\nfloor result in high plastic strains which ultimately\nlead to the so-called dog house effect during cyclic\noperations, that is the rupture of a cooling channel\n(see Figure 3.3.34).\n\n\u2018crack\nDog house damage ff\n\nNickel doseout wall\n\nFigure 3.3.34: Dog house effect (Source: ASTRIUM).\n\n2/24/09 3:19:03 PM\n",
    "200": "3.3. Propulsion Systems\n\nOnce opened, the crack is drastically cooled by the\nleaking coolant, which suppresses crack propagation.\nThe risk of malfunction during operation is reduced\nby this effect, but is very high in the case of engine\nreignition.\n\nA classic example for sudden overstraining is\nthe occurrence of side loads during engine ramp-\nup. These side loads result from asymmetrical flow\nseparation in the nozzle extension before the nozzle\nis fully flowing. These loads can reach up to 10% of\nthe nominal thrust of the engine.\n\nOscillations in Propulsion Systems\n\nAs a consequence of its high energy density combined\nwith small internal losses, the propulsion system\nof a launcher stage is a nearly undamped system.\nTherefore, special care has to be taken during the\ndevelopment process to design propulsion systems\nwhich avoid oscillations.\n\nOscillations occur either if there are interactions\nbetween the propellant tanks and the rocket engine,\nor if pressure oscillations are induced in the engine\nitself. The occurrence of such phenomena can lead to\nthe loss of stages and consequently to the loss of the\nentire mission.\n\nThree main types of oscillations can be distin-\nguished, as follows.\n\nPOGO Oscillations\n\nOscillations induced by resonances between the\nengine, the structure of the stage and the propellants\nstored in the stage tanks are called POGO oscillations.\nDepending on the stage size, the frequency of POGO\noscillations is between 80 and 100 Hz. POGO oscilla-\ntions can be avoided by so-called anti-POGO devices\nbuilt into in the feed lines between the tanks and the\nengine and acting as damping components.\n\nHydraulic Oscillations in the Propulsion System\nThis phenomenon is a low-frequency oscillation\nbetween the lines of the propellant feed system and\nthe engine and is known as chugging. Frequencies are\nbetween 100 and 800 Hz.\n\nIt was pointed out in Section 3.3.3.1 (Injector\nHead) that a coupling between the liquid side of\nthe feed system and the gas side of the combustion\nchamber can be avoided by designing a maximum\n\nCHO3.indd 179\n\n179\n\npossible injection pressure loss. Pressure-fed propul-\nsion systems are much more vulnerable to chugging\nthan are pump-fed systems because the turbopump\nalready guarantees a high degree of decoupling.\n\nOscillations in the Combustion Chambers\nBesides low-frequency oscillations, high-frequency\noscillations are also triggered within the liquid pro-\npellant engine\u2019s combustion process. The triggering\nis induced by the coupling of the chemical reaction\nprocess with the eigenfrequency of the combustion\nvolume. Resonances can occur within these oscilla-\ntions in preferred frequency bands, which may lead to\nan unstable combustion process, called combustion\ninstability. It results in oscillations with a very high\nenergy content which may lead to the demolition of\nthe combustion chamber. This dynamic combustion\nbehavior has been the subject of intensive research for\nmany years in an attempt to find an accurate mathe-\nmatical formulation supported by comprehensive\nexperimental investigations.\nSuch phenomena occur not only during the steady-\nstate operational phase, but also during the transients\nwhile the engine is being ramped up or down. The\nassociated sudden high-pressure fluctuations induce\nhigh accelerations and lead to the disintegration of\nthe combustion jet boundary layer, which results\nin a prompt steep increase of the heat flux to the\ncombustion chamber wall. High mechanical loads\nin combination with increased heat transfer to the\n\nchamber wall can cause the wall cooling system to fail\nin milliseconds, demolishing the engine because of\nthe melting of the chamber wall and usually leading\nto loss of the mission as a consequence.\n\nOne of the most important issues during develop-\nment of an engine is experimental proof of a stable\ncombustion process. To increase operational reliabil-\nity, damping devices such as acoustic cavities or sym-\nmetrically arranged baffles are additionally used.\n\nIn the Ariane program every engine used under-\ngoes a hot acceptance test after its production to prove\nits dynamic stability.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the likelihood of\ncombustion instability increases with the diameter\nof the combustion chamber.\n\n2/24/09 3:19:05 PM\n",

The DLR-owned\nresearch and development facilities for small and sub-\nscale and component testing, namely the test stands\nP1, P2, P6 and P8, are located next to the ESA-owned\nfacilities for full-scale components and engine tests.\nFigure 3.3.35 presents a bird\u2019s eye view of the testing\nsite with the test facilities P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P8 and\nsome of the storage areas for propellants and cooling\nwater. The P1 test complex has facilities for vacuum\nsimulation tests of satellite propulsion systems and\napogee engines and the P2 complex is a test facility for\nsea-level tests of storable systems of less than 20KN.\nThe P3 stand is a full-scale thrust chamber test bench\nfor cryogenic propellants with thrust range up to\n2000 KN. The high-altitude simulation facility P4 for\nupper stage engines offers two test positions, one for\nstorable and the other for cryogenic propellants.

Such a development and testing methodo-\nlogy requires various large-scale facilities, which are a\nmajor cost factor. But the risk of a simple component\nfailure occurring during a test, which damages major\nparts of a facility vital for engine development, thus\nendangering the program as a whole, is considered too\nhigh for other, less decentralized solutions.\n\nSystem test facilities are characterized according\nto the engine types tested in sea-level and altitude\nsimulation facilities. Booster and main stage engines\nare tested under sea-level conditions, upper stages,\napogee and satellite engines under high-altitude con-\nditions. Characteristic features of altitude simulation\ntest benches are systems and installations which es-\ntablish and maintain vacuum-like conditions during\nengine firing.\n\nThere is a general rule: fly as you test and test as\nyou fly, and no component, subsystem or engine ever\nflies before it has been demonstrated that it fulfills all\nthe requirements and operates within the safety mar-\ngins. However, it is not always possible to realize this\nprinciple totally. For example, the ambient pressure\nduring ascent decreases continuously, thus changing\nthe thrust as well as the pressure difference across the\nthrust nozzle. It is extremely costly to modify a test\nbench for large rocket engines to simulate this ascent,\nand therefore such tests are often omitted.

Even assuming that a\nsignificant technology step could be taken toward the\ndevelopment of very light materials with high thermal\nresistance and low thermal expansion coefficients, it\nwould only result in a marginal performance increase.\nIn looking for concrete improvement options, the\nfollowing steps seem reasonable:\ne Improvement of cooling methods, to result in\nlower pressure losses.\ne Increase of turbine inlet temperatures and rota-\ntional speed.\n\ne Management of material compatibility for prebur-\nners operating at high mixture ratios.\n\nAs described in Section 3.3.3.2, the next logical\nstep in increasing launcher performance is to find\nengineering solutions for nozzles capable of adapting\nto ambient pressure during ascent.\n\nFrom the very beginning of commercial space\nflight, analytical as well as experimental investigations\nhave been performed on the subscale level with the\ngoal of using oxygen from the surrounding air during\nthe flight through the atmosphere in order to increase\nthe specific impulse and thereby substantially decrease\nthe take-off mass of space vehicles. Recent investiga-\ntions by NASA have concluded that a substantial\nbenefit from such systems would only be visible if\n\n2/24/09 3:19:14 PM\n",

Above all, launch complexes have\nto be operated without risks for people and goods.\nIt is therefore important that the launch site provides\nsufficient free space around hazardous areas. The\nlaunch trajectories must be outside of populated areas\nand a broad range of orbits should be economically\nreachable. Therefore, launch sites near the equator\noffer clear advantages for geostationary orbits, as\nnearly no correctional maneuvers are needed for\ninclination changes and the extra energy provided by\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation can be fully exploited. The topo-\nlogy of the launch site should allow the construction\nof the required infrastructure. Nearby hills help, for\nexample, to achieve the optimal positioning of anten-\nnas needed to receive the telemetry stream emitted\nfrom the launch vehicle or for tracking the launcher\nduring its ascent.\n\nThe available infrastructure around the launch site\nshould allow affordable transport of the launch vehicle\nelements, the payloads, the launch teams, the propel-\nlants, and all other types of ground support from the\nvarious production sites to the launch site.\n\nThe climate at the site should allow regular\nlaunches. Sites with limited and predictable prob-\nability of thunderstorms or high-altitude shear winds\nhold the promise of high availability rates. The risks\nof tornados at the launch site should be minimal, and\nthe site should preferably not be located in a region\nwith earthquake risk.\n\nLaunch complexes require substantial budgets to\nfinance construction and maintenance. Predictable\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\neconomic and political stability of the region around\n\nthe launch site helps to secure the required finance.\nThe infrastructure ofa launch site makes possible\n\nthe following tasks:\n\ne Arrival, unloading and transport of the launch\nvehicle elements, the payloads and all other equip-\nment and materials not produced in situ.\n\ne Assembly and test of the launch vehicle and the\npayloads.\n\ne Loading of the launch vehicle and the payloads\nwith propellants and gases and providing charge\ncapabilities for the on-board batteries.\n\ne Assembly of the payloads on the launch vehicle.\n\ne Transport of the assembled launch vehicle inclu-\nding the payloads to the launch pad.\n\ne Accessibility for the last preparatory activities\nbefore the launch, such as cryogenic propellant\nfueling or switching on the on-board systems.\n\n3.4.2 Concepts\n\nThe design of a launch complex has to take various\ncriteria into account. Commercial launch sites often\nprepare several payloads and launch vehicles in paral-\nlel. This requires adequate coordination: delays either\nof the launcher or of payloads should have minimum\ncollateral impact. The consequences of a launch fail-\nure should remain predictable and the repair costs\nof and recovery schedules from damage should be\nmanageable. The maximum allowable preparation\ncycles for launchers and payloads must be defined to\naccommodate the specified launch rates.\n\nIn the last 50 years the following concepts for\nlaunch complexes have been realized.\n\nThe \u201call-in-one\u201d concept: Launch vehicle assem-\nbly, test and launch preparation are performed directly\non the launch pad on the launch table. This allows\nminimized budgets and lead times for construction\nof the ground infrastructure, but launch rates are\nalso limited (a typical value is five launches per year).\nAlternative processing options in case of delays do not\nexist, and in case of a launch failure in the early ascent\nphase, there is a very high risk that the overall launch\npreparation infrastructure will be damaged.\n\n2/24/09 3:19:16 PM\n",
    "206": "3.4 Launch Infrastructure\n\nThis concept was applied mostly in the 1950s to\n970s, in Europe for the Ariane versions 1 to 3, for\nexample. The application of the all-in-one concept is\ntoday limited mostly to small launch vehicles. The next\nlogical evolutionary step was the physical separation\nbetween launch vehicle preparation and launch activi-\nties; the disadvantages of the all-in-one concept led\nin the 1960s and 1970s to concepts where the launch\npad is used only for activities relevant for the launch\nproper. Launch vehicle and payload assembly and\ntests are performed in separate buildings before the\nauncher is transferred to the pad. This concept was\napplied in the USA for Saturn V and the Space Shuttle,\nand in Europe for Ariane 4.\n\nThe \u201cclean pad\u201d concept (applied from the 1990s\nonwards, e.g., for Ariane 5) aims at minimizing the\namount of infrastructure needed on the launch pad.\nAn important part of the infrastructure is incorpo-\nrated directly in the launch table and only the absolute\nminimum of infrastructure remains on the pad. But\nthis concept also has one major disadvantage: even\nminor anomalies on the launch vehicle may require a\ntransfer back from the pad to the assembly building, as\nthe clean pad concept does not in many cases provide\nappropriate access for repairs.\n\n3.4.3 One Realized Example: Ariane 5\n\nThis section describes the infrastructure required for\nan Ariane 5 launch.\n\nPayload preparation is performed in clean rooms\n(see Figure 3.4.1) equipped with mechanical and\nelectrical equipment. After the (in general, aerial)\ntransport from the manufacturer to the launch site,\nthe payload is unloaded and connected to its specific\nground support equipment, allowing the testing of\nall electrical and mechanical functions of the subsys-\ntems. After final leak checks and functional controls,\nthe propellant tanks of the spacecraft are filled and\nhigh-pressure vessels are pressurized with helium or\nnitrogen. The customer teams themselves carry out\nthis test and preparation phase, with the launch pro-\nvider giving logistical support (e.g., means of trans-\nport, climate control equipment, electrical supply,\nworkshops, offices, etc.). At the end of this preparatory\n\nCHO3.indd 185\n\n185\n\nFigure 3.4.1: Payload preparation (Source: ESA).\n\nphase the payload is weighed to make sure that the\nallowable mass budgets are met. Then the payload is\nhanded over to the launch provider for integration\non the launch vehicle. The overall preparation cycles\nfor payloads vary from four to eight weeks and might\neven be longer for science payloads.\n\nThe preparation of the launch vehicle starts in the\nvehicle assembly building. The different stages of the\nlauncher are extracted from their transport contai-\nners, erected with the help of a crane, assembled, and\nconnected to the fluid and electrical ground support\nequipment. The assembly of the launch vehicle is fol-\nlowed by an intense test phase, including leak checks\nof all fluid systems and engines and the functional\ntesting of all systems.\n\nFor a heavy launcher of the Ariane 5 class this part\nof the launch campaign requires about 20 working\ndays.\n\nAfter the end of the integration and test phase the\nlauncher and the launch table are transferred to the\nfinal assembly building, as shown in Figure 3.4.2.\n\nPayload integration on the launcher: The launch-\ner and payloads remain in the final assembly building\nfor about eight days. The following working steps are\nperformed in this building:\n\ne Assembly of the lower payload including its pay-\nload adapter directly on the launcher.\n\ne Off-line assembly in a separate preparation work-\nshop of the upper payload, the launch vehicle car-\nrying structures and the launcher fairing.\n\n2/24/09 3:19:16 PM\n",

Generally the most important param-\n\neters are:\n\ne System reliability\n\ne Payload capacity and accuracy for target orbits/\nmissions\n\n2/24/09 3:20:31 PM\n",
    "211": "CHO3.indd 190\n\n190\n\ne Budget restraints for the development phase\n\ne Costs for production and operation\n\ne Date of the first flight (maiden flight), launch\nsequence and required production rate.\n\nOften, the development of launch systems follows\nthe principles of total quality management (TQM),\nmeaning that system reliability and robustness are of\nmain concern, and thus the design drivers. However,\nif other parameters are considered to be of equal im-\nportance, the development approach is called design\nto value, or design to cost in the particular case when\ndevelopment costs are faced with production and\noperating costs during an optimization process.\n\nIn addition, launch vehicle development programs\nfor civil applications are often combined with other\nprogrammatic aspects such as:\n\ne Toenable the participation of companies according\n\nto predefined shares among different countries (so-\n\ncalled GEO return within the ESA perimeter).\n\ne Touse explicitly new technologies which have been\n\nfunded beforehand, such as propulsion technolo-\n\ngies, materials, or other specific stage subsystems.\n\ne To ensure the system\u2019s availability at a given time;\n\nfor example, to put a planned satellite system into\n\norbit on time.\n\ne To use a certain launch site.\n\ne Touse already available components or technolo-\n\ngical heritage (from past projects).\n\ne Torespect general applicable standards (e.g. debris\navoidance).\n\nThe main customer for civil launch vehicle develop-\nment in Europe is ESA, assisted by the French Space\nAgency CNES. ESA/CNES provide the technical re-\nquirements via a functional requirements speci-\nfication (FS, cf. ECSS-E-10 Part 6A, in the Ariane\ncontext called CdCF (Cahier de Charge Fonctionnel)).\nThe launch vehicle developer is in charge of formally\nresponding to the functional specification by imple-\nmentation of a technical specification (TS) which\ndescribes in detail the desired performance and the\nfunctional breakdown of the intended product de-\nrived from the given main functions. The functional\ndescription, usually set up as a tree of functions, is\nthe basis for later elaborating the technical solution,\ndetailed design and systematic verification approach\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nfor each required and specified function from the\nhighest to the lowest system level; see Figure 3.5.1\nfor an example of a function tree. Drawing up a\nfunctional analysis loop makes it possible to analyze\nall functions for the entire life cycle of the product.\nIt is essential to identify all relevant loads, interfaces,\nand interactions.\n\nIna second step, the identified loads, the specific\nrequirements and interface conditions are quantified\nand in turn laid down in the technical specifications,\nin general dimensioning loads, or in interface control\ndocuments (ICDs).\n\nThe appropriately detailed quantification of all\nrequirements and loads on the system and main\nsubsystem levels is the key challenge in the early phase\nof the launch vehicle development project, besides\nthe elaboration of design and operational trade off\nstudies. During launcher development, this process\nhas a strongly vertical dimension: the loads and re-\nquirements are detailed from the launch vehicle level\nto the stage level and down to the subsystem level.\nAccording to the so called V-Model, the follow-up\nprocess at each level consists of: requirements defini-\ntion, design and dimensioning, manufacturing, test\nand verification. Toward the end of the development\nprocess, starting with the lowest subsystem level\nelement and then moving up to each next higher\nlevel, the integrity and functional performance of\nthe product has to be proven by verification to the\ntechnical specification. The necessary process and\ntasks for this qualification process are the main focus\nof this chapter.\n\nSystem engineering plays a central role in the\nlaunch vehicle development process, since it is\nresponsible both for system definition and for orga-\nnizing the means of verification as an integral part of\nthe overall qualification process, commencing with\nthe concept phase.\n\nThe role of system engineering is manifold: be-\nsides the management of the margins projectwide,\nanother main task is the elaboration of the core prod-\nuct development documentation, consisting of (the\ndesignations used in the Ariane program are given in\nbrackets for reference):\n\ne Specification of system performance (ST, Techni-\ncal Specification)\n\n2/24/09 3:20:32 PM\n",

The realistic characterization of the product\nunder the given loads (environmental, induced and\noperational) is the most challenging effort during the\nlater qualification process due to the large variation\nand superposition of combined loads.\n\nTechnical Qualification of the Launch Vehicle\nThe qualification approach is different for the various\ntechnical disciplines. For example, for the design of\n\nCHO3.indd 191\n\nthe mechanical systems, narrow margins of safety are\nused to achieve low structural mass in order to allow\na high payload lift-up capacity while complying with\nthe required reliability standard. Therefore, starting\nwith the processing of the raw materials, all produc-\ntion steps have to provide certified and constant\nmechanical parameters subject to comprehensive\ncharacterization tests. Particular attention is paid to\nthe assessment of fatigue failures and the prediction\nof crack propagation. To this end, load cycles and\ndynamic load assumptions are defined conservatively.\nIn contrast, thermal engineering applies a different\napproach for the thermal analysis and qualification\nof the thermal design. Usually the worst case is as-\nsumed, where the most unfavorable combination of\nthermal system conditions must not endanger any of\nthe functions and operations.\n\nOften during the design and analysis phase the\nassessment and calculation cycles have to be repeated\niteratively in order to consider changes in the de-\nsign, operations or loads. Only robust and continu-\nous management of margins and risks enables the\nconvergence of design and requirement on the one\nhand, and the optimization of performance versus\ndevelopment costs on the other hand. For instance,\nincreasing system mass might be balanced by margins\nin the velocity increment of the first stage, or by the\nspecific impulse of the upper stage.\n\n2/24/09 3:20:32 PM\n",

This mainly comprises the proof\nthat the required performance is delivered under\nrealistic environmental and operational conditions,\nthat all requirements are fulfilled, that there are no\nunexpected deviations in the product hardware and\nsoftware, and that the ground segment launch of\noperations have been formally approved.\n\nMost of the verification measures are already\nimplemented by consequent and comprehensive ap-\nplication of a formally qualified development process\n(e.g., analysis of all requirements for the complete\nlife cycle, analysis of loads, etc., up to the proving\nmethods). Typical verification methods for launch\nsystems are numerical analysis and simulation, experi-\nmental demonstration, analogy, inspection, and test\nor qualification flight. Usually a combination of these\nmethods is applied. In particular, analyses and tests\nare performed stepwise and complementarily on all\nproduct levels during the development process. Simu-\nlation and analysis models have to be validated. Criti-\ncal assumptions and hypotheses have to be proven by\nexperiments/tests or statistical approaches.\n\nVerification by analogy is often used in the con-\ntext of analysis. Here, it is shown that a certain part\nwill behave similarly to another part which has already\nbeen qualified for another project under equivalent\nor even more severe requirements or load conditions.\nThis, of course, requires that all information concer-\nning the previous qualification process is available,\nincluding the exact hardware configuration and the\napplied operational conditions. If not, further delta\nqualification steps might be required.\n\nExperimental demonstration is performed with\nthe actual hardware or software in a simulator or ina\nsimulated operational environment. In the framework\nof the Ariane program, further demonstration tests are\nperformed within the ARTA program after launcher\nqualification for statistical proof of low deviations\nand tolerances. In this program, parts from the actual\nmanufacturing process are taken and subjected to\nrepresentative investigations.\n\nTypical inspection methods are nondestructive,\nlike visual inspections, X-ray investigation, weighing,\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nhelium leak tests, etc. Others involve regular monitor-\ning of the manufacturing processes and the respective\nfacilities.\n\nAcceptance tests (see Table 3.5.1) are performed\n\nregularly at all system levels (components, subsystems\nand the entire system). In contrast to the more de-\ntailed and comprehensive development and qualifica-\ntion tests, the acceptance tests are usually performed\nin the later production and operation phase in order\nto limit risks. Acceptance tests provide the proof that\na part or system is within the specified tolerance\nconcerning its functions and that it is free of defects\nand integration failures. The test loads applied dur-\ning the acceptance test are significantly below the\ndimensioning loads applied in the qualification phase.\nAcceptance test conditions are also applied after refur-\nbishing the launcher or when replacing components\nafter a launch abort.\nUsually qualification tests are distinguished as\nbeing either mechanical or functional qualification\ntests, and ground or flight qualification tests. Ground\nqualification tests might be performed on prototype\nmodels, proto-flight models or scaled models. Quali-\nfication tests may be limited to certain dimensioning\nflight phases or cover the full extent of the life cycle.\nThese tests may be designed for a specific load case or\n\u2018or a combination of different load cases. Some tests\nmay be performed until the failure of the unit under\ntest, others simply within the nominal operational\nconditions for the unit. This variety is driven by the\nneed to cover all critical areas of the product life cycle.\nSometimes it is difficult to deduce the reliability of a\nsystem from a single qualification test, even though\nthe test was performed until rupture.\n\nIt is practically impossible to simulate all flight\nconditions in a single test facility, particularly when\na combination of conditions or loads has to be con-\n\nsidered simultaneously. In addition, sometimes not\nall parameters are accessible by direct measurement\nso they have to be determined via other representative\nmeasurements. In some cases the increased intensity\nof other test parameters, for example the number\nof load cycles, may help to deduce the test objective\nas well.\n\nQualification tests are used to consolidate the\nrequired margins of safety and to characterize opera-\ntional and functional behavior.

For proving operational\nand mission readiness of the ground segment, in prin-\nciple the same approach as for space flight equipment\napplies. However, other requirements and test meth-\nods are used to demonstrate the functioning of all\ninstallations and their coherency within the complete\nsystem; the communications network, all nominal and\nbackup operational procedures, and last but not least\nthe decision procedure\u2019s operational suitability. The\nqualification measures related to the ground segment\nare called verification of operational readiness.\nConcerning the launch vehicle itself, the starting\npoint for any qualification process is the verifica-\ntion matrix, which is subdivided into a number of\nrequirement categories for better overview. These\ncategories may vary depending on the specific project\nrequirements; however, some typical categories for\nlaunch systems are:\ne Mechanical system\ne Thermal system\ne Electromagnetic compatibility\ne Mission\ne Configuration\ne Guidance, navigation and control\ne Propulsion\n\nc03.indd 195\n\ne Communication\n\ne Data management\ne Flight operations\n\ne Ground operations\ne Support\n\ne Human factors.\n\n3.5.3 Mechanical Qualification\n\nAs an example, mechanical qualification is considered\nhere in terms of mechanical tests to prove the struc-\ntural readiness of the launcher. This also seems to be\nof particular interest, since due to the large size of a\nlaunch vehicle special requirements have to be defined\nto plan and to perform the qualification steps. Accord-\ningly, qualification is often performed on complete\nlaunch vehicle stages.\n\nThe objectives of the mechanical qualification are:\n\n1. To demonstrate the ability of the equipment to\n\nwithstand the expected static and dynamic loads\n\nwith a sufficient safety margin.\n\n2. To validate that the dynamic behavior of the struc-\n\nture has been correctly characterized by analytical\n\nmodels, which is of particular importance for the\nflight loads analysis.\n\n3. To demonstrate that the functional structural\ncomponents comply with the required static and\ndynamic performance requirements with suf-\nficient margins of safety.\n\n& 2/27/09 12:51:56 AM\n",
    "217": "CHO3.indd 196\n\n196\n\n4. To demonstrate that the operation of the launch\nvehicle is assured under the dynamic loads.\n\nThe relevant mechanical test methods (vibration\ntest, static test, acoustic test, pyroshock screening and\nmodal test) are explained in more detail in Section 8.3.\nIn this context, however, the application of these test\napproaches to launch vehicles is discussed, addressing\nboth mechanical strength and operational readiness.\n\nDue to the size of launch vehicles, the respective\nqualification measures are practically restricted to the\nmain constituents of a launcher, usually the launcher\nstages or major subsystems. Accordingly, within the\nscope of the complete system qualification approach,\nit has to be ensured that all subassemblies are sepa-\nrately qualified, in particular when their individual\nqualification is not possible on a higher integration\nlevel. For example: the qualification of a propellant\nline is mainly performed on the line itself, even if\nthis line is later integrated into the stage qualifica-\ntion model.\n\nTo enable the testing of the launch vehicle main\nconstituents or stages, it is mandatory that their in-\nterfaces and operational conditions are well defined\nand considered prior to testing. For example, since the\npropellant constitutes most of the launch vehicle\u2019s\nmass, the different tank fill rates and how they change\nduring the mission have to be considered during test-\ning with respect to the static and dynamic behavior.\nThis may mean that several configurations, namely\ntank fill rates, have to be tested. Another example is\nthat stage separation changes the boundary condi-\ntions from being restrained and clamped to free mov-\ning, and together with the changes in the propulsion\nduring the staging sequence, the loads and fluxes alter\nsignificantly.\n\nThe size of the structures, the complex nature of\nthe boundary conditions and the permanent changes\nin mass and enviromental conditions during flight\nrequire that mechanical tests be comprehensively\nplanned, that representative structural models be\nprovided at an early development step, and that con-\nsiderable effort be undertaken to prepare or modify\ntest facilities, in particular cases even to build new\ntest facilities and to prepare dedicated jigs and load-\ning devices. Consequently, the preparation and test\nevaluation phases are correspondingly long.\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\nTaking the example of Ariane 5 launch vehicle\ndevelopment, some of the mechanical tests and\ntheir specific requirements and objectives are listed\nbelow.\n\nStatic Tests: Measurement of the fluxes, in particu-\nlar close to the introduction points of the booster loads\ninto the thin-walled structures; experimental verifica-\ntion of the stiffness matrices for the main and upper\nstage composites with respect to the fundamental\ncompression and bending load cases; demonstration\nof the proof pressure of the stage propellant tanks;\nverification of the ultimate load and the damping\ncharacteristics of the elastic link elements between the\nboosters and the main stage under compression loads\ncombined with thermal and dynamic stress.\n\nVibration Tests: Dynamic qualification of the\nmain engine, since the engine\u2019s operation loads are\nsupplemented by the vibration loads occurring at\nthe lower section of the main stage; vibration test on\nthe upper stage to verify the dynamic strength and to\ninvestigate the vibration and damping characteristics\nof the upper stage tanks; experimental verification of\nthe effectiveness of the damper system of the upper\nstage\u2019s main tank.

Finally, it should be noted that some parameters\ncannot or can only to a certain extent be realized in\na laboratory environment. For instance, the use of\nreal propellant is often prohibited because of the\ncryogenic temperatures, explosion hazards and toxic-\nity. Therefore, the differences in mass density of the\nreplacement fluids has to be considered. Application\nof the real flight pressure is also impossible due to the\n\nCHO3.indd 197\n\n197\n\ninherent risk of a tank rupturing during the test. These\ndifferences, as well as mechanical boundary condi-\ntions which can only be realized in an approximated\nsense, must be taken into account in the mathemati-\ncal models used for the test prediction. Accordingly,\nduring the first flights additional measurements are\nperformed to provide further evidence for the quali-\nfication status.\n\n3.5.4 Functional Qualification\n\nFunctional qualification comprises thermal, ther-\nmal\u2014functional and propulsion system verification.\nThermal engineering determines the thermal fluxes\ninto, and temperatures of, the structures, components\nand propellant. Moreover, the thermal design of the\nlauncher is specified. Specific challenges are thermal\nfluxes due to aerodynamic heating, aerothermal in-\nteraction with the engine exhaust, and determination\nof the propellant temperatures inside the tanks (in\nparticular when considering interactions with fluid\ndynamic effects). The role of thermal engineering\nwithin the verification process is to determine a re-\npresentative thermal environment for structural and\nthermal\u2014functional tests, to determine test conditions\nand sensor installations, to analyze the thermal behav-\nior during test, to investigate thermal anomalies which\noccur during flight, to assess and correlate ground and\nflight test data with analytical thermal models, and to\nreview the efficiency of the thermal design.\n\nThermal-functional verification deals with\ntests for filling and draining propellant fluids and,\napplicable to cryogenic propellants, determining the\ntemperatures and pressures during these operations.\nFurther activities are checking the pressurization\nprocedures for the propellant tanks, filling and venting\nthe tank pressurization systems, determining pressure\nloss in lines and investigating dynamic flow effects,\ndetermining suitable mass flow rates for the ventilation\nof cavities inside the stage, investigating gas flow rates\nfor the local conditioning of equipment, detecting and\nanalyzing leakage, determining expansion flow rates\nfor the evacuation of lines, and reviewing the efficiency\nof these operations and the functional design. Finally,\nthe analytical models are correlated with the experi-\nmental results and updated, when required.\n\n2/24/09 3:20:35 PM\n",
    "219": "CHO3.indd 198\n\n198\n\nThe qualification of the propulsion systems\nconsiders both the transient and stationary opera-\ntional phases of the engines. In doing so, each single\ncomponent, like pumps, igniter and thrust chamber,\nas well as the complete engine are verified. The test\ninvolving the whole engine is called the firing test.\nWhen involving the entire propulsion system and\nthe stage, the test is called stage hot firing test. The\npreparation of hot firing tests requires the intense co-\noperation of all engineering disciplines involved, since,\nfor instance, the gas flow in the engine may excite\nsignificant structural vibrations at the engine nozzle or\nthe feed lines. The running engine causes high thermal\nstress (thermal radiation, hot exhaust gas flow) for the\nengine, the test stand and the environment as well. It\nis quite complex to operate on the upper stage under\nreal vacuum conditions on the grotind. Therefore, in\nso-called development tests, the behavior of engine\ncomponents and partial engine working cycles are\nverified, applying water or gas flow tests. During en-\ngine qualification all relevant operational modes and\nfunctions (operational box) are tested, in particular\nthe transient phases like ignition and run-up, as well\nas the shutdown phase. Instable conditions during\nignition or later during nominal combustion may\nquickly lead to engine loss, since the combustion of\nthe propellant is a highly energetic process. Irregular\nexpulsion of gas may lead to hot spots which may\nmelt the material of the nozzle throat. Hot firing tests\non main stage engines or booster engines have to\nconsider that high vibration and acoustic loads may\noccur and easily lead to fatigue failures on the nozzle\nor other engine parts. If the engine uses regenerative\ncooling, the correct function of this system must of\ncourse be shown before any hot firing takes place.\nFinally, for cryogenic engines specific operations\nlike the cooling phase of the lines and components\n\n3 Space Transportation Systems\n\ndown to the propellant temperature (chilling down)\nhave to be verified. A particular testing problem with\nmain stage engines arises from the fact that during\nthe ascent phase they are operated against decreasing\natmospheric pressure. Tests must accordingly consider\nthis fact. A similar problem exists with upper stage\nengines which are ignited and operated in vacuum.\nConsequently, the final qualification of an engine\nusually ends with the qualification flight.\n\nFurther Activities after Qualification\n\nOnce the qualification flight is completed, the launch\nvehicle enters the consolidation phase. Results and\ninsights from the qualification flight might lead to\nnecessary changes in hardware and software. As a fur-\nther consequence, the flight measurement equipment\nis reduced step by step to the essential minimum for\nthe next flights. For the beginning of serial production,\nthe configuration of the launcher must be frozen in\norder to achieve a generic qualification.\n\nThen the production process is stabilized and,\nwhenever required, optimized. From time to time the\nmanufacturer of a certain part may change during\nthe production phase. This requires the provision of\nspecific acceptance tests to ensure acceptable quality\naccording to the specification after the change of the\nproduction source. In this phase special attention is\ngiven to manufacturing alterations, obsolescenses, and\nflight anomalies. It has to be proven in a continuous\nprocess that even in the case of alterations the com-\nplete system still remains qualified within its nominal\noperations with respect to the specifications.\n\nIf the launcher system has to be adapted to spe-\ncific mission profiles which are not fully covered\nby the generic qualification, a delta qualification\nof subsystems or even the whole system might be\nrequired.\n\n2/24/09 3:20:37 PM\n",

Therefore, an environment must\nbe generated within the spacecraft which allows all\nsubsystems and components to be operated within the\nspecified and acceptable temperature tolerances. To\nachieve this, the temperatures have to be monitored\nand controlled by passive or active methods inside the\nspacecraft. This is explained and shown by realistic\nexamples.\n\nThe first spacecraft were carried directly into\ntheir target orbit by a rocket. They lacked their own\npropulsion system. Today, most spacecraft are equip-\nped with a propulsion system to maintain or change\ntheir orbit. This is usually achieved by propulsion\nsystems based on thermodynamic or electrodynamic\nprocesses. Depending on the mission and propulsion\ntype, the propellant quantities have to be adjusted.\nFor example, to change from a transfer orbit to a\ngeostationary orbit the required propellant quan-\ntity is nearly half the mass of the satellite itself, in\nthe case of chemical propulsion. In most cases, the\npropulsion systems serve to maintain and correct\nthe orbit or to initiate planned orbit maneuvers.\nThe use of electrical propulsion systems reduces the\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nrequired propellant quantities significantly. The on-\nboard propellant quantities and their economical use\nare essential aspects of the duration of a mission. At\nthe end of a mission, a certain quantity of propellant\nmust be conserved so that the spacecraft can perform\ncontrolled deorbiting or vacate its orbital position.\n\nBesides the precise positioning of a spacecraft\nin an orbit, often the attitude of the spacecraft is\nof importance for the success of a mission. Early\nspacecraft were stabilized by rotation around their\nown axis. Today, most satellites have to be operated\nin precisely defined and maintained orientations,\nor, as in the case of Earth observation satellites, they\nhave to point precisely at a selected target on the\nground. To achieve this, an attitude control system\nhas to determine and adjust the orientation. In the\nsection describing attitude control, it will be shown\nhow a selected attitude and motion can be achieved,\nstarting from an initial attitude and motion. Sensors\nlike gyros, accelerometers, star sensors, GPS, etc., and\nactuators like torquers and electromagnetic coils are\napplied for the purpose.\n\nTogether with the payload, the various subsystems\nform a network which is controlled by one or more\non-board processors. Often payload and platform\ntasks are distributed between two or more subsystems\nwhich communicate with each other. The processors\nare interconnected among each other and with all\nmeasurement devices, sensors, actuators and other\nmodules of the spacecraft. The control system is re-\nsponsible for achieving maximum autonomy for the\nspacecraft. This requires not only high computing\npower, but often also very high software complexity.\nIn addition, this subsystem has to be highly reliable,\nfault tolerant and if possible self-healing \u2014 and all\nwithin a small volume with low mass \u2014 and still be\noperational under the extreme environmental con-\nditions of space.\n\nA spacecraft can only perform its mission if it\nis linked to a ground station for control and data\nreception. Depending on mission requirements, a\nspace system needs a communication system with a\nreliable and ground-station-compatible transmission\ncapability, to guarantee a stable link to the Earth.\n\nThe various subsystems of a satellite cannot be\nregarded independently of each other. They are lin-\nked and interconnected and influence each other.\n\n2/24/09 3:38:37 PM\n",

Thus the success of a\nspace mission depends on the complex interoperation\nof all subsystems, which is described in more detail in\nthe following sections.\n\n4.1 Structure and Mechanisms\n\nJoachim Block and Johannes Kreuser\n(4.1.5.6, 4.1.5.7)\n\nIn organizational charts and listings displaying the\nsubsystems of a spacecraft the structure appears very\noften in first place, usually followed by power supply\nand thermal control. This first place has less to do\nwith any \u201cranking\u201d than with the sequence in which\nthe subsystems become design drivers. Like the hull\nof a ship in the shipbuilding process between keel\nlaying and launching, the structure of a spacecraft de-\ntermines the overall configuration already at an early\nphase of the development process, and also needs to\nbe qualified first. Consequently, the first qualification\nmodel of a satellite is usually the structural-thermal\nmodel (STM). If it does not satisfy the requirements,\nthen possibly the whole configuration and all the\nmechanical interfaces will need to be redesigned from\nscratch. This later becomes almost impossible unless\nyears of delay are taken into account. On the other\nhand, a redesign within the electronic subsystems, for\ninstance, is in most cases still possible at a later stage\nof the design process without endangering the course\nof the project as such.\n\nThe discussion of mechanisms in this chap-\nter focuses on those which are directly related to\nthe structural mechanics of the overall spacecraft\nand which therefore need to be considered in conjunc-\ntion with the structure. This comprises all mechanisms\nwhich serve for the locking, releasing, deployment and\nactive mobility of essential spacecraft components\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:203\n\n203\n\n(e.g., antennas, solar cell arrays, deployment booms)\nrelative to the primary structure.\n\n4.1.1 The Primary Structure of the\nSpacecraft\n\nThe load-carrying cell of a spacecraft, which deter-\nmines its global strength and stiffness, and upon\nwhich all other units are fastened, is defined as the\nprimary structure. From the stiffness of the primary\nstructure and the mass distribution of the various sys-\ntem and payload units mounted on it, the resonance\nbehavior, that is the eigenfrequencies under dynamic\nload, can be calculated. Normally an approximate\ncalculation of the eigenfrequencies is already required\nin the second phase of a project in order to check\ncompatibility with the specifications of the envisaged\nlauncher (rocket, shuttle).\n\n4.1.1.1 Design Drivers and Dimensioning Load\nCases\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 4.1.1, the first, still rough\nconcepts for the basic structural configuration of a\nspacecraft emerge at the beginning of the project in\nthe first phase, Phase A, based on the objective of the\nmission. For instance, a free-flying satellite with a\nmainly electronic payload looks principally different\nfrom a space telescope, which is designed around a\ntube, or from a planetary lander with landing gear or\nairbags. The requirements of the mission-determining\nmain payloads act as design drivers, in the beginning\nmainly as geometry drivers, and must be made com-\npatible with the constraints of the envisaged launcher.\nIn cases where the volume under the fairing must be\nshared with other satellites, even these constraints\nmust be considered from the beginning.\n\nThis initial draft specification of the spacecraft\nstructure is then, in the course of the subsequent pro-\nject phase, Phase B, subjected to thorough numerical\nanalyses by means of a first finite element model.\nThese analyses prove the basic feasibility of the struc-\ntural concept and exclude potential \u201cshowstoppers\u201d\nas long as the construction process is still flexible\n\n2/24/09 3:38:38 PM\n",

The following material classes are\nrelevant for this purpose [4.1.3]\n\nMetallic Alloys\n\nAs in aircraft construction, the classic aluminum\nalloys still hold the leading position among the me-\ntallic structural materials in the field of spacecraft\nconstruction, followed by titanium-based alloys\n[4.1.4], [4.1.5]. In parallel, novel materials are gai-\nning importance for special applications, for instance\nberyllium alloys, which are extremely light in weight\nand have excellent mechanical properties, but on\nthe other hand are very problematic to process and\nmanufacture, in particular because of their extreme\ntoxicity.\n\n2/24/09 3:38:40 PM\n",

Manufacturing from solid\nmetal, for instance the monolithic manufacturing\nof electronic boxes, is usually performed by coun-\ntersinking with a computer-controlled fraise (see\nSection 4.1.1.3).\n\nFiber Composites\n\nThe development and steady improvement of carbon\nfibers [4.1.6] over the last few decades has paved the\nway for the leading role of carbon fiber-reinforced\nplastic (CFRP) laminates in modern aerospace en-\ngineering. Laminates composed of high-modulus\nor high-tenacity carbon fibers embedded in a ther-\nmosetting matrix (mostly epoxy resin) are today the\nbackbone of the structural technology for space ap-\nplications [4.1.7], [4.1.8], [4.1.9], [4.1.10]. Laminates\nwith thermoplastic matrices, on the other hand, are\nof minor importance in space due to their lower heat\nresistance.\n\nFlat laminates are frequently manufactured from\npre-impregnated fiber layers (prepregs), while for\nstructures with large curvatures and more complex\nforms it is better to first position the still dry carbon\nfiber layers (fabric etc.) in a mold and then imp-\nregnate them with the still-liquid matrix resin. For\nthe manufacturing of structures with approximately\nrotational symmetry, such as cylinders or tanks, the\ndry fiber roving is pulled through an immersion\nbasin with liquid epoxy before it is wrapped around\nthe rotating preform (filament winding technique).\nIn all cases the hardening and curing are performed\nin an autoclave.\n\nOccasionally glass fibers or aramid fibers are also\nused (the latter consisting of aromatic polyamides and\nsold under such trademarks as Kevlar, Twaron or No-\nmex), in particular when the good electrical and ther-\nmal conductivity of carbon fibers is undesirable.\n\nOne of the most common combinations of fiber\ncomposites with metals in the same structure are\nsandwich plates with CFRP face sheets and an alu-\nminum honeycomb core (see Section 4.1.1.3). For\nmany applications this combination represents the\noptimal solution.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFiber-Metal Composites\n\nThis material class comprises hybrid materials such\nas fiber\u2014-metal laminates (FMLs), which consist of\nthin metallic sheets that are mixed layer by layer with\ncarbon fiber, glass fiber or aramid fiber layers (GLARE,\nARALL, etc.), as well as metal matrix composites\n(MMCs), which combine the mechanical advantages\nof fiber composites with a much higher temperature\nresistance, at the price of higher weight. They already\nhave a bridging function to composites that are deci-\ndedly high-temperature materials.\n\nHigh-Temperature Materials\n\nFor extremely high temperatures as occur during\nhypersonic flight through the atmosphere, for in-\nstance during the reentry of envisioned reusable\nspace vehicles, materials made of ceramic matrix\ncomposites (CMCs), carbon/carbon compounds\n(C/C) and silicon carbide compounds (C/SiC) are\nbeing developed.\n\nTable 4.1.1 gives a global overview of the most im-\nportant properties and parameters of all these materi-\nals.

In most cases the latter is a honey-\ncomb core with hexagonal cells, but corrugated metal\nsheets, sheets with a zigzag profile, or hard foam cores\nare used as well.\n\nThe preferred core material is aluminum, while\naramid fiber paper (Nomex), which is quite common\nin aircraft construction, is not often used in space ap-\nplications because of the environmental conditions.\n\nFigure 4.1.3 shows in principle the composition\nof a sandwich plate with a honeycomb core with he-\nxagonal cells. Its mechanical properties, in particular\nits strength and stiffness under tension, compression,\nshear and bending loads, depend decisively on the face\nsheet thickness, the core thickness, the cell size and the\nthickness of the honeycomb cell walls - apart from\nthe pure material properties as such. Here it must be\nnoted that, due to the manufacturing of the honey-\ncomb core from individual thin ribbons which are\nfolded and then glued together at the points depicted\nin Figure 4.1.3, the mechanical properties in the length\ndirection differ from those in the width direction.\n\nSince adhesion between the honeycomb core and\nthe sandwich face sheets is achieved by means of an\nadhesive film which creeps into the fillets between\nthe inner side of the face sheet and the cell walls per-\npendicular to it and hardens there, the cells would\nbe hermetically closed if venting were neglected. By\nperforating the ribbon material in the course of ho-\nneycomb core manufacturing it is assured that after\nlaunch of the spacecraft the air enclosed in the cells\ncan quickly evacuate through small holes or slits.\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:207\n\n207\n\nFigure 4.1.4: Small satellite structure composed of sandwich plates\n(Source: DLR).\n\nThe large number of sandwich parameters (parti-\ncularly if the face sheet is not isotropic but a multidi-\nrectional fiber laminate) makes it possible to \u201ctailor\u201d\na variety of sandwich properties, but makes their\nanalytical calculation rather complex. It would go far\nbeyond the scope of this handbook to derive and dis-\ncuss all the corresponding formulas from some general\nbasic equations down to a level practically usable for\nsandwich analysis. Therefore, reference is made to\nsome excellent books on the subject, such as those by\nPlantema [4.1.11], Allen [4.1.12] and Altenbach et al.\n[4.1.13]. For the dimensioning of fiber composite face\nsheets see Michaeli et al. [4.1.14].\n\nSpacecraft structures can be composed of sand-\nwich plates in different basic geometrical forms. The\nsimplest case is illustrated in Figure 4.1.4 [4.1.15] and\nis representative of many small satellites. Their basic\nform is a cube or cuboid where five of the six sides are\nlightweight sandwich plates and the sixth is a more\nmassive bottom plate. This configuration can be easily\nfolded together and is therefore easy to integrate as\nwell.

The surrounding sand-\nwich plates form several individual compartments for\naccommodation of the payloads. Figure 4.1.5 shows a\nhalf-finished structural model of the orbiter for ESA\u2019s\ncomet mission Rosetta. Since the middle sandwich\nplate on the front side is still missing, one can recog-\nnize the central tube and the \u201chard points\u201d for later\nfixation of the Rosetta lander.

The whole configuration is covered by the solar\nhood that carries the solar arrays, some cameras and\nabsorbers, and is an integral part of the load-bearing\nprimary structure in spite of its extremely lightweight\ndesign.\n\nIn some satellites the sandwich plates are arranged\none level over the other, connected by a truss of stiff\nrods.

On the other hand, their integration\nis very time consuming and expensive, in particular\nif hundreds or thousands of rivets (or screws, or\nadhesive connections) are required to complete the\nstructure as a whole (Figure 4.1.8).\n\nThe advantage of being relatively resistant to\ncrack propagation (because cracks end at the edges\nof the individual components or at the bearings of\nthe screw or rivet holes and do not propagate through\nthe entire component) is offset by the relatively high\nweight. Therefore it is not surprising that during\nthe last few decades, in view of the growing importance\nof modern fiber composites on the one hand, and the\ndevelopment of modern computer numerical control\n(CNC) manufacturing techniques on the other hand,\nthe traditional methods of differential construction\nhave taken a back seat.\n\nMonolithic Construction\nThe philosophy pursued in monolithic (or \u201cintegral\u201d)\nconstruction is just the opposite of the approach used\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:209\n\n209\n\nFigure 4.1.8: Skin and stringer in a differential construction.\n\nin differential construction: ideally the whole struc-\nture consists of a single monolithic piece, or is at least\ncomposed of only a few large parts.\n\nIf monolithic metallic structures are considered,\nthe only really feasible production technique is manuf-\nacturing from the solid by means of CNC tools.

The theoretical\nalternative for producing monolithic metallic parts\nby casting is practically irrelevant for space structure\ntechnology, apart from rare exceptional cases.\n\nCertainly it is true that for large dimensions,\nstructures composed of sandwich panels are clear-\nly lighter in weight than corresponding \u201cintegral\u201d\nmonolithic structures because milling and grinding\nfrom the solid material cannot be accomplished to\nachieve such extremely thin wall thicknesses as are\npossible with sandwiches.

As long as the\nrequired wall thickness is no larger than several mil-\nlimeters, skilled personnel can manufacture structural\nparts of high quality on such a mold even by simple\nhand lamination (Figure 4.1.9), because the homo-\ngeneous interpenetration of fiber material and liquid\nlamination resin (epoxy) can be directly observed.

The main influ-\nences are:\n\ne The omnipresent high vacuum\n\ne High-energy radiation from the Sun and from\nthe galactic background (ultraviolet, X-ray and\ngamma radiation, see Figure 2.1.2)\n\ne High-energy particles (protons, neutrons, elec-\ntrons, alpha particles) from the solar wind and in\nthe Van Allen belts of the Earth\n\ne Atomic oxygen (in low Earth orbits).\n\nThe high vacuum leads to a mass loss of all structural\nmaterials which contain volatiles. This does not con-\ncern metals, but all plastic materials including fiber\ncomposites. Since the corresponding external vapor\npressure is zero, these materials lose their volatiles,\nprimarily water molecules, by outgassing. This de-\nhydration may not just lead to critical embrittlement\nof the material itself. Even more critical is the subse-\nquent condensation of the volatiles on other parts of\nthe spacecraft, for instance on camera lenses, mirrors\nand other sensitive sensor surfaces, which can blind\ntheir field of view.\n\nSpaceborne structural materials are therefore sub-\nject to strict outgassing criteria which are summarized\nin a pertinent ECSS standard [4.1.21]. Compliance\nwith this standard must be verified by outgassing tests\n(Figure 4.1.12).\n\nAfter a preceding conditioning phase under nor-\nmal ambient temperature and humidity, a sample of\nthe material is heated for 24 hours at 125 \u00b0C in a va-\ncuum so it can outgas. Immediately prior to and after\nthe outgassing phase the sample is weighed so that the\ntotal mass loss (TML) can be determined. During a\nfollowing second conditioning phase the sample is\nagain saturated with water molecules (water vapor\nregained (WVR)) so that the recovered mass loss\n(RML) can be determined by the difference in weight.\nIn addition to this procedure a sensitive collector plate\nin the test device is used to measure the amount of\nsolid particles which are emanating from the sam-\nple during the outgassing phase (collected volatile\n\nCHO4.indd Sect:211\n\n211\nConditioning Outgassing Conditioning\n22\u00b0C at at 125\u00b0C 22\u00b0C at\n55% RH | p<i0-%Pa, 55% RH\n| N.\nroa\nRML\n3 im |\n& y__}wvr\nQ\no\no\n=\n0 24 48 72\n\nFigure 4.1.12: Outgassing test according to ECSS-Q-70-02A.\n\ncondensable material (CVCM)). If not otherwise spe-\ncified, the acceptance criteria for spaceborne materials\nare TML < 1% and CVCM < 0.1%. In the vicinity of\noptical instruments even RML < 0.1% and CVCM\n< 0.01% are often required [4.1.3].\n\nIn view of the material degradation caused by\nultraviolet radiation and high-energy particles which\nmay gradually destroy molecular bonds in the ma-\nterial, it is necessary to estimate the lifetime dose to\nwhich the spacecraft will be exposed. Apart from the\nmission duration itself, this dose depends of course\non the local environment; that is, on whether the\nspacecraft is operating in a low Earth orbit, beyond\nthe Van Allen belts, in deep space far from the Sun, etc.\nAlso, the possible coincidence of the mission duration\nwith phases of strong solar activity within the 11-year\ncycle of the Sun may be significant.\n\nAgain fiber composite materials with their poly-\nmeric matrix are more vulnerable to the destructive\ninfluence of high-energy photons or particles [4.1.22]\nthan are metallic alloys. Protection of their surfaces\nis therefore mandatory. Common metallized Kapton\nfoils or MLI blankets which are primarily used as\nthermal insulation for satellites and space probes\nprovide considerable protection against short-wave\nelectromagnetic radiation, even though high-energy\nparticles may still penetrate through these covers.\nAnother option is to laminate thin protective me-\ntallic foils directly on carbon fiber laminate surfaces.\nDue to the different thermal expansion coefficients\none might expect clefts or creases in the foil, but it is\npossible to avoid them (see the covered face sheet in\nFigure 4.1.3).

The problem of surface charging is parti-\ncularly important in a geostationary orbit where the\nplasma environment may lead to strong local charge\ndifferences between different parts of the spacecraft\n[4.1.23]. Voltages up to several kilovolts can be gene-\nrated and lead to sudden destructive discharges if they\nare not prevented by proper \u201cgrounding\u201d by conduc-\ntive connections among the different surface areas.\n\nFinally, for missions in a low Earth orbit it should\nbe considered whether atomic oxygen might have a\ndegrading effect (for all other trajectories this can\ncertainly be neglected from the outset). Atomic oxygen\nis generated by the dissociation of oxygen molecules\nin the highest parts of the atmosphere by solar UV\nradiation, where the influence of the solar activity cyc-\nles increases sharply with increasing altitude [4.1.23].\nIn particular, carbon fiber structures are sensitive to\natomic oxygen, but practical experience has shown\nthat a normal satellite structure does not accumulate\nso much damage during its lifetime that the effect will\nbecome dangerous. For smaller parts, however, and\nfor certain sensor structures in particular, the effect\nof atomic oxygen should not be neglected.\n\n4.1.1.5 Inserts\n\nFor the fixation of payload boxes, service units of other\nsubsystems, and all kind of secondary structures on\nthe primary structure, a large number of screwing\npoints are needed. In the case of a monolithically\nmanufactured (\u201cintegral\u201d) structure it is possible to\ndrill holes into the material, to tap suitable threads\ninto them and to optionally apply helicoils. If the\nstructure has been made in the traditional (\u201cdiffe-\nrential\u201d) manner, then cages for screw nuts or other\nthread-carrying elements can be welded, glued or\nriveted onto the structure.\n\nInserts in the usual sense of the word, however,\nare thread-carrying elements embedded in sandwich\npanels. They are by far the dominant fixation elements\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nCFRP tube insert\n\nFace sheet Insert\n\nPotting\n\nSandwich honeycomb core\nFigure 4.1.13: Inserts in a sandwich panel.\n\non spacecraft structures and can be classified into two\nbasic forms: so-called through-the-thickness inserts,\nwhich go through the whole sandwich panel, so that\nthe screw head and the unit to be fastened are on\nopposite sides; and the alternative version, so-called\nblind inserts, which involve unilateral inserts where\nthe screw and the unit remain on the same side.\n\nBoth basic versions exist in various technical forms\n[4.1.24]. The standard form of a unilateral blind insert\nis embedded in the sandwich panel by the so-called\npotting procedure (see Figure 4.1.13, center). At first\na borehole is drilled which is a bit deeper than the\nmetallic insert element, but equal in diameter. Opti-\nonally the honeycomb cells touched by the drill are\nthen closed at their remaining upper edge with some\npasty epoxy resin so that, upon the following injection\nof liquid resin, this cannot flow into the \u201cdepths\u201d of\nthe sandwich. For comparatively thin sandwich panels\nthis resin-saving step is of course not worthwhile,\nand the hole in the honeycomb core is then drilled\nthrough to the lower face sheet.\n\nAfter implementation and alignment of the insert\nby means of an appropriate tool, liquid resin is injected\nthrough one of two holes in the insert cap, until the\nhollow space in the borehole around the central insert\nshank is completely filled and the resin pours out of\nthe second hole. After hardening, each insert of this\ntype provides a fastening opportunity for screws from\nM3 up to M6 and a load range of several kilonewtons,\nand contributes 4\u20147 g to the structural mass.\n\n2/24/09 3:39:12 PM\n",

For certain combi-\nnations of sandwich parameters it provides a better\nratio between mass and load capability than does the\nconventional design. Here the borehole goes in any case\nthrough the whole thickness of the sandwich core, but\nits diameter is smaller than for the potting alternati-\nve. Drilling through the lower face sheet is optional.\nThe borehole is then circumferentially wetted with\nsome epoxy resin, and a foldable CFRP tube with\nextreme longitudinal stiffness, which is also wetted\nwith resin on its outer side, is inserted into the hole.\nBy means of a suitable tool this tube is subsequently\nunfolded to its full diameter, aligned, and positioned\nsuch that both tube ends fit exactly under the edges\nof the face sheet holes. Thus the whole length of the\ntube comes into adhesive contact with the surrounding\nhoneycomb cell walls. After hardening, an aluminum\ninsert which is in form-locking contact with a surroun-\nding CFRP sleeve is glued into the tube [4.1.25].\n\nBoth inserts outlined in Figure 4.1.13 are so-called\nflush-mounted inserts: that is, their cap surface, on\nwhich the fastened units are tightly screwed, is flush\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:213\n\n213\n\nwith the surface of the sandwich face sheet. For most\ninsert types, however, it is also possible to let the\ninsert cap protrude above the face sheet (protruding\ninserts), as shown for comparison in Figure 4.1.14.\nThe latter option allows for later collective abrasion\nof all inserts implemented in the same panel up to a\ncommon interface plane above the sandwich surface.\nAny local unevenness of the sandwich can thus be\ncorrected.\n\nAll inserts must be implemented into the structure\nsuch that they cannot loosen during assembly and\nintegration when the screws are tightened with the\nappropriate torque specified for the respective thread\nsize. For fixation on space structures it is customary to\nuse titanium screws (e.g., TiAI6V4) with a rolled thread\nand a hexagonal socket screw head. Since in particular\nthe random dynamic loads occurring during the\nlaunch phase can easily lead to unscrewing, it is usual\nto additionally secure the insert threads with screw-\nlocking elements, for instance bronze helicoils.\n\n4.1.1.6 Manufacture and Integration\n\nAs already described in Section 4.1.1.3, the choice of\n\nthe appropriate manufacturing technology for the\n\nbody shell work on a primary spacecraft structure\ndepends on both the construction principle and the\n\nmaterial. This initial body shell work is in any case a\n\n\u201cdirty\u201d process, no matter whether it consists of the\n\nlamination of monolithic CFRP shells, the manufac-\n\nturing of sandwich plates, or the milling, grinding and\nriveting of metallic sheet pieces.\n\nThe subsequent qualitative step from the \u201craw\u201d\nbody shell to the classified spacecraft structure, which\nthen becomes the mechanical base for all further\nintegration steps, involves three procedures:\n\n1. Cleaning: The cleaning of the manufactured struc-\nture coincides with the transfer of all following\nactivities to a clean room. It includes the removal\nof all loose dirt particles, swarfs, etc., by purging\nwith compressed pure nitrogen, as well as the\nelimination of all surface impurities by washing\nwith isopropyl. Fiber composite structures should\nhave been cured once again at approximately 90 \u00b0C\nbefore this cleaning.\n\n2. Verification: This involves exact weighing of the\nstructure, or its constituent primary components,\n\n2/24/09 3:39:13 PM\n",

Moreover, the position of the cen-\nter of gravity (CoG) and, if required, the moment\nof inertia (MoI) in all three axes are experimentally\ndetermined.\n\n3. Configuration Control: All structural parts are\nnow subject to configuration control. The rule for\ntheir labeling is that all monolithically connected\nparts have one and the same label, while all remo-\nvable parts have a separate label.\n\nDuring the following integration the structure\nmust be freely accessible, and its attitude must be\nadjustable in any desired position relative to the\nground. Therefore the structure must be fastened\nin a rigid framework, usually made of steel, with the\nrequired geometrical degrees of freedom, the so-called\nmechanical ground support equipment (MGSE).\nIt allows for the pivoting of the nascent spacecraft\nunder normal terrestrial gravity and makes sure that\nlightweight structural parts which are designed for\nuse in weightlessness are not accidentally overloaded\nduring the ground operations. The mechanical inter-\nfaces for the fixation of the structure in the MGSE are\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\ntherefore particularly important. Their number and\nload-carrying capability are selected such that even for\nlarge spacecraft the maneuver loads on the ground can\nnever become a design-driving load case.\n\n4.1.2 Secondary and Deployable\nStructures\n\nSecondary structures differ from primary structure\nby not determining the \u201cglobal\u201d mechanical properties\nof the spacecraft as a whole. Rather they only govern\nthe local behavior of the on-board systems or pay-\nloads that are fastened onto them. Nevertheless, their\ngeometrical forms and sizes are such that they ought\nto be represented in the finite element model of the\nspacecraft in an identifiable manner, and their mecha-\nnical behavior ought to be explicitly analyzed. Only\nparts which are significantly smaller, such as compact\nboxes or cable clips, and which may be considered as\ntertiary structures, can be treated as \u201csmeared mass\u201d\nor as point mass. Deployable structures such as solar\npanels or booms are basically secondary structures.\n\n4.1.2.1 Instrument Fixtures and Insulation\n\nInstrument fixtures which can be regarded as se-\ncondary structures, due to either their size or their\nmechanical function (for instance, a nonnegligible\ncantilever beam), can be connected to the primary\nstructure by means of inserts and screws, as can\ntertiary structures (e.g., boxes or clamps). Alterna-\ntively they can be monolithically connected to the\nprimary structure, as shown in the example in Figure\n4.1.16. In the latter case they are in formal terms,\nthat is with respect to their labeling, a constituent\npart of the primary structure because they cannot\nbe dismounted.\n\nWhen fiber composite materials (preferably CFRP)\nare used, then such fixtures can easily and very preci-\nsely be aligned in the desired attitude and orientation,\nprovided that a 3D CNC-manufactured building slip\n(or mold) is available, in which is embedded not only\nthe primary structure, but also all interface planes\nand positions foreseen for the later attachment of the\nadjacent units.

Until just prior to launch,\nthat is until the fairing is set on top of the launcher, it\nis usual to protect each batch of stowed solar panels by\nan additional protective cover panel in order to avoid\naccidental damage of the solar cells (see the enlarged\ndisplay window in Figure 4.1.19).\n\nSolar panels consist of relatively lightweight sand-\nwich plates on which the solar cell arrays and the\ncorresponding harness are glued. Under the dynamic\nloading during launch their mechanical behavior\ndepends mainly on their firmly latching in the launch\nlocks (see Section 4.1.5.1). The spring-driven hinges\nbetween the individual panels can be regarded as \u201csoft\u201d\nand almost neglected from a structural mechanics\npoint of view.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nAs soon as the whole configuration has been de-\nployed in space, however, the situation is completely\ndifferent, particularly if there are three or more solar\npanels on each side (and not just two as in the above\nexample of Venus Express, which cruises relatively\nclose to the Sun). For instance, in the case of the Ro-\nsetta mission, which is bound for regions much more\ndistant from the Sun, five large solar panels arranged\none behind the other are needed on both sides of the\nspacecraft, achieving in all a \u201cwingspan\u201d of 32 m.\n\nEven very small accelerations generated by flight\nmaneuvers or minor disturbances can, under such\ncircumstances, induce low-frequency vibrations in\nthe order of 1 Hz. The stiffness (and correspondingly\nthe first eigenfrequencies) as well as the damping\nproperties of an unfolded solar panel configuration\nwith latched spring hinges need in any case to be tho-\nroughly analyzed. For the relevant analytical approach\nsee [4.1.27].\n\n4.1.2.3 Booms\n\nIn the context of space technology the term boom\nusually characterizes all kind of deployable cantilever\narms by means of which instruments, sensors, anten-\nnas, etc., are positioned in a defined attitude outside\nthe spacecraft.\n\nIf such a boom consists of rigid links with spring-\ndriven hinges in between, then its structural mecha-\nnics are basically the one-dimensional variant of the\nbatch of solar panels described above. The behavior\nof the stowed configuration during launch depends\nprimarily on the quality and the position of the launch\nlocks, while the dynamic behavior of the configuration\nin its unfolded state is determined by the mechanical\nproperties of the boom links themselves, by the mass\nof the deployed payload (e.g., a magnetometer) and\nby the stiffness of the hinges.\n\nOne particular challenge is booms for the dep-\nloyment of really large, ultralight structures such as\nsolar sails, huge antennas or reflectors, or even solar\ncell arrays which are no longer deployed in the con-\nventional manner by means of rigid elements, but\nby a flexible carrier which achieves its final contour\nonly after having been unfolded in space.

It was mandatory\nto stow these booms during the integration and launch\nphases in a very small stowage volume [4.1.28].\n\nAs depicted in Figure 4.1.20, each boom consists\nof two long, unrollable, very thin-walled curved CFRP\nshells, the half-circled profiles of which are the mirror\nimage of their respective counterpart. In the absence\nof external forces, these shells unfold under the influ-\nence of internal stresses that have been \u201cfrozen\u201d during\nhardening, and form a long tube with two sideward\nflanges. Such a tube can be compressed to a flat ribbon\nand rolled up on a spool like a tape measure. Upon\nunwinding, the stored deformation energy initiates the\nunfolding. By means of a suitable mechanism several\nbooms can be radially deployed out of a central body\nand simultaneously unfold a thin sail foil or another\nultralight device [4.1.29], [4.1.30], [4.1.31].\n\nSince these booms are very thin walled, their load-\nbearing capability depends primarily on their buckling\nstiffness, for which a laminate based on a combina-\ntion of 0\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 fiber layers is very advantageous.\nMoreover, this lay-up sequence helps to minimize the\ndeformation of the boom under unilateral thermal\nirradiation in space. Very low coefficients of thermal\nexpansion (CTEs) in the longitudinal direction are\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:217\n\n217\n\ndecisive. The specific weight of the boom is in the\norder of 100 g/m.\n\nThe dominating thermal effect on such booms is\nheat transfer by radiation, because their surface is huge\nin relation to their mass. Therefore future applications\nwill decisively depend on a suitable surface coating\nwhich is anyway necessary as a protective shield\nagainst degradation. The use of coated Kapton foil is\nalready proven, at least on shorter boom sections. Also,\nthe deployment concept as such was successfully tested\nin the course of a large-scale on-ground demonstra-\ntion in 1999, where a solar sail with four booms each\n14 m long was unfolded [4.1.30], [4.1.31].\n\n4.1.3 Structural Analysis\n\n4.1.3.1 Finite Element Models and Modal Models\n\nConsidering the complexity of spacecraft structures\nit is evident that their mechanical behavior cannot be\ncomprehensively and accurately described by analy-\ntical formulas alone. At best some global properties\ncan be approximately estimated by \u201chand calculations\u201d\n(which is anyhow valuable in Phase A studies).\n\nTherefore the structural mechanics calculations\nare today performed by means of the finite element\nmethod (FEM) as the state of the art in engineering\nsciences. Using the FEM means representing the real\nstructure by a discrete mathematical model which\nconsists of a large number of geometrically simple\nfinite elements that are connected to each other at\ndefined nodal points, thereby forming a mesh. In the\ncase of the simplest (linear) finite element types these\nnodes are identical to the corner points of the element.\nThe elements can be one, two or three dimensional.\nCorresponding to the mechanical properties assigned\nto them, they can be classified as rod elements, beam\nelements, shell elements, solid elements, and many\nother types.\n\nAny attempt to thoroughly describe here all these\nelements and the idealizations upon which they are\nbased would be far beyond the scope of this handbook.\nTherefore reference is made to the comprehensive\nliterature on this topic, in particular to the excellent\nmonograph by Bathe [4.1.32].

Thus it may not be necessary to model\nthe whole geometry of the structure from scratch.\nHowever, the designer\u2019s view is sometimes different\nfrom the view of the engineer responsible for the\nstructural analysis. For instance, a thin-walled shell\nstructure may be ideally represented in the FE model\nby shell elements, based on which the numerical ap-\nproach is two dimensional, namely superposition of\na plate-bending stiffness and a membrane stiffness.\nThe CAD designer, however, may prefer to work with\n\u201csolids,\u201d that is with volume elements, because the ge-\nneration of technical drawings and the manufacturing\nrequirements necessitate this approach. In any case the\nconversion of a CAD model into a FE model must be\nexamined very critically.\n\nIt is obvious that the accuracy achievable with\nFEM calculations depends on the mesh, that is on\nthe resolution of details by a number of elements.\nSince a very fine mesh leads to strongly increased\nmodeling and calculation effort, it is restricted to\nthe vicinity of critical interfaces, essential load paths\nand other important areas.

For dynamic analyses there are supplementary\nterms describing the inertial and damping properties.\nOf crucial importance are the boundary constraints\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:219\n\n219\n\nwhich define whether the structure is somewhere\nfixed, whether it can freely vibrate, or which other\nconditions may apply.\n\nBefore the FE model is actually used it is com-\nmonly subjected to a model verification. At first a\nso-called \u201cmass properties check\u201d is performed; that is,\nmass, CoG, and Mol with respect to the main axes of\ninertia are determined so that their plausibility can be\nchecked. In NASTRAN, for instance, the next steps are\na \u201crigid body check,\u201d a \u201cresidual strain energy check\u201d\nand a \u201cstatic load check.\u201d All these checks are basically\ntests for the self-consistency of the model.\n\nApart from the FEM there are in principle other\n\ndiscrete mathematical modeling methods, in parti-\ncular the finite difference method (FDM) and the\nboundary element method (BEM) [4.1.33]. For\nthe purposes of structural mechanics, however, they\nare less suitable than the FEM. The FDM is very ap-\nplicable for the calculation of transient temperature\ndistributions, and for this function it is also established\nin space technology (see Section 4.3). The BEM is\nadvantageous for some special problems, for instance\nthe determination of stress concentrations on crack\ntips or notch tips.\nThe above-mentioned FE models are also defined\nas physical FE models because they represent (with\nmore or less accuracy) the real physical configuration\nof the structure. However, if the structure is to be\nintegrated into a superior unit, then the details of its\nbehavior are meaningless for the structural analysis\nof the larger unit. Of interest is only how the imple-\nmented small unit as a whole acts on the interfaces to\nthe larger superior unit.\n\nFor static analyses the physical FE model of the\nembedded unit can be replaced by a reduced stiff-\nness matrix. For dynamic analyses it is then suffici-\nent to determine the global \u201cresponse function\u201d of\nthe embedded component under a given excitation.\nThe respective models are called modal models. They\nare derived from the physical FE model by special\nmethods such as the Craig-Bampton method.\n\nResponsibility for generation of the FE model\nand for the numerical analyses performed with it is\nusually assigned to the subsystem \u201cstructure\u201d (i.e., to\nthe institution or company in charge of providing the\nstructure), even though the FE model always depicts\nthe spacecraft as a whole.\n\n2/24/09 3:39:34 PM\n",

Then it\nmust be verified that the first global eigenfrequencies\nlie beyond a specified limit (for instance, 100 Hz) in\norder to exclude critical resonances between the exci-\ntations generated by the rocket engines and the space-\ncraft.

If, on the other hand, only a few percent\nof the modal mass participate in a vibration mode,\nthen this mode is \u201clocal\u201d and in most cases induced\nby some identifiable subunit. The relative amount of\ninvolved modal mass is determined automatically by\nthe FE program.\n\nThe real spectral response functions of the struc-\nture, or of the whole, fully integrated spacecraft, are\nrepeatedly determined in the course of the structural\ntests within the AIV program. Their experimental\ndetermination is achieved by low-level sine vibration\ntests that are performed before, between and after\nall qualification tests under higher loads, in order to\nverify the enduring integrity of the spacecraft (see\nSection 4.1.4). These results are used to adapt the FE\nmodel to reality. The model parameters are iteratively\nmodified until the results gained with the FE model\ncorrespond exactly to the experimental ones (model\nupdating).\n\n4.1.3.3 Strength Proof and Margins of Safety\n\nAfter the analysis of eigenfrequencies and eigen-\nmodes, the strength proof of the structure becomes\nthe focal point of the calculations. For all structural\ncomponents and all relevant connections and inter-\nfaces (inserts, struts, etc.) it has to be proven that the\ncalculated allowable loads at the respective location\nare higher than the maximum forces which may occur\nwith the given design, where these \u201cdesign loads\u201d are\nstill to be multiplied by one or more safety factors\n(see Table 4.1.2).\n\nConsequently, the defined ratio should be greater\nthan one. But since a change of sign appears even\nmore striking than does the fluctuation of a number\naround one, the so-called margin of safety (MoS) is\npragmatically defined as\n\nallowable load _\ndesign load x safety factors\n\nMoS =\n\nThis value is determined for all relevant joints and\ninterfaces on the structure, in particular for all inserts\nonto which assembly parts of nonnegligible size and\nmass are fastened. If the MoS value becomes nega-\ntive this is immediately obvious so that corrective\nmeasures can be initiated.\n\n2/27/09 12:52:51 AM\n",

In particular, the fixations of\na spacecraft structure on a superior unit, for instance\nthe interface between satellite and launch adapter,\nsubsatellite and main satellite, lander and orbiter, etc.,\nbelong to this category.\n\nIn these cases it is not sufficient to rely on a very\nfine mesh alone, nor is it admissible to simply presu-\nme a completely rigid connection. Rather, a spring\nconstant must be introduced which cannot be reliably\nvalidated until the structural tests have been evalua-\nted (Figure 4.1.24). Only an empirical comparison\nof the movements of the spacecraft and the rigid\nbody movements of its base mounted on the shaker\ntable, which are measured by special accelerometers\n(so-called \u201cpilots\u201d), gives evidence of these model\nparameters. Therefore, it is essential to perform the\nstructural tests with a realistic carrier structure simi-\nlar to the real flight configuration and not to rigidly\nfasten the spacecraft structure onto the shaker table\nitself (Figure 4.1.25).\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:221\n\nSeparation line\n\nSpring element\n\nInterface node\n\nN\\\n\nRBE2 elements\n\nFigure 4.1.24: FE modeling of the interface nodes between Rosetta\norbiter and lander.\n\nThe same is true for lids and locks on the structure\nitself which have a firm abutment on one side, but are\nheld toward the other side only by a down-holding\nmechanism.

The reason is obvious: if the qua-\nlification is not successful, then the need may arise to\nredesign the whole configuration from scratch, with\nserious consequences for the development schedule\nand costs, and also for the other subsystems and the\npayload. Compared to the structure, it is much easier\nto isolate and finally overcome the consequences of\nany design errors or weak points in other subsystems,\nfor instance in the electronic ones, probably by \u201cdelta\nqualifications.\u201d\n\nThe qualification is normally performed by means\nof the structural-thermal model (STM), the first of\nthe \u201cofficial\u201d qualification models, in most cases at the\nbeginning of Phase C/D. An STM is already completely\nsubject to the whole set of configuration control rules,\nother than any proceeding breadboard models.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\ng, 10 Notching in\nfs Zdirection |\n\"Intermediate levels\" y\n\nZEEE im\n\n[ \"Low level sine tests\" between all tests\nwith higher loads (also random tests)\n\n4\n\n0 50 Hz 100\nFrequency\n\nAcceleration\n\nFigure 4.1.26: Load levels in structural tests.\n\nThe STM must represent the spacecraft in the\nfully integrated state; that is, all units on-board must\nbe represented by models (\u201cmass dummies\u201d) which\nare realistic with respect to their mass, CoG, Mol,\nexternal geometry, surface properties and mechani-\ncal interfaces. (For the thermal tests also their heat\nexchange with the environment must be simulated\nrealistically.)\n\nFigure 4.1.26 demonstrates the test philosophy, ta-\nking the sine vibration tests as an example. The STM is\nseparately tested in each of the three directions (x, y, z).\nAt first a so-called low-level sine test with a very low\nexcitation amplitude (probably 0.5g) is performed. In\nthis test the frequency is slowly (e.g., at 2 octaves per\nminute) swept from almost zero up to 2000 Hz, so that\nthe resonance curve can be determined. Subsequently\nthe excitation amplitude is stepwise increased up\nto the qualification level (Q-level); however, these\nreal loading test runs are usually limited to frequencies\nup to 100 Hz.\n\nBetween all these intermediate-level or Q-level\nload tests, low-level sine tests are repeatedly perfor-\nmed in order to verify the enduring integrity of the\nstructure. A frequency shift of the resonance peaks\nbetween two low-level sine test curves recorded prior\nto and after a \u201creal load\u201d test would indicate internal\ndamage, that is a progressing \u201csoftness\u201d of the struc-\nture. The frequency response curve (resonance curve)\nmeasured in the final low-level sine test for each axis\nthen serves as the basis for the model updating of the\nFE model.\n\nFor sine load tests the required excitation ampli-\ntudes in the directions of all three axes are predefined\n\n2/24/09 3:39:36 PM\n",
    "244": "4.1 Structure and Mechanisms\n\nas effective values (root mean square, RMS) versus\nfrequency with the acceleration of gravity as the unit,\nthat is in gps (see Figure 4.1.26). Quasi-static loads\nare measured in multiples of gas well.\n\nFora random load and acoustic load the required\nexcitation in each axis is predefined as a power spec-\ntral density (PSD), which is pragmatically measured\nin g/Hz. The same approach is used for shock loads\n[4.1.34]. At least the random load tests are accompa-\nnied by preceding and succeeding low-level sine tests,\nas described above.\n\nIn case of critical resonance magnifications it is\nallowed under certain circumstances to reduce the\nexcitation amplitude on the Q-level in limited fre-\nquency intervals. The originally prescribed accelerati-\non curve (scaled in gversus Hz) or PSD curve (scaled\nin g/Hz versus Hz) then gets a notch. Therefore,\nthis procedure is quite pictorially called notching. It\nneeds to be formally approved in each individual case\nby a \u201cTest Review Board\u201d appointed by the project\nmanagement.\n\nThe Q-level is usually 1.5 times higher than the\nso-called acceptance level (A-level), which still covers\nsufficiently safely the dynamic loads that can be really\nexpected during launch.\n\nOther than the STM, the flight model (FM) is\nonly tested on the A-level, but apart from that, the\ntest procedures for the FM are the same. The FM is\nmounted on the shaker table in all three axis direc-\ntions (x, y, z) one after another (see Figure 4.1.25)\nand tested under the prescribed sine and random\nloads, repeatedly, with low-level sine tests in between.\nAcoustic tests and shock tests are optional, depending\non the specific project requirements. For the FM they\nare often omitted in practice.\n\n4.1.5 Mechanisms\n\nThe following considerations are confined to mecha-\nnisms which are directly connected with the structural\nmechanics of the spacecraft, for instance by serving to\nseparate different segments from each other, to lock\nand unlock, or to deploy and actively position subs-\ntantial spacecraft parts. Mechanisms in the interior of\npayloads (e.g., inside scientific instruments), however,\nare not considered here.\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:223\n\n223\n\nA basic requirement for spaceborne mechanisms\nis high autonomy or reliable functioning without\nany human assistance. Only in exceptional cases, for\ninstance on the International Space Station (ISS) or\non-board the Space Shuttle, astronauts are present\nwho could help a jamming mechanism along. In most\nother cases, however, there is no chance to intervene,\nand a failing mechanism can well be hazardous for\nthe whole mission.\n\nWhile for many mechanisms designed for nonre-\ncurring use the holding time from launch to release\nis short (minutes, hours, or a couple of days at the\nmost), tilting or positioning drives must often remain\ncontinuously operable under space conditions for\nmany years. In the case of extraterrestrial missions the\ncriterion of long-term reliability is also mandatory for\nseparation, unlocking and spring mechanisms, which\nmust immediately function at the target of the missi-\non even after a long cruise flight and under extreme\nenvironmental conditions.\n\n4.1.5.1 Pyromechanisms\n\nPyromechanical separation mechanisms serve for\nthe fast and reliable separation of different spacecraft\nsegments from each other, or for the transection of\ncables and ropes. In the case of rigid connections they\nare referred to as pyrobolts, while for the transection\nof cables and ropes the terms cablecutter or pyroknife\nare customary. All of them are sometimes summarized\nby the term ordnance devices.\n\nThe constructive diversity of such mechanisms,\nwhich are commercially available, is rather large. In all\ncases a small explosive charge is ignited in a reaction\nchamber so that the explosion pressure can act via a\npiston (or the equivalent of a piston) ona cutting tool,\nby which a rigid bolt or a cable can be transected.\n\n\u2018Since an explosive charge generates very large\nforces or pressures, the mechanism can be quite small\nfor most applications in space technology. The largest\npyrobolts are generally needed to separate the different\nstages of the launcher.\n\nFor the latter purpose also the second characteris-\ntic of pyrobolts (apart from the high forces released)\nbecomes decisive, namely the short duration of the\nreaction. Rocket stages must be separated in one fell\nswoop, and if they are connected by several pyrobolts\n\n2/24/09 3:39:42 PM\n",

This synchrony is\nonly realistically feasible by means of pyromechanical\ndevices.\n\nUpon ignition shock waves in the structure are\ninevitably generated which, in the frequency range\nof several kilohertz, can reach an amplitude of several\nthousand g. Typical of the \u201cfar field\u201d at some distance\nfrom the pyrodevice is a rise in amplitude up to a\n\u201cknee frequency\u201d of approximately 5 kHz with a sub-\nsequent amplitude decay [4.1.34]. Within the analysis\nand qualification of the spacecraft these shock waves\nmust necessarily be considered. In particular, sensitive\ninstruments can easily be damaged by shock waves and\nmay need a damping bearing [4.1.35].\n\nFigure 4.1.27 shows the deployment concept of an\nairbag designed for the landing on Mars (NetLander\nproject [4.1.20]). The concept was derived from a\nprevious development of the Babakin Company for\nthe Russian Mars-96 mission and was based solely on\npyromechanical devices.\n\nBoth calottes of the airbag which surround the\nlanding probe are laced up to a single sphere. Af-\nter transection of the parachute line by means of a\npyroknife on the upper side and touchdown on the\nMartian surface, a pyrobolt releases all the ropes\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nsurrounding the sphere in one fell swoop, which initi-\nates the immediate bellying of the calottes. The subse-\nquent pyromechanical transection of ropes and straps\nin the interior, which circumferentially surround the\nlanding probe, accomplishes the landing process.\n\nApart from separation mechanisms in the lite-\nral sense, there are also pyromechanical unlocking\nmechanisms, in particular pinpullers, since a large\nportion of all launch locks of panels, booms, anten-\nnas, etc., is based on pins which hold a spring-driven\nor motor-driven deployment mechanism by form-\nlocking contact. Here it is decisive to pull the locking\npin reliably and without jamming of its counter-bea-\nring so that the deployment can occur unimpeded.\n\nIf the unlocking must occur at several locations\nsynchronously, then pyromechanically driven pinpul-\nlers are often preferred in order to avoid having the\ndeploying structure free on one side while it is still\nlocked on the other side, which might lead to jamming\nor hazardous dangling movements.\n\nThe external shape of pyromechanical pinpullers\nis in most cases quite similar to that of pinpullers\nwith a nonexplosive drive (Figure 4.1.28). The reac-\ntion takes place in a cylindrical chamber, after which\na bolt is abruptly pulled behind or pressed out of a\nflange plate.\n\nAll pyromechanical devices are subject to par-\nticular safety regulations and may be armed only\nimmediately prior to launch. On satellites and space\nprobes it is often only allowed to install them in this\nphase, replacing the nonhazardous placeholders. In\nany case they require special access conditions.\n\nFigure 4.1.28: Pinpuller (schematic).\n\n2/25/09 12:28:13 PM\n",

Similar to\npyromechanically driven devices but much slower, a\nchemical reaction is ignited in their reaction chamber,\nor a phase transition is initiated, which pressurizes a\npiston or something equivalent. By means of this pres-\nsure, bolts or ropes can be transected, but also locking\npins can be pulled. Shock loads are avoided.\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:225\n\n225\n\nFor instance, the four separation adapters of the\nRosetta lander schematically depicted in Figure 4.1.24\nwere so-called nonexplosive actuators (NEAs) which\nhad to transect screw connections with M9 thread.\nThe transection was performed shortly after launch in\norder to avoid the risk of thermoelastic stresses which\ncould, after 10 years of cruise flight in space, possibly\nlead to jamming. Nevertheless this transection of the\nfour main load paths between orbiter and lander was\nnot the same as an immediate physical separation.\nBoth spacecraft units remained connected to each\nother by a light holding mechanism (cruise latch).\n\nOne of the most reliable types of pinpullers with\na nonexplosive drive is the so-called wax motor (see\nFigure 4.1.29). A cylindrical chamber contains solid\nparaffin in which a heating element is embedded,\nmostly a PTC thermistor, optionally in duplicate. Upon\nmelting, the paraffin expands and presses with a high\nforce against a piston which acts in turn on the actuator\npin. Depending on the construction, the pin can be eit-\nher retracted or pushed forward. Suitable mechanical\ndeflections allow for all kinds of unlocking movements.\nOf course there are also electromagnetically driven\npinpullers. However, with respect to the generated\nforce in relation to the required electric current, the\nsize, and safety against jamming, wax motors are clearly\nsuperior as long as the velocity is uncritical.\n\nPinpullers and other types of launch locks are to-\nday commercial available as commercial off the shelf\n(COTS) products in a broad variety of forms, and\nneed no longer be developed for a specific mission.\n\n4.1.5.3 Spring Mechanisms\n\nThe above-mentioned pinpullers are very often symbi-\notically connected to spring mechanisms, where they\nunlock a prestressed compression spring or torsion\nspring and thus permit deployment of the attached\nunit (boom, panel, antenna, etc.).\n\nThe torsion-spring-driven hinge depicted in\nFigure 4.1.30 is a typical example. It was developed by\nthe Pfeil Trawid Company [4.1.36] for a Mars landing\nprobe (NetLander project [4.1.20]), for the deployment\nof its solar array petals that were stacked upon each\nother. The torsion spring has a diameter of 21.8 mm,\na length of 32 mm and generates a maximum torque\nof 2.1 N m. The whole hinge weighs 68 g.\n\n2/24/09 3:39:43 PM\n",
    "247": "CHO04.indd Sec1:226\n\n226\n\nFigure 4.1.31: Internal view of the torsion-spring-driven hinge.\n\nSince the moved component (in this example\nthe unfolding solar array petal that is fastened on\nthe upper flange) is accelerated during the rotational\nmovement of the spring, it could hit the stopper with\nmaximum velocity, that is with maximum angular\nmomentum, which would result in strong oscillations,\nprobably even damage. Therefore the torsion-spring-\ndriven hinge contains in its interior a torsional brake\nwhich becomes progressively effective with increasing\nopening angle.\n\nAs shown in the exploded view (Figure 4.1.31) the\nopening of the torsion spring is accompanied by the\nco-rotation of a cam-guided cylinder in a guiding slee-\nve which compresses a Belleville spring washer such\nthat the rotational movement is effectively damped\nuntil the final position (latching position) is reached.\nSpring hinges of this type are well proven in space\ntechnology.\n\nSince in many applications several similar deploy-\nment steps must be taken consecutively (for instance,\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nin the case of sequential unfolding of solar panels) the\nspring mechanisms and their unlocking devices must\nbe effectively switchable in series.\nIf the moving parts are somewhat distant from\neach other then each individual spring-driven hinge\nwill be released by a pinpuller (driven pyromecha-\nnically, electromagnetically or by a wax motor) and\nthe individual steps of the release sequence will be\ncontrolled electrically. For instance, upon complete\nunfolding of a panel or boom link, the unlocking of\nthe next one can be triggered by an end switch.\nIf the moving parts are in close contact, then the\ncontrol can also be purely mechanical. In the above-\nmentioned example of the sequential radial deploy-\nment of the solar array petals of a small Mars landing\nprobe, each petal bears a spigot on the inner side of\nthe flange of the torsion-spring-driven hinge which\nlocks the subjacent petal in the stowed configuration.\nAs soon as the hinge has opened up to a certain angle,\nthe subjacent petal is released (Figure 4.1.32).\nSpring-driven hinges can also be combined with\nelectrical hinge drives. The stack of solar array petals\ndeveloped for the above-mentioned NetLander pro-\nject was covered by a much more massive outer lid\nwhich served not only as solar array carrier, but also\n\nas bearing area for a possibly necessary uprighting\nmovement (see Figure 4.1.11). The hinge drive for\nthis outer lid had of course to be electrical, because\nthe necessary uprighting torque was 25 times higher\nthan the torque required for the lid opening only.\nHowever, the latter case was the nominal one, because\nthe nominal landing attitude was upright.\n\nIn order not to make mission success in the no-\nminal case (upright position) conditional on the\nfunctioning of the motor-driven hinge (i.e., to avoid\na so-called single point failure) the hinge axis was\nadditionally equipped with a torsion spring drive\nwhich could at least open the lid in the case of a motor\nfailure (see Figure 4.1.33).\n\n4.1.5.4 Electric Motors and Drives\n\nFigure 4.1.33 shows exemplarily the above-described\ncombination of a motor-driven and a spring-driven\nhinge [4.1.36], see also Figure 4.1.11.

The input\nvariables of a tribosystem are load and speed, while\nfriction and wear are the output variables. A simplified\nversion of the laws of friction is stated below:\n\n1. The friction is proportional to the normal force.\nThe relationship between frictional force Fp and\nnormal force Fy defines a friction coefficient p\n(Fp =H Fy).\n\n2. The frictional force is independent of the size of\nthe contact surface.\n\n3. The frictional force is independent of the speed.\n\nFriction is generated by adhesion and abrasion\nbetween the surfaces involved, and is influenced by\ntheir hardness, elasticity and roughness. The above\nformulated laws of friction are a simplification valid\nunder the assumption that both the measuring peri-\nods and the scales are sufficiently large. If short-term\nphenomena (occurring in milli-, micro- or nanose-\nconds) or measurements in the micro- or nanometer\nrange are considered, then the validity of these laws is\nlimited. This is known as the scale dependency of the\nlaws of friction. Deviations are also observed under\nvacuum conditions, where the friction coefficient\nmay drastically increase or fluctuate, while under\natmospheric conditions the surface is always covered\nby a protective oxide and adsorption layer, which also\nregulates the friction process. Tribological materials\nshould not just have a low friction coefficient, rather\nalso the fluctuations of this coefficient across the life\nspan of the system should be low. Drives need to be\ndesigned for the maximal frictional resistance occur-\nring, so that a permanently low friction coefficient\nmakes it possible to build weight-saving drives. The\nindependence of the friction from speed does not\nexist for fluids where the internal friction increases\nwith speed. Therefore, tribosystems which are lubri-\ncated with liquid lubricants have a speed-dependent\nfriction.\n\nApart from friction, wear is the second important\nparameter for the description of a tribological system.\nLike friction, wear can be caused by adhesion and\nabrasion, but also other forms, such as wear caused\nby fatigue, erosion or tribochemical reactions, are\nknown. Both wear and friction are system properties\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:231\n\n231\n\nwhich can be disproportionately influenced by the\nvariation of other system properties. Generally, wear\nincreases with load, is proportional to the wearing\ndistance, and decreases with growing hardness of\nthe surfaces involved. In addition to the material and\ngeometrical characteristics of the friction partners,\nthe lubricant is another important design element\nthat influences friction and wear. For tribosystems\nin space technology it is mandatory to retest them\nafter every modification of the construction or of the\noperational conditions, because the complexity even\nof simple tribosystems is still too high to accurately\npredict friction and wear effects under space condi-\ntions with today\u2019s calculation tools.\n\nTribological systems in space technology are a\nfocal point of engineering research, because there are\ncertain particularities compared to terrestrial tribo-\nsystems, for instance the operation in high vacuum,\nthe influence of large temperature gradients and of\nradiation, and the vibrational launch loads. While the\nenvironmental pressure in the geostationary orbit lies\nat 10\u00b0? mbar, this value may grow in the close vicinity\nof a satellite to approximately 107'\u00b0 mbar due to the\noutgassing of materials. Therefore space materials\nmust be qualified for use in a vacuum; that is, they\nmust have an outgassing rate as low as possible and be\nas resistant as possible against degradation by radia-\ntion or highly energetic particles (see Section 4.1.1.4\nabove). While metals usually satisfy these criteria,\nthe use of polymers is more critical since monomers\nand additives can easily escape. This is also the case\nfor any lubricants used. Either dry lubricants or high\nmolecular liquids with limited vaporization should\ntherefore be used.\n\nWhen the spacecraft rotates, or when it passes\nthrough an eclipse, temperature differences of up to\n100 K can easily occur. This has to be considered not\nonly with respect to the design of mechanisms and\nbearings, but also for the selection of an adequate\nliquid lubricant, because liquids are strongly affected\nby large temperature gradients. Oil-based lubricants\nharden under low temperatures, whereas high tem-\nperatures accelerate the evaporation process, which\ncan lead to a drying up of the lubricant. Certainly the\ninfluence of vacuum and temperature on the friction\nresistance can be investigated by thermal vacuum tests\n(TV tests), but long-term prediction of the frictional\n\n2/24/09 3:40:03 PM\n",

Therefore the trend is\nto control the climatic conditions for liquid lubricated\nsystems, such as bearings and momentum wheels, by\nsuitable sealing.\n\nMechanical loads in orbit are usually lower than on\nthe ground due to the absence of gravity. Nevertheless,\nbearings are subject to inertia forces when the me-\nchanism is accelerated, and optionally to prestresses\nwhich may have been applied in order to protect the\nassembly parts during the launch phase. Otherwise\nthe vibrations during launch may lead to damage\n\n(\u201cbrinelling\u201d) when neigh\n\nboring surfaces impact each\n\nother, an effect which is particularly critical for rolling\nbearings. A resolution of this issue is to apply elastic\n\nprestresses or to use dam\n\nAs for terrestrial app\u2019\ncontact or bearing princi\nto the dimensioning of\n\ning elements.\n\nications, the choice of the\niple has to be made prior\na space mechanism. The\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:232\n\nfundamental distinction is between sliding bearings\nand rolling bearings. While simple, slowly moving or\nseldom/single-use mechanisms are usually equipped\nwith sliding bearings, rolling bearings are preferred\nfor permanently moving units. Accordingly, the hinges\nused for the deployment of solar array panels are\nequipped with sliding bearings, while for instance the\ndrives in the solar array drive mechanisms (SADM, or\nBAPTA, respectively, see Section. 4.1.2.2) have rolling\nbearings, as well as gyros for energy storage or attitude\nstabilization.\n\nSuitable materials for tribologically stressed as-\nsembly parts are selected metals, polymers, compo-\nsites and ceramics. Since their qualification requires\nconsiderable effort it is preferable to use already\nwell-known and proven materials, for instance har-\ndened steels such as AISI 52100 (100Cr6) or AISI\n440C (102CrMo17). AISI 440C is a corrosion-resis-\ntant aerospace steel which, depending on its thermal\ntreatment, covers a temperature range from \u2014270 to\n+300 \u00b0C. Also, innovative nitrogen-alloyed steels such\nas X30CrMoN15.1 are used, which are quite resistant\nto wear effects in rolling bearing contacts and already\nproven in aerospace applications. Steels excel in their\nstrength, ductility, hardness and ease of processing,\nwhile their disadvantage is their relatively high weight.\nAluminum and titanium alloys are lighter but, due to\ntheir low hardness, suitable only for tribological pur-\nposes if the surface has a protective layer against wear.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nThis is particularly true for titanium, which shows a\nbroad scatter of the friction coefficient under vacuum\nconditions and easily tends to cold-welding. Tribolo-\ngically used assembly parts made from titanium are\neither lubricated or coated.\n\nSoft-metal alloys, like bronze or brass, are used\nfor the cages of rolling bearings. In order to minimize\nwear of such soft metals a protective layer of titanium\ncarbide (TiC), titanium nitrite (TiN), tungsten car-\nbide (WC), diamond-like carbon (DLC) or tungsten\ncarbide/carbon (WC/C) can be used. Such layers are\napplied by PVD- or CVD-coating methods. Copper\nalloys (bronze, brass) are also used for sliding com-\nponents which can be coated with soft-metal layers\n(silver, lead). An overview of the tribological materials\nand selection strategies used in space technology can\nbe found in [4.1.44] and [4.1.46].\n\n4.1.5.7 Lubrication of Bearings and Mechanisms\n\nIn space there is a high risk of unintentional welding\nbetween metallic surfaces because, other than in an\natmosphere containing oxygen, there is no protective\noxide layer, and also because impacting high-energy\nparticles support the generation of local interatomic\nbonds. It is accordingly important to separate the\nsurfaces with lubricants or layering systems. Basically,\none can distinguish between dry lubricants and liquid\nlubricants. Liquids create a lubricating film between\nthe contact partners which regulates itself according to\nspeed, viscosity and mechanical load. The minimum\nthickness of this film depends on the roughness of\nthe surface. For metallic and ceramic surfaces the\nmean value of roughness is usually between 0.02 and\n0.1 ym. In principle the surface should be as smooth as\npossible; however, it is observed that for roughnesses\nsmaller than 0.05 xm the quality of the lubricating\nfilm can deteriorate. Lubricants where the viscosity\nincreases under high pressure are known as shear thin-\nning lubricants; they facilitate the separation of the\nsurfaces even in highly stressed rolling bearings. The\nload in rolling bearings is transmitted across a very\nsmall surface of only a few square millimeters. The\nmaximum compression occurring in the contact zone\nis known as Hertzian stress and reaches values up to\n4000 N/mm2. Rolling bearings are usually operated in\na range of 2000-3000 N/mm2. Under these conditions\n\n2/24/09 3:40:03 PM\n",

Suitable algorithms\nand computer programs for selecting an appropriate\nlubricant and calculating the required viscosity are\navailable; see [4.1.42] and [4.1.46].\n\nThe characteristic behavior of the friction coeffici-\nent asa function of the (rotational) speed under con-\nstant load and viscosity can be described by a Stribeck\ncurve (Figure 4.1.40). For liquid lubrication one can\ndistinguish between dry friction (boundary lubrica-\ntion), mixed friction and the range of the completely\nseparating lubricating film (hydrodynamic lubrica-\ntion). For many friction partners the transition from\nresting state to movement is coupled with a sudden\ndecrease in friction. The force necessary to overcome\nthe resting state is known as static friction.\n\nDry lubricants are always used in the range of\ndry friction, where the difference between static and\nsliding friction must be as small as possible. Bearings\noperated in the range of hydrodynamic lubrication\nare practically free of wear. Nevertheless, due to aging\nprocesses in the lubricant itself, the life span of a fully\nlubricated bearing is limited; however, the estimation\nof a lubricant\u2019s durability is difficult. Durability tests\non lubricants are time consuming and sophisticated.\nThe possibilities for quick tests are very limited since\nthe operating conditions strongly affect aging.\n\nTable 4.1.4 compares the essential characteristics\nof dry and liquid lubricants; more detailed infor-\nmation can be found in [4.1.46].

Their estimated\nlife span can be determined by short-term tests and\ndepends in particular on the acting load and the wear-\ning distance. Typical dry lubricants used to improve\nfriction behavior are soft-metal layers of silver, lead\nor gold, or layers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS,),\npolytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) or graphite. Layers of\nmetal can be applied galvanically or by physical vapor\ndeposition (PVD) coating [4.1.47].\n\nDry lubricants such as MoS, can also be applied\nby PVD. This is a sputtering process where solid ma-\nterial is evaporated and accelerated in the direction of\nthe substrate. The material condenses on the surface\nand forms a cohesive layer. Actively lubricating MoS,\nlayers have a thickness of only a few micrometers.\nLike graphite, MoS, has a lamellar structure. Under\ncompression the MoS, lamellae align in parallel and\nglide on each other, an effect which is observed in\nvacuum as well as under atmospheric conditions.\nHowever, under atmospheric conditions the friction\ncoefficient is several times larger than in vacuum, and\nthe wear increases accordingly. Tests on MoS,-coated\nassembly parts are thus carried out under inert gas\natmospheres (e.g., with nitrogen). An opposite effect\ncan be observed with dry lubricants on a graphite base\nwhere the friction coefficient decreases in the presence\nof humidity. MoS, is therefore one of the most fre-\nquently used dry lubricants in space technology.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:04 PM\n",

It can be used for\nboth rolling bearings and sliding contacts. Particularly\nfor rolling bearings with MoS,-coated runways it is\nmandatory to check their friction coefficient by initial\ntests before they are finally installed. It takes some time\nbefore the MoS, lamellae are aligned under load and\nthe friction reaches its minimum value, which is then\nmaintained throughout the life span of the lubricant\nlayer. The life span of an MoS, layer is limited by ab-\nrasive wear. Bearings with an MoS, coating are often\nequipped with cages which allow for dry lubrication\nas well (e.g., made of PTFE).\n\nPolymers suited for dry lubrication can be uti-\nlized for sliding contacts. PTFE is frequently used\nand can be reinforced optionally with glass fibers;\nin some cases it contains an admixture of MoS,. The\nlow friction of PTFE-lubricated components can be\nexplained by the transfer of a small amount of PTFE\nonto the opponent body (transfer lubrication). In a\nvacuum the friction coefficient remains practically\ninvariant. Contrary to most other dry lubricants,\nPTFE has a static friction coefficient which is equal\nto the sliding friction coefficient. PTFE is therefore\nparticularly suitable for moderately loaded, slowly\nmoving mechanisms requiring low initial friction. It\ncan be used for temperatures up to 280 \u00b0C and the\ncompressive load should not exceed 800 N/mm?. Are-\nas of application include sliding bearings and hinges,\nbut also rolling bearing cages because the latter are\nalso subject to sliding strain. Apart from PTFE, poly-\nimides are also used, in particular for highly stressed\ncomponents, but their sliding properties are worse\nthan those of PTFE. Polyamides, on the other hand,\nare used only rarely. Polymers are used in most cases\nwithout any additional coating; however, their load-\nbearing capability is significantly lower than that of\nmetallic materials.\n\nCurrent investigations are not only focused on an\nimproved separation of the surfaces by means of dry\nlubricants, but also focused on material pairings based\non different material classes, which helps to minimize\nadhesive wear. Pairings of ceramics and metals as well\nas of ceramics and polymers are particularly suited.\nBearings composed of steel rings and ceramic rolling\nelements are called hybrid bearings (Figure 4.1.41).\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFigure 4.1.41: Hybrid angular ball bearing with silver coating for\ndry operation (Source: CEROBEAR GmbH).\n\nThey can be operated with extremely small amounts\nof lubricant, and some of them can also operate in\nlow-viscous media. Investigations on completely\ndry running bearings in a vacuum have proven that\nunder certain circumstances hybrid bearings can\noperate even without any lubrication. In these cases\nthe rolling elements are made of silicon nitride (Si;N,)\nor zirconium oxide (ZrO,). In the case of the Space\nShuttle, for instance, the replacement of steel bearings\nin the turbopumps of the main engine by hybrid be-\narings has increased the life span of these bearings by\na factor of 60. In this application the only lubricating\nmedium is the propellant itself; that is, the bearings\nare operated in cryogenic liquid hydrogen at \u2014253 \u00b0C.\nResearch and development work focused on hybrid\nbearings in space mechanisms is ongoing.\n\nLiquid lubricants are still indispensable for ap-\nplications where high reliability and durability are\nrequired and the speed is high. The design of the\nappropriate bearings is aimed at operation in the\nhydrodynamic (thick-film) lubrication range, for\nwhich the bearing size and geometry, load, rotational\nspeed and lubrication need to be harmonized.

The electrical\npower system (EPS) of a spacecraft comprises\npower conversion, power conditioning, energy storage,\novervoltage and overcurrent protection, and power\ndistribution to the various users via the on-board\nlow-voltage power distribution systems. A spacecraft\u2019s\npower system provides power levels ranging from a\nfew watts up to the 50kW currently distributed at\nvoltages between 20 and 125V. The completely inte-\ngrated International Space Station (ISS) with 110kW\nrepresents an exceptional power demand.\n\nHigh-voltage technologies on spacecraft are\nincreasingly used for the power supply of electrical\npropulsion systems.\n\nThe EPS has to maintain the energy supply of con-\nnected users during all mission phases and under all\nthe environmental constraints encountered in space\nin a secure and maintenance-free manner.\n\nAn important requirement, at least for unmanned\nspace vehicles, is that the EPS autonomously maintains\nthe spacecraft power supply in all possible failure\nconditions, without operational intervention from\nthe ground. A power failure causes in almost all cases\nthe irreversible total loss of the spacecraft. Recovery\nof the spacecraft and a return to nominal operation\n\n2/24/09 3:40:11 PM\n",

Two basic methods have to be\n\ndistinguished:\n\n1. Energy is derived from the outside environment (so\nfar only in the form of converted solar energy).\n\n2. An energy source is carried on-board.\n\nThe conversion of the primary energy into\nelectrical energy is performed either directly by us-\ning the photovoltaic effect of solar cells as well as\nchemical-electrical conversion in galvanic elements\n(batteries or fuel cells), or indirectly by conversion of\nsolar or nuclear energy into thermal energy. Conver-\nsion of thermal energy into electrical energy can be\nachieved statically by using thermal or thermionic\nelements. A third method is dynamic conversion via\nkinetic energy using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\ngenerators or turboelectric thermal power machines\nwith gas (Brayton cycle or Stirling motor) and steam\nturbines (Rankine cycle).\n\nAlthough their efficiency is low, all nuclear energy\nsources flown so far use thermoelectric converters\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:237\n\nbecause of their operational reliability and simple\nhandling.\n\nA solar dynamic system converting solar energy\ninto thermal energy represents a combination of\nconverter and energy source. Although such systems\nhave an efficient surface-to-power ratio (ie., generated\nenergy per illuminated surface unit) the development\nof this method has so far not been pursued because\nof considerable efficiency improvements in solar cells\ncombined with their economical production costs.\n\n4.2.2 Power Sources\n\nSpace missions usually require power sources able\nto generate electrical power for many orbit cycles to\nsupply electrical loads and recharge batteries. While\nlaunch vehicles use primary batteries for power\nsupply because they usually have to provide power\nfor less than 1 hour (and at most up to 4hours), such\nan approach is not suitable for operating a spacecraft\nover a period of weeks, months or years because the\nenergy content of batteries alone would be insufficient.\nFigure 4.2.2 summarizes possible power sources.\n\nFuture lunar or planetary bases as well as\nlong-term missions will require either extremely\npowerful or regenerative energy systems since their\npower requirements will be far beyond the capabil-\nity of today\u2019s power systems like the ISS\u2019s current\nrequirement of 110kW.\n\nThe Sun (electromagnetic solar radiation, solar\ncorpuscular radiation), interplanetary space (inter-\nplanetary magnetic field, cosmic radiation) and the\nplanets (chemical sources of energy, nuclear energy,\nphysical sources of energy with wind energy, tidal en-\nergy, geothermal energy, magnetic fields) are regarded\nas possible primary power sources which could be used\n\n2/24/09 3:40:12 PM\n",

Thermal energy can be used either directly\nor via a thermodynamic cycle consisting of two energy\nconversion steps: thermal energy to torque, and torque\nto current conversion. This is described in more detail\nin Section 4.2.2.2.\n\nSolar radiation pressure (solar sails, \u201csailing\u201d\nin space) cannot be utilized for spacecraft power\nsupply.\n\nThe processing of helium-3 cannot be considered\nfor energy generation on the Moon (but perhaps for\nterrestrial fusion power plants). The same is true for\nhelium-3 energy generation for spacecraft. Nuclear\nsystems are used predominantly for military or\ninterplanetary missions to serve as a possible energy\nsource for the EPS. Detailed information follows in\nSection 4.2.2.3.\n\nTethered satellite systems with an electrically con-\nductive tether can be used for power generation since\nthere is an induced current caused by the movement\nof the tether in a magnetic field. They can also be used\nto produce thrust; the thrust generated by the current\nflowing through an electrical conductor is used to\ncompensate aerodynamic resistance. The electrody-\nnamic tether could be placed in a circular LEO orbit\nat a speed of approximately 7.6 km/s, depending on\nthe orbital radius (Figure 4.2.3).

A solar dynamic energy supply system can use a\nthermal\u2014mechanical-electrical energy converter or\na conventional thermodynamic cycle process with a\nclosed working medium cycle.\n\nFor the solar dynamic energy conversion process\nthe incoming, almost parallel solar irradiation (col-\nlimation angle 32 arc minutes) is reflected by a nearly\nrotationally symmetric parabolic collector onto a\nradiation receiver whose aperture is at the focus of\nthe parabolic collector and which is able to transfer\nthe reflected solar energy to a working medium. This\nso-called processing heat is used to generate mechani-\ncal energy with the help of a thermal engine.

In addition, the rotational speed is restricted\ndue to high centrifugal forces.\n\n4.2.2.3 Nuclear Power Supply\n\nThe static and dynamic conversion of thermal en-\nergy generated by nuclear processes is mainly found\nin satellites used for military reconnaissance and\nsurveillance missions flying in LEO, or for interstel-\nlar missions (unmanned deep-space missions). For\nsuch missions, photovoltaic systems would lead to\nunfavorable spacecraft configurations due to the large\ndemand on PVA areaas required to compensate for the\nlow solar intensity resulting from the long distance to\nthe Sun. Another application reason may be given by\nmissions with high space radiation exposure sufficient\nto damage photovoltaic components.\n\nNuclear power supply systems include radioiso-\ntope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and nuclear\nreactors. The latter can be further subdivided into\nstatic systems with direct energy conversion and\ndynamic systems using thermodynamic processes\n(Figure 4.2.6).\n\nRTGs using SNAP (System for Nuclear Auxil-\niary Power) with direct energy conversion have an\nefficiency of 7 = 5-10% and low power outputs\n(P= 1 kW). These systems were used for the Galileo\nand Ulysses satellite missions along with a GPHS\n(General Purpose Heat Source) expected to be able\nto survive catastrophic crashes.\n\nRTGs using dynamic isotope power systems\n(DIPS) are used in Brayton or ORC processes, yield-\ning an efficiency of n = 18-25% at an output power\nlevel of 1-10 kW,).\n\nNuclear reactors with direct energy conversion\nuse thermodynamic, thermionic and AMTECs (Alkali\nMetal Thermoelectric Converters) with an efficiency of\n7 = 10-19%.

State-of-the-art PMAD concepts use\neither regulated (constant) or nonregulated (varying)\nprimary power buses, or, in a combination of both\nmethods, a semiregulated or hybrid power supply\nsystem. The primary power of the spacecraft, in most\ncases generated by a (photovoltaic) solar array, will be\nfed into the main power bus (main bus) of the EPS, by\neither direct or indirect energy transfer, as necessary\nto cover the actual bus power demand.\n\nPower transfer from the solar array (SA) to the main\nbus by direct energy transfer (DET) corresponding\n\n2/24/09 3:40:19 PM\n",
    "267": "CHO04.indd Sec1:246\n\n246\n\nto the exact amount of power necessary to satisfy the\n\nbus power demand will be achieved by regulation\n\nmethods like (see Figure 4.2.9):\n\ne Shunt regulation (excess SA power will be bled off\nby shorting the corresponding amount of photo-\nvoltaic circuits (strings))\n\ne Series regulation (the SA power will be fed to the\nbus via a linear power regulator)\n\ne String switching (strings will be switched onto\nthe bus corresponding to the amount of power as\ndemanded by the power users).\n\nIn the case of indirect energy transfer the regulated\npower is provided to the main bus by DC/DC con-\nverters. These converters are controlled as a function\nof the required bus power demand by extracting the\nappropriate operating point on the SA power char-\nacteristic up to the power maximum. Therefore, this\ncontrol principle is also called maximum power point\ntracking (MPPT).\n\nMain Bus Concepts\n\nIn general DC voltage main buses are designed to\nsupply on-board users with power, and only in\nexceptional cases is AC voltage used.\n\nRegulated Bus\n\nThe classic, completely regulated primary power bus\n\n(BR) requires an efficient control loop for the three\n\ndomains of SA power conversion, battery charge and\n\nbattery discharge in order to provide in each power\n\ncontrol mode a permanently stabilized bus voltage\n\nof typically:\n\ne 28V ata distributed bus power up to 2.5kW\n\ne 50V ata distributed bus power up to 8.0kW\n\ne 100 and 125V at a distributed bus power above\n8kW.\n\nIt is recommended that bus voltages should not be\nselected below 20Vdc and not exceed 125 Vdc. Bus\nvoltages below 20 Vdc might lead to unwieldy current\ndensities, while bus voltages above 125 Vdc might\neasily generate dangerous potential gradients lead-\ning to ionization of air molecules (plasma) causing\ncoronal and electric arc discharges, in particular dur-\ning tests in partially pressurized environments.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nIt also has to be considered that the biggest selec-\ntion of OTS components is available for operating\nvoltages between 28 and 50 Vdc.\n\nMore restrictive standards like the ESA documents\nPSS-02-10 and ECSS-E-20A recommend selecting the\nnext highest available bus voltage above the value\n\nVP(V) for LEO (4.2.4)\n\nand\n\n0.5 P(V) for GEO (4.2.5)\n\n(P = primary bus power, V= bus voltage).\n\nThe advantages of the regulated bus are as\nfollows:\n\ne It is excellently suited to EPS systems using two\nor more batteries, in particular if direct parallel\nconnection of the batteries is not allowed, such as\nfor nickel-cadmium (NiCd) and nickel-hydrogen\n(NiH,) technologies. The reason is that, with the\nBR concept, each single battery is operated sepa-\nrately by using a dedicated battery charge regulator\n(BCR) and battery discharge regulator (BDR),\ntherefore the number of supply buses is indepen-\ndent of the number of batteries.\n\ne Potential linear increase of the bus voltage is pos-\nsible by later integration of additional electronic\nmodules to convert SA and battery energy.\ne Potentially a 14% higher efficiency of regulated\nbus-supplied user power supplies (DC/DC con-\nverters) is offered compared to an unregulated\nbus voltage since the converters require less input\nfiltering effort and also can be run at their optimal\noperating point.\n\ne Direct power connection to users lacking their\nown power supply is always possible.\n\ne No DET-typical power lockup, which means the\nretention or binding of SA power by clamping the\nbus voltage to the battery voltage level.\n\ne Low and controlled source impedance up to\n100 kHz in all power bus operating modes.\n\ne Simplified thermal design of the spacecraft\n(electric heater circuits deliver constant heat at a\nfixed bus voltage).\n\ne Good EMC performance due to load regulation\nand bus impedance performance.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:20 PM\n",

However, the minimum battery voltage\nmust in any case be analyzed for its compatibility\nwith the BDR input voltage range.\n\nThe disadvantages of the regulated bus are as\n\nfollows:\n\ne Higher EPS weight and higher cost because\nof the additional battery charge and discharge\nregulators.\n\ne Higher control loop effort for bus voltage\nregulation.\n\ne More SA power required because of\n\u2014 approx. 3-13% power loss in the BDR (Battery\n\nDischarge Regulator)\n\u2014 approx. 3-10% power loss in BCR.\n\ne The BDR must be able to cover all peak power\ndemands on the bus during the battery discharge\ncycle.\n\ne Application of passive fuses with high rated cur-\nrent is delicate, since the rupture current capability\nmust be provided either by the main bus capaci-\ntance (unlikely), or by the BDR.\n\nApplication Evaluation\nIn many cases direct supply of primary power users\nfrom a regulated bus is not needed, since almost all\nbus power supplied OTS units are equipped with\ntheir own input power DC/DC converter for accom-\nmodating a wide range of input voltages for multiple\napplications.\n\nIf no other advantages of the BR outweigh the dis-\nadvantages, there are no cost savings in using the BR.\n\nStandard Quality Requirements for the Regulated\n\nBus\n\ne Bus voltage regulation: +0.5% of the nominal\nvoltage in steady-state mode.\n\ne Voltage variation at load changes: +1% at load\nchanges of up to 50% of the nominal load and a\nmaximum of +5% of the nominal voltage at all\ntransient induced voltage swings.\n\ne In the case of a fuse blowing, recovery from the\nfuse clearance shall not produce an overshoot of\nmore than 10% above the nominal bus value.\n\ne Induced voltage ripple: < 0.5% peak to peak of the\nnominal bus voltage.\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:247\n\n247\n\nWhat Is Power Lockup?\n\nPower lockup for the example of a DET-regulated\nSA is an operating condition in which the SA is in\nfact capable of satisfying the bus power demands. It\nis clamped to a lower power operating point domi-\nnated by a lower voltage condition of the battery\n(e.g., after battery discharge at the end of an orbital\neclipse), which is directly connected to the main\nbus. If the momentary operating point power of\nthe SA is below the power demand on the bus, the\nbus remains trapped on the battery with the battery\nproviding the difference in power between what the\nbus load requires and what the array can provide at\nthe clamped voltage. The battery will be discharged\nfurther, thus reducing the bus voltage even more.\nWithout measures to relieve the bus, the battery\nwould be completely discharged, which might fi-\nnally lead to the loss of all functions on-board the\nspacecraft followed by a premature termination of\nthe whole mission.\n\nPower lockup is possible in any EPS topology if a\nrelative high ohmic current source like SA is directly\nconnected to a low ohmic voltage source (battery), as\nis the case in unregulated bus designs in combination\nwith a DET-regulated SA.\n\nPower lockup does not occur with MPPT\nregulation.\n\nUnregulated Bus\n\nThe concept of an unregulated bus (BU) is mainly\n\nused to simplify the on-board power supply system;\n\nhowever, it implies the requirement that the connected\n\nusers tolerate bus voltage variations of up to +20%.\nBattery voltage dominated, unregulated bus volt-\n\nages are inherently dependent on type and number\n\nof battery cells connected in series. Typical, but not\n\nstandardized ranges are:\n\ne 28V+6V ata bus power up to 2kW\n\ne 35V+7V ata bus power up to 3.5kW\n\ne 42V+8V ata bus power up to 5kW.\n\nHigher voltage ranges are not applied for typical\nsatellites. However, the technique of the unregulated\nbus is adaptable to 125V. Those voltage levels are\nneeded for specific satellite subsystems like an electric\npropulsion unit, for example, which needs voltage\nlevels around 100V.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:21 PM\n",

This is par-\nticularly advantageous for power supply bus op-\nerations with short but high peak loads or with\nimpulse power profiles occurring during radar\ninstrument operations. This advantage is sig-\nnificant for power bus operation at high power\npulse loads, or high peak power load profiles. The\nBDR of a regulated bus system would have to be\ndesigned for those peak loads, while the BU can\ndeliver any peak load above the available primary\npower directly from the battery without any ad-\nditional discharge control.\n\ne Less SA power is required since power losses\ncaused by BCR and BDR do not occur.\n\ne Higher numerical and functional EPS reliability\nbecause of reduced electronic circuitry.\n\nThe disadvantages of the unregulated bus are as\nfollows:\ne Almost all bus power users need their own\n\nauxiliary power supply (but this is standard for\n\nOTS equipment).\n\ne The user\u2019s internal auxiliary power supplies are\napproximated 1\u20144% less efficient if supplied from\na BU compared to BR-provided power because it\ndoes not operate at an optimized regulator duty\ncycle, and requires higher input filtering effort.\n\ne Higher design effort for the main bus filter in order\nto obtain an EMC qualified power bus.\n\ne The actually extracted SA power is determined by\nthe momentary battery voltage unless additional\nmeasures are foreseen (see the description of the\npower lockup condition).\n\ne Up to 50% higher losses within the power har-\nness, or up to 25% harness weight increase if\ncables with larger cross sections are used to reduce\npower losses.\n\ne Not suitable for EPS concepts using two or more\nNiCd or NiH, batteries.\n\ne An analysis of the bus voltage variations is neces-\nsary to determine the minimum bus voltage.\n\nApplication Evaluation\nThe BU is the most preferable solution for LEO ap-\nplications, where the addition of power regulators\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nfor battery charging has a significant weight and cost\nimpact, because the required battery charge power has\na level close to the total distributed bus power.\n\nThe BU is excellently suited for spacecraft with\npulsed loads as generated by a synthetic aperture\nradar (SAR), or with high peak power profiles, as\ngenerated by probes, or by satellites with specific com-\nmunication traffic above a congested area.\n\nThe BU is also a well-suited solution for spacecraft\napplying AC power supplies.\n\nSemiregulated Bus\nThe semiregulated bus (BS) is adopted as a com-\npromise between the two extremes of BR and BU, as\ndescribed above, and is usually based on the desire to\neliminate the weight and cost impact of the BDR on\nthe one hand, and to eliminate as far as possible the\npower lockup conditions of DET-regulated SA power,\non the other hand.\n\nThe BS system provides regulated bus voltage\nduring periods of sufficient SA power (sunlight\nperiod), or else battery-dominated unregulated bus\nvoltage during periods in which the generated SA\npower is not sufficient to provide the required bus\npower; that is, in cases where the battery is used to\naugment the required power (such as during eclipse\nphases, during peak loads temporarily exceeding SA\npower provision or during loss of Sun orientation\nof the SA).\n\nThe advantages of the semi-regulated bus are as\nfollows:\ne Provision of a BR-type stabilized main bus\nconnected to a solar generator performing at an\noptimum operating point as soon as the gener-\nated SA power exceeds the bus power demand.\nn this case the SA operating point as well as the\nusable SA power are no longer dominated by the\nactual battery voltage (no risk of a power lockup\ncondition).\ne EPS weight and cost savings because no additional\nBDR devices are necessary.\ne The BS concept could be adapted to EPS designs\nwith two or more NiCd or NiH, batteries.\n\nThe disadvantages of the semi-regulated bus are\nas follows:\ne All bus power users requiring a stabilized supply\nvoltage, but are not able to run during periods\n\n2/24/09 3:40:21 PM\n",

The relation of electrical power\nto the required array panel area is approx. 280 W/m\u201d\n(BOL, AMO, 28\u00b0C, 1 AU).\n\n4.2.5.7 Series Connection of Solar Cells\n\nThe number of solar cells to be connected in series\n(string length) is determined, as mentioned above, by\nthe EPS architecture, or, to be precise, by the voltage\noperating point of the array as determined by the\nchosen topology of the primary power bus. The string\nlength must be designed such that in the case of a\nDET-regulated array, the required voltage operating\npoint (V,,) is slightly below (approximately 3-5%)\nthe maximum power point voltage V,,,, expected for\nEOL.\n\nThis measure safeguards a design uncertainty\nwith respect to V,, (uncertainty in the analysis of the\narray operating temperature, drift of the electrical\ncharacteristics of the SA power regulation loop com-\nponents, etc.), which could lead to a drift in the voltage\noperating point V,, beyond MPP in the direction of\nthe open-circuit voltage, leading to an insufficient SA\npower provision.\n\nSuch a requirement must not be considered a\ndesign criterion for MPPT regulation. In the case of\nMPPT regulation the string length must be chosen\n\n2/24/09 3:40:27 PM\n",

The 10% voltage tolerance is needed for the linear\nbehavior of the MPPT control loop.\n\n4.2.5.8 Parasitic Capacitances and Inductances\n\nThe stability as well as the power loss of an SA power\nregulator can be strongly influenced by the electrody-\nnamic output characteristic of the SA. The main role\nis played by the capacitive reactance of the (Coulomb)\noutput capacitance at all operating points, while the\ndynamic resistance Ry becomes influential only at op-\nerating point voltages around V.,,, and above. Knowing\nthese parameters allows precise design of the power\nregulation as well as of the SA simulator to be used for\nsatellite functional testing, since it is then well adapted\nto the real electrical output parameters of the SA.\n\n4.2.5.9 Operating Temperatures\n\nFor the deployed SA, these are:\n\ne LEO, Sun-synchronous dawn-dusk orbit (e.g.,\nSentinel-1): approx. 70\u00b0C average for GaAs cells\n\ne LEO, with significant Earth IR and albedo cou-\npling (e.g., Aeolus): approx. 80\u00b0C average for\nGaAS cells\n\ne MEO (e.g., Galileo): 65\u00b0C\n\ne GEO (Telecom): approx. 60\u00b0C.\n\nFor a body-mounted SA, these are:\n\ne Roughly 20\u00b0C above the values of deployed SAs,\nthus 90-100 \u00b0C for LEO missions\n\ne Incase of a large Earth view factor of the PVA (ie.,\nthe Earth is completely in the field of view (FOV)\nof the PVA), also 115-120\u00b0C may occur.\n\nThe values for silicon cells are about 10-15 \u00b0C lower.\n\n4.2.5.10 Electrostatic Charging, Discharging\nand Discharge Effects\n\nCharging of satellite structures during so-called \u201csolar\nsubstorms\u201d can lead to electrostatic potentials from\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nseveral hundred to a thousand volts between adjacent\nsurfaces, in particular during sunlit phases.\n\nIn the presence of a charged particle environ-\nment the satellite chassis is charged negatively at a\nrate of \u20145 V/s. The front surface of the SA faces the\nSun, and charge from the usually non-conducting\nsurfaces of the cell cover glasses is constantly bled\noff via photoemission, while other areas, such as the\ngaps between the solar cells, will remain negatively\ncharged since they are shaded by the edges of the\nsolar cells.\n\nA potential difference between the cover glass and\nunderlying cell of several hundred volts is gradually\nbuilt up at a rate of approx. 3V/s.\n\nIf the voltage difference reaches a sufficient level,\nprimary electric arc discharges will occur. These\ndischarges carry very little energy and are harmless\nas a single event. However, they can set free plasma\nfrom the molecular cell structure which settles in the\ngaps between the cells. Several hundred discharge\nevents can lead to a plasma concentration establishing\na low ohmic connection to the adjacent solar cell. If\nthe difference between the nominal operating point\nvoltages of the adjacent cells is high enough and if\nan appropriate photocurrent is generated within the\ncells, a secondary sustained arc could form carrying\nsufficient energy to produce a short circuit. The energy\nof a sustained secondary arc is usually high enough\nto cause permanent damage by evaporation of solar\ncell material and of the underlying insulation (string\nfailures) [4.2.4], [4.2.5], [4.2.6].\n\nSince the primary electric arc discharges can only\nbe avoided by a conductive coating of the array sur-\nface, which entails other severe disadvantages, the\nconditions allowing secondary electric arcs must be\neliminated.\n\nThis is achieved by appropriate measures in the\nsolar cell string design. The goal is to make sure that\nthe voltage difference between adjacent cells as a\nfunction of the gap size between the cell edges never\nreaches the discharge level and that the driving cur-\nrent remains low enough. The latter is achieved by\nadding a decoupling diode in series to each string\nand by parallel connection of the strings to an array\nbehind the diode.

Every spacecraft relying for its primary\nenergy only on solar energy needs some kind of energy\nstorage to ensure the support of the electrical loads\nalso during eclipse phases or other periods of low solar\nirradiation on the SA.\n\nEnergy storage is usually realized by a battery,\nalthough other energy storage systems like flywheels\nor fuel cells have also been sporadically used in some\nspacecraft.\n\nA battery consists of individual electrochemical\ncells connected in series for multiplication of the cell\nvoltage. Identical battery cells or cells with thoroughly\nharmonized parameters, such as lithium-ion cells, can\nbe connected in parallel to enhance the amount of\nstored electric charge (capacity).\n\nBatteries consist of primary or secondary cells.\n\nIn primary cells the chemical energy is converted\nto electrical energy. In contrast to secondary cells the\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:257\n\n257\n\nFigure 4.2.20: NiH, battery with 20 cells in series.\n\nconversion process in primary cells is irreversible.\nSince they cannot be recharged, their application\nis limited to short mission durations of several\ndays to a few weeks. The most common primary\ncell types are silver\u2014zinc, lithium thionylchloride,\nlithium-sulfur dioxide, lithium monofluoride and\nthermal cells.\n\nA secondary battery allows some thousands of\ncharge and discharge cycles depending on its depth\nof discharge (DOD), the charging method and the\noperating temperature. This makes it useful as an\nenergy storage system for a spacecraft mission with\nan expected in-orbit lifetime of many years, such as\nLEO missions of seven years and more with 14 to 15\nSun and shadow phases daily. In such operations, the\nbattery has to perform nominal for 15 (orbits) x 365\n(days) x7 (years), which equals 38 325 charge\u2014dis-\ncharge cycles.\n\n4.2.6.1 Secondary Battery Technologies\n\nRechargeable batteries used for energy storage\nsystems in spacecraft rely on three technologies:\nnickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-hydrogen (NiH,)\nand lithium-ion cells (Li-ion). The two main tech-\nnologies are the NiH, battery (Figure 4.2.20), which\nhas been used for over two decades for space applica-\ntions, and the new Li-ion battery (Figure 4.2.21) used\nincreasingly since 2002.\n\nFor present spacecraft developments NiCd is usu-\nally not within the scope of application, and this is\nbecoming more and more the issue also for NiH.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:35 PM\n",

This degradation of battery\nvoltage is a gradual process caused mainly by the\ncontinuous increase of the cell\u2019s internal resistance\n4.2.8).\n\nThe cycle life depends directly on the DOD that the\nbattery is operated with during its operational life. For\nexample, cycle lifetimes of some thousands of cycles\nfor an 80% DOD and some hundreds of thousands\nof cycles for a 10% DOD are possible.\n\nIt is good practice in space applications to follow\nthe rule of allowing a continuous DOD of 85% for\nNiCd and NiH, and 60-70% for Li-ion cells.\n\nThe cycle life for NiCd and NiH, cells (see\nFigure 4.2.22) can be considered to be equal. For\nLi-ion cells most manufacturers have developed an\nalgorithm to calculate capacity losses (capacity fading)\nas a function of calendar and cycle life.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFor space-qualified NiCd and NiH, batteries a\ngood approximation of cycle life can be calculated\nwith the formula\n\nCL= 207 800 \u00ab e602\u00bb POP {%61) (4.2.13)\n1.0E+06\n8s oes0s \u2014~ y = 207829\u00a2 0.0272x\n3 pI \u2014\u2014\n2\n3\n& 1.0504\nz\n1.0E+03\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nDOD [%]\n\nFigure 4.2.22: Typical cycle life of NiH, batteries.\n\nThe following mathematical relationship is in\nfact not applicable for all Li-ion cell types, but is an\nappropriate way to estimate the capacity fading (CF)\nof large cells with capacities of 20 ampere-hours and\nabove:\n\nCF [%]= Calender Loss [%] + Cycling Loss [%]\n\nCF =ka time +ke {number ofcycles, (4.2.14)\nwith ka the calendar life in years:\n\nka (temperature/\u00b0C )= (4.2.15)\n0.0009 - 6? \u2014 0.0129 - 6 + 0.1533\n\nkc (DOD) =0.005 - DOD [%] + 0.021 (4.2.16)\n\nThe shelf life is the time that an inactive battery\ncan be stored before it becomes unusable, usually\nconsidered as being less than the nameplate capacity\nafter a prescribed recharge cycling.\n\nTemperature Effects\nIncreased operating and storage temperatures might\nreduce battery lifetime significantly.\n\nThe warmer the battery, the faster the chemi-\ncal reactions. High temperatures can thus provide\n\n2/24/09 3:40:37 PM\n",

In\naddition, the negative temperature coefficient of the\ncell voltage at increased temperature causes a lower\noperating voltage. At constant power bus load and\nconsequently at constant battery discharge power a\nreduction of the battery voltage increases the battery\ndischarge current, and thereby also the DOD, since\nDOD isa function of the ampere-hours taken from\nthe battery. As mentioned above, a higher DOD re-\nduces the cycle life of the battery.\n\nDepth of Discharge\n\nThe relation between cycle life and DOD is amply\ndiscussed above: the empirically determined math-\nematical algorithm is an exponential function with\nits exponent increasing with lower DODs.\n\nThis holds an important lesson for the battery\ndesigner: significant increases in cycle life can be\nachieved by a well considered thermal design.\n\nManufacturers of battery cells should either pro-\nvide sufficient data for the analysis of the allowable\nnumber of cycles as a function of DOD, or, even better,\nprovide the mathematical relationship itself.\n\nMicrocycles with a DOD below 0.1%, as usually\noccur with impulse loads, do not influence cycle life\nexpectancy.\n\nCell Voltage Effects\nAll battery cell technologies have a characteristic\noperating voltage range. The definition of the usable\nvoltage range is a consequence of the onset of undesir-\nable chemical reactions which take place beyond the\nsafe working range.\n\nOnce all active chemicals are converted to stored\nenergy during the charging process, which means\nthat the battery is completely charged, any further\ncharge energy applied to a battery cell will heat up the\ncell. If overcharging happens over too long a time or\ntoo often, irreversible reactions will occur leading to\npermanent damage, particularly in Li-ion cells. The\npermanent increase of cell temperature by overcharg-\ning leads to increasing cell pressure, which means that\nuncontrolled overcharging can cause bursting or even\nexplosion of a cell, releasing dangerous chemicals or\neven causing open fires [4.2.8]. Tests with Li-ion cells\ndemonstrated that overcharging by increasing the cell\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:259\n\n259\n\nvoltage at the end of the charge process by 0.1 to 0.3V\ncauses a decrease in cycle life of up to 80%. Also, only\na few deep discharges below the values specified by\nthe manufacturer (typically 2.5 to 2.7V) can cause\npermanent damage in Li-ion cells.\n\nNiCd cells are somewhat less sensitive to over-\ncharging. A permanent overcharging of 5-10% causes\nonly a small temperature increase of less than 10\u00b0C.\nThe NiH, cell is even less sensitive to permanent\novercharging of up to 20%. A charge factor (k-factor)\nof 1.2 is even used to balance the capacity of the\nindividual battery cells (cell balancing).\n\nProtective circuits and well adapted charge control\nmethods must assure operation of the battery cells\nwithin their recommended operating ranges. A rea-\nsonable operational safety margin should be included\nin the design of a charge controller.\n\nMemory Effect\n\nThe so-called \u201cmemory effect\u201d is another manifesta-\ntion of the changing morphology of the cell com-\nponents with age. NiCd, and to a lesser extent NiH,,\ncells \u201cremember\u201d how much constant energy was\ndrained from the battery over many previous cycles,\nand only accept this particular amount of recharge\nenergy. What happens in fact is that repeated shallow\ncharges cause crystalline changes in the cell electrodes\nwhich increase the internal resistance of the cell. This\nis why, during charge as well as during discharge, the\npermitted voltage limits are reached much earlier, thus\nreducing battery capacity. Long, slow charging phases\nlike \u201ctrickle charge\u201d and increased operating tem-\nperatures support this undesirable behavior [4.2.8].\nPeriodic reconditioning of nickel-based battery cells\nallows recovery of the capacity lost by the memory\neffect. It would be even better, if possible, to cycle the\nbattery, after having experienced a few hundred cycles\nat low DOD, for some 10 cycles with higher charge\nand discharge energy.\n\nReconditioning and Capacity Restoration\n\nIt is often possible to restore the full capacity by one\nor even several deep discharges with a low and con-\ntrolled current down to a cell voltage of 1V [4.2.8].\nReconditioning of Li-ion cells using deep discharge\nto alow cell voltage level is not allowed, as mentioned\nabove.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:38 PM\n",
    "281": "CHO04.indd Sec1:260\n\n260\n\nIt is often possible to restore a cell to, or near to,\nits full capacity essentially by repeating the formation\nprocess to break down the larger crystals into their\nprevious smaller size.\n\nBattery Charging\n\nIn most cases, a battery\u2019s total losses or early degrada-\ntion are caused by improper charging methods. The\nuse of a well-designed and adapted charge regulator is\nmandatory for secure und durable battery operations.\nSuitable charge regulator concepts are discussed in the\nfollowing section.\n\nInteractions between Battery Cells\n\nInteractions between cells can occur in multicell\nbatteries caused by unbalanced temperature condi-\ntions in individual cells or in conjunction with the\nspread in electrical characteristics caused by manu-\nfacturing tolerances. Nonuniform aging patterns\ncan cause some cells to absorb less charge energy\nthan others.\n\nIna series connection of battery cells such effects\nwould drive the \u201cweak\u201d cell with reduced capacity to\nreach the end-of-charge voltage prematurely, while\nthe other cells with nominal characteristics would\nnot yet have reached the completely charged state. If\nthe charge status of the weak cell is ignored and more\ncharge energy is applied, the weak cell will be over-\ncharged and possibly damaged [4.2.8]. If the charge\nprocess is ended once the weak cell has reached its\nend-of-charge voltage, which by all means would be\nthe correct charge process, then the battery\u2019s nominal\ncapacitance would not be reached; however, individual\ncells would not be stressed excessively.\n\nIn analogy to the charge behavior also in the\ndischarge mode, a weak cell reduces the available\ncapacitance because it reaches its end-of-discharge\nvoltage while the other cell could be discharged fur-\nther. Continuation of the discharge will lead to deep\ndischarge of the weak cell, and in the case of Li-ion\ncells very quickly damage the cell.\n\nPremature Failure\n\nThe most likely cause of premature failure of a battery\nis abuse; that is, subjecting a battery to conditions for\nwhich it was never designed.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nBesides physical abuse of a battery, the following\noperational conditions are considered as misuse\n[4.2.8]:\n\ne Increased discharge current: The guideline for\ngood cycle life is a continuous discharge current\n<1Cand an impulse discharge current <2C (with\nC as a current value equivalent to the nominal\n(nameplate) capacity of the battery).\n\ne Increased charge current: The guideline for good\ncycle life is a continuous full charge current $0.8C\nand a trickle charge current of < C/100 for NiCd\nand < C/60 for NiH,.\n\ne Too high or too low operating temperatures: The\nguidelines for operating temperatures are listed\nin Table 4.2.6.\n\ne Use of a charge regulator designed for another\ncell technology.\n\ne Overcharge or deep discharge.\n\ne Excessive vibrations or mechanical shock.\n\nTable 4.2.6: Temperature ranges for optimal battery operation.\n\nTemperature NiCd and Liion\n\nregions NiH,\n\nOperating -10 to +25\u00b0C -10 to +35 \u00b0C\n\nNon-operating -15 to +35\u00b0C -20 to +40\u00b0C\n\nCharge optimum -10 to +10\u00b0C +15 to +25\u00b0C\n\nDischarge optimum +10 to +25\u00b0C 0 to +30\u00b0C\nCell Balancing\n\nAs already discussed in the section describing cell\nvoltage effects, Li-ion cells do not tolerate overcharge\nand deep discharge outside the voltage limits specified\nby the manufacturer. As described above (see inter-\nactions between battery cells) unequal properties of\nindividual cells might lead to those operational con-\nditions causing possible interactions of individual\ncells among themselves. To avoid this effect for Li-ion\ncells, the so-called method of cell balancing (charge\nbalancing) is used. The principle is described in\nSection 4.2.6.4.\n\nFor batteries connected in parallel the requirement\nfor cell balancing is not that important since batteries\nconnected in parallel have the tendency to balance\nthemselves (self-balancing).\n\n2/24/09 3:40:39 PM\n",
    "282": "4.2. Electrical Power Supply\n\nSelection of Cells\n\nIn order to avoid problems caused by manufacturing\ntolerances, cells must be combined with a battery fol-\nlowing specific selection criteria, such as only using\ncells from the same manufacturing batch, or assuring\nminimal electrical characteristic deviations by clas-\nsification using tests [4.2.8].\n\n4.2.6.2 Comparison of Battery Technologies\n\nA comparison of battery technologies is based on\nphysical proportions and electrical properties. Besides\nthe differing performance characteristics, the differ-\nent chemical cell compositions also require different\noperating conditions. The most important parameters\nwere discussed above.\n\nThe NiH, cell, characterized by robust and stable\nchemical composition, not only allows deep discharge\nand overcharge (as long as the heat is dissipated\nsufficiently and the internal cell pressure of up to\n70+ 10\u00b0 hPa is continuously monitored), but also toler-\nates reverse current associated with polarity reversal of\nthe cell voltage. For the time being, the NiH, system\nis the one with the most in-orbit operational experi-\nence and has demonstrated excellent cycle lifetimes.\nThe NiCd cell can be judged similarly, but with lower\novercharge and less tolerable reverse current.\n\nThe Li-ion cell must be protected from all these op-\nerational modes and therefore requires a sophisticated\nbattery management system. Also, the relatively small\namount of in-orbit operational experience must be\ncompensated by higher protection efforts. Despite the\ncost impact of the additional effort to guarantee safe\nin-orbit operations, the Li-ion cell offers, with its:\n\ne more than double energy density properties (watt\nhours per weight, Wh/kg)\n\ne relatively low voltage variation between full charge\nand discharge states\n\ne high charge efficiency, low power losses (little heat\ngeneration) and\n\ne small volume,\n\nmany good arguments for its present very dominant\nuse in spacecraft.\n\nGuidelines for Li-ion Cells: Since there is not yet\nenough in-orbit operating data available, the Li-ion\ncell should not be operated with more than 30% DOD\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:261\n\n261\n\nfor missions requiring a high number of cycles (LEO\nmissions might last several years) and currently with\nnot more than 70% DOD for all GEO missions.\n\nEnergy storage systems for small satellites in par-\nticular require small volumes with low weight. NiH,\ntechnology has experienced many new developments\nand improvements in energy density during its use in\nspace applications. The development steps led from\nsingle cells in separate pressure containers (individual\npressure vessel, IPV) via double-cell pressure con-\ntainers (common pressure vessel, CPV) to pressure\ncontainers comprising 22 to 28 integrated cells (single\npressure vessel, SPV). All those improvements could\nnot compensate the decisive advantage of the Li-ion\ncell technology of providing a nominal (average) cell\nvoltage of 3.6 V (in comparison to 1.25 V for NiH, and\n1.2V for NiCd). Tables 4.2.7 and 4.2.8 compare the\nproperties on the cell and battery level.\n\nIn contradiction to NiH,, space-qualified Li-ion\nbattery cells of individual manufacturers develop\ndifferent charge and discharge characteristics. The\nmost important parameter in this regime, namely\nthe cell voltage as a function of the battery state of\ncharge (SOC), and also versus DOD, is quite different,\nas shown in Figures 4.2.23 and 4.2.24.\n\n4.2.6.3 Principles for Battery Capacity Sizing\n\nBefore the required battery capacity can be calculated\nfor a given spacecraft mission the required stored\nenergy must be known for all mission dependent\noperational modes, taking anomalies and battery\ndegradation due to mission lifetime into account.\n\nIt is assumed that the total primary power bus\npower (P,,,,) for the longest possible battery discharge\nduration (t,,,), usually the eclipse phase during one\norbit, is known either by summing all single constant\nloads or by averaging load power profiles, say, by using\na spreadsheet program. The power losses in power\ndistribution due to voltage drops along the cables (P,)\nas well as the energy conditioning losses within the\nEPS (P<) must be determined as well.\n\nFurther, the mission duration and the orbit\nparameters must be known, allowing calculation of\nthe average eclipse duration (f,,) and the number of\nbattery discharges due to the number of eclipses (Nz)\nduring the time of the mission.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:39 PM\n",

In this case a\nhighly precise voltage measurement for each single\ncell or for each parallel cell connection is required to\navoid any overcharge (see also the discussion on cell\nvoltage effects in the previous section).

Charge commuta-\ntion across the parasitic SA capacitances, induced\nfrom control of SA power by shunt switching, may\nproduce a response time delay in the control loop,\nand may effect increased switching transients and\nlosses.\n\nMaximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe advantages are as follows:\n\ne Since with this method the MPP of the SA is au-\ntomatically extracted, the maximum available SA\npower can be utilized whenever needed, indepen-\ndent of the SA voltage, current and temperature.\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:265\n\nThis makes it possible to save between 8 and 25%\nof the installed SA power.\n\ne MPPT introduces excellent flexibility with respect\nto cell string layout and string length, cell size and\ncell type.\n\ne MPPT might be the solution for missions with\nstrong variations in solar intensity (interplanetary\nmissions).\n\ne Pulse width modulated (PWM) DC/DC con-\nverters used for MPPT regulation are largely in-\nsensitive to the electrodynamic behavior of the\nSA. This aspect becomes more and more a focal\npoint because the SA output capacitances are\nbecoming increasingly higher through the use of\nmegajoule solar cells (significantly fewer cells in\nseries form one string), the development of ever\nthinner semiconductor layers for solar cells, and\nthe permanently growing demand on higher SA\npower for high-power spacecraft.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nMPPT regulation requires more circuit design effort\n\nthan DET, causing higher weight and cost.\n\nFor a rough comparison of the weight increase\nbetween MPPT and DET the following rules of thumb\ncan be used:\n\ne MPPT-regulated power transfer: 2.5g/W (at\n28V output voltage), 2.4g/W (at 50V), 2.2g/W\n(at 100V) but offering 20% reduction by new\ndevelopments.\n\ne DET-regulated power transfer: 42g - P;,(BOL)/\nVous With Pg as the maximum SA power to be\ntransferred.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:43 PM\n",

    "288": "4.2. Electrical Power Supply\n\nactive devices are known as LCLs (Latching Current\nLimiters), FCLs (Fold-back Current Limiters) and\nSSPCs (Solid-State Power Controllers).\n\nApplication of Fuses\n\nGenerally the application of fuses for protecting power\nlines is a delicate matter requiring careful selection of\nfuse types and a thoroughly accomplished analysis of\nfuse current rating. For example, in ESA programs\nfuses are to be avoided whenever possible.\n\nUse of Active Current Limiters\n\nThe LCL is a semiconductor switch which can be\ncommanded in the on- and off-state. Its output over-\ncurrent protection is set for a defined time span to a\ndefined value (typically approx. 160% of the nominal\ncurrent for 5-10 ms).\n\nIf the current increases above these limits the load\nwill be disconnected. The LCL will stay in the off-\ncondition until it is reactivated by an on-command.\n\nThe FCL is a semiconductor switch which can-\nnot be commanded. The switch is able to tolerate\nan overcurrent of 10-25% of the rated value for an\nunlimited time. If this current limit is exceeded, the\nFCL output current will be reduced to a lower value\nat a lower output voltage, but does not disconnect the\nuser. As soon as the overload condition is removed,\nthe FCL automatically reverts to its nominal operat-\ning conditions.\n\nThe SSPC is a commercial circuit similar to the\nLCL function. Its use in spacecraft is usually prohibited\nby the lack of space flight qualification.\n\n4.2.7.6 Power Distribution\n\nThe following rules for power distribution within\n\nspacecraft are generally followed:\n\ne Users supplied by the main bus are connected\nindividually. This means that also redundant\nequipment or functions with their own auxiliary\npower supplies have to be connected via separate\npower lines.\n\ne Each individual power line is distributed and\ntwisted together with a dedicated return line of\nthe same size.\n\ne The power harness is designed to distribute all\nprimary and secondary power with minimum\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:267\n\n267\n\ndegradation and permissible losses; this is also true\nunder peak load conditions.\n\ne Power return lines of users working with signal\nfrequencies of less than 10 MHz must be returned\ndirectly to the CGP.\n\ne The primary power distribution design within\nthe spacecraft should include not less than two\nsingle commandable on/off switches for a single\nsupply interface. The on/off switches are prefer-\nably semiconductor switches, or as an alternative\ncurrent impulse relays (latch relays).\n\ne Ifarelay is used, the overcurrent protection device\nmust be connected between the relay contact and\nits connection to the main bus.\n\ne The operational current density through a relay\ncontact is only 50% of the rated current for the\nrelay contact.\n\nBibliography\n\n4.2.1 ECSS-E-20A.

The technologies and techniques\napplied to reach this aim are selected according to\nthe applicable temperature ranges, which according\nto [4.3.1] can be defined as follows:\n\ne <200K cryogenic range\n\ne 200 to 470K conventional range\n\ne > 470K high-temperature range.\n\nKnown thermal processes have varying importance\nin these temperature ranges. Heat exchange by\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nconduction and radiation should be minimized in\nthe cryogenic range in order to reduce heat transfer\ninto these low-temperature systems. Typical appli-\ncations are optical systems in the infrared region or\nrocket stages with liquid oxygen and hydrogen as the\npropellant. Low heat conduction is also important in\nhigh-temperature systems (e.g., reentry bodies). In\naddition, heat protection systems based on ablation are\napplied: a protection shield consumes itself through\nevaporation at the hot surface with the effect that the\nreleased heat of evaporation is not introduced into\nthe protection system.\n\nMost of today\u2019s space systems operate in the con-\nventional temperature range, since the employed\nelectronics are developed and qualified for tempera-\ntures between about \u201440 and +50\u00b0C. Science satellites,\nEarth observation systems and communication satel-\nlites as well as planetary and interplanetary probes and\nlanding systems fall in this category. The mentioned\noperating temperature range applies to units which\nare located inside the spacecraft. For external units\nquite large ranges are defined (e.g., \u2014170 to +90\u00b0C for\nantennas and \u2014160 to +80\u00b0C for solar arrays).\n\nThe next sections address in detail the basic ther-\nmal principles, the development steps of analysis and\ntesting, as well as examples of thermal technologies.\nThe section closes with a description of an imple-\nmented design example including a typical operating\nsequence for a thermal control system.\n\n4.3.2 Basic Thermal Principles\n\n4.3.2.1 Environmental Conditions\n\nThe following explanations concern satellites in an\nEarth orbit but are analogously true also for orbits\naround other planets.\n\nOnly conditions outside the atmosphere are of\nrelevance for satellites, since bodies also in low orbits\ninteract with only a reduced number of atoms and\nmolecules in the remaining atmosphere. For a thermal\ndesign the influence of convective heat transfer can\ntherefore be neglected.\n\nA satellite therefore interacts with its environment\nonly by radiation, and the desired temperatures can\nbe achieved by skillful control of heat fluxes within\n\n2/24/09 3:40:46 PM\n",

Heat exchange by radiation\ncan be influenced by selection of suitable thermo-op-\ntical surfaces and heat transfer by conduction through\nmaterials with tailored heat conductivity. Moreover,\nthermal contact resistance plays an important role for\nheat conduction in multiple component systems.\n\nThe (waste) heat released in a spacecraft must be\nradiated to the space environment, which exhibits\na background temperature of about T, = 3K. For\nthis purpose radiators are attached to the outside\nsurfaces of a satellite; they have thermo-optical pro-\nperties with low emissivity in the infrared range and\nlow absorptance over the entire solar spectrum. In\naddition to the direct solar radiation on satellites in\nEarth orbits, the absorbed environmental energy due\nto solar planetary reflection and the infrared radiation\nof Earth as a warm body must be taken into account\n(Figure 4.3.1).\n\nThe energy balance of a satellite can therefore be\nillustrated in a simplified way as in Figure 4.3.2.\n\nDepending on whether the external temperature\nis higher or lower than the satellite temperature, the\ninsulation heat leak is either a heat gain or heat loss\nfor the satellite. A physical equilibrium temperature\nis established when the sum of the received energy,\nincluding the thermal dissipation of satellite com-\nponents, equals the energy which is radiated into the\nenvironment.\n\nThermal control guarantees specified working\ntemperatures for all components of a satellite and is\ntherefore a service task for the remaining subsystems.\nThe relevant interfaces to components, units and to\nthe satellite system are exemplarily listed in Figure\n4.3.3.\n\nThe solar energy received near Earth is expressed\nby the solar constant S and is according to [4.3.2]\ndefined as the radiation which impinges on a surface\nper unit of time with the surface element arranged\nperpendicular to the radiation and located outside\nthe atmosphere at a distance of 1 AU to the Sun. Since\nthe Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical\norbit, the value of the solar constant is not constant\nthroughout one Earth orbit [4.3.3].

A body emits energy into the\nhalf space above its surface which is proportional\nto its surface F and to the fourth power of its tem-\nperature T. The radiation intensity depends on the\nproperties of the radiating surface and is expressed\nby its ability to radiate or by the emissivity of the\nsurface.\nThe emitted energy is expressed in\n\nP.=0 \u20acT' F (4.3.2)\n\nwith o=5.67- 10\u00b0 W/(m\u2019 K*) the Stefan\u2014Boltzmann\nconstant.\n\nWhen a body is exposed to radiation, a part will\nbe absorbed, a part reflected and a part transmitted\nthrough the body. The impinging radiation follows\nthe expression\n\natBry=1 (4.3.3)\nwhere:\n\na= solar absorption,\n\nB= reflection,\n\ny= transmission.\n\nCHO4.indd Sect:271\n\n271\n\nFor satellites the transmission is less important, since\nall thermally relevant materials are not translucent.\nFor the absorbed energy the following applies:\n\nP=: S-F, (4.3.4)\n\nwhere:\nS = radiation intensity or solar flux density,\nF, = projected area.\n\nThe Kirchhoff radiation law postulates that an\narbitrary surface absorbs energy to the extent that it\nemits energy, as long as the spectral distribution of\nthe absorbed and emitted radiation correspond to\neach other. Therefore\n\nOQ), =E, (4.3.5)\nIn practice the symbols @ and \u00e9 do have different\nmeanings.\n\nThe term (solar) absorptance defines the capa-\nbility of a surface to absorb radiation in the solar\nspectrum. Solar energy, compared to the radiation of\na black body at 5760K, covers a wider spectral band\n(Figure 4.3.5). Of the total radiation energy, 97% is\nlocated in the wavelength range between 2 = 0.2 and\n2.8 1m, with a maximum at about 0.48 Um.\n\nThe average solar absorptance is defined for this\nwavelength region. The spectral radiation flux den-\nsity E (irradiance) can be defined with the Planck\nradiation law. Integration over all wavelengths and\nthe radiation density over the half space gives the total\nenergy or the radiation flux density in W/m\u2019 according\nto the Stefan\u2014Boltzmann law.\n\nThe (thermal) emissivity depends on the tem-\nperature of the radiating body. However, for the\ntemperature range applicable to a spacecraft, emissivity\nvalues of about 300K can be applied. Consequently,\nand according to Wien\u2019s displacement law, the ra-\ndiation is located within the infrared band with a\nmaximum at about 8m.

Parameters (e.g., temperatures)\nare generally assigned to and calculated for the edge\nnodes and interpolated across the element, if they\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:281\n\n281\n\nx x\u201d\nSurface elements\n\nv\n\nVolume elements\n\nFigure 4.3.16: Node and element definition for the FE method.\n\ndiffer. Consequently, properties of an element are not\nconstant (in contrast to the isothermal nodes of the\nfinite difference method).\n\nThe FEM calculates an explicit expression for the\ntemperature, based on known relationships which\nsatisfy the governing differential equations and the\nboundary conditions of the element. The method is\nvery versatile and able to solve steady-state, dynamic,\nthermal and electromagnetic problems, as well as\nnonlinear problems (distortions, nonlinear material\nproperties, contact problems).\n\nThere are reasons why the FEM is not being used\nall that often in thermal analysis. Since the accuracy\nof an FE analysis increases with the number of ele-\nments, namely the detail of the element network, an\nFE model generally uses some hundreds to thousands\nof nodes in order to obtain adequate results. This is a\ndisadvantage for calculating thermal problems, since,\nas shown above, analyzed temperatures are assigned\nto each node. Such a high number of calculated tem-\nperatures is not necessary for a thermal analysis.\n\nDiffuse nodes (nodes with mass) and edge nodes\nare also used in the FEM; however, arithmetic nodes\n(those without mass) cannot be included. In addition,\n\n2/24/09 3:40:59 PM\n",

As a result, the FE model\nfor typical thermal analysis cases is always larger than\nnecessary. In addition, curved surfaces like cones and\ncylinders require many more finite surface elements to\ndescribe the configuration than are used for the finite\ndifference method. For the latter method a 360\u00b0 node\nis often sufficient, which cannot be introduced into\nthe FEM. While for radiative heat exchange according\nto the Monte Carlo method the true representation\nof a curved surface is accepted, these surfaces in the\nFEM are represented by flat elements or they are\napproximated by a polynomial adaptation. As a con-\nsequence, the accuracy of the radiation view factor\ncalculations may be decreased, which would again\nrequire compensation with an increased number of\nelements. The combination of an increased number\nof surface elements and resulting view factors may in\naddition increase the complexity and duration of the\nthermal analysis.\n\n4.3.3.3 Verification by Testing\n\nAfter the analytical design phase and after hardware\nmanufacturing, a test phase follows with the aim of\ndemonstrating that the hardware fulfills specified\nrequirements. In general there is a distinction made\nbetween three test categories.\n\nDevelopment tests are conducted very early in the\nprogram to determine the usefulness of new technical\nconcepts and to reduce risks before the manufacture\nof flight hardware commences. Experience obtained\nduring development tests flows into procedures for\nqualification and acceptance tests for flight hardware\ndesigns.\n\nQualification tests are formal demonstrations\nthat the design and manufacturing process produces\ncorrect flight hardware which meets the requirements.\nThese tests also validate acceptance test procedures,\nincluding test methodology, instrumentation and\nnecessary software. In order to meet these aims, the\ntest conditions are more stringent than the expected\nflight conditions. Qualification hardware is therefore\nnot flown.\n\nAcceptance tests are again formal tests which\ndemonstrate the adequacy of the supplied hardware\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nfor application as flight hardware. The test demon-\nstrates that the specified requirements have been\nmet and that no hidden failures are present due to\nmanufacturing error or material selection.\n\nIn the mentioned test categories different thermal\ntests are performed, as follows.\n\nDuring the thermal cycle test the test object is\nalternately exposed to cold and warm temperatures.\nOn an equipment level these tests are mostly con-\nducted in air and the subsequent convection helps\nto accelerate the change between the temperature\nextremes. Thermal stress due to thermal cycling un-\ncovers hidden flaws in the material and any mounting\nerrors that may have occurred during integration of\nthe test object. As a second goal functional tests are\nperformed which need to be successful at the extreme\ntemperatures.\n\nAlso during thermal vacuum testing the test ob-\nject undergoes temperature cycles. Since the natural\nconvection is eliminated, this test represents real space\nconditions and realistic functional tests are possible.\nSince the change between temperature extremes is\nslower here (the lack of convection), the thermal stress\nbehavior is less important.\n\nA thermal balance test is generally performed on\nthe subsystem or system level and is mostly part of\nthe above described thermal vacuum test. This is the\nmost important test for a thermal subsystem and has\ntwo important aims:\n\ne Verification of the thermal design\ne Correlation with the mathematical simulation\nmodel.\n\nFlight conditions which are decisive for the design\nof the thermal system are derived for this test and\ntest results are compared to the analytical predic-\ntion which has been determined with the thermal\nmathematical model. After successful correlation\nthe mathematical model is verified and temperature\npredictions for the flight phase can be made. Test\ncases mostly include warm and cold flight conditions\nin order to cover all aspects of the subsystem design,\nincluding the operational heater system, dimensioning\nof the radiators, and critical heat fluxes. The large test\ncenters in Europe offer the possibility also to simulate\nsolar radiation, which is used for complex spacecraft\nconfigurations.\n\n2/24/09 3:40:59 PM\n",

The same effect\ncan be achieved with electrically actuated coating,\nwhich changes the coefficient of emissivity.\n\ne Employ materials with high thermal conductivity\n(aluminum, high-conductivity carbon fiber) or\nwith low thermal conductivity (plastics).\n\ne Use two-phase cooling loops to efficiently trans-\nport heat between distant spots in a spacecraft or\nto isothermalize radiator areas (heat pipes, loop\nheat pipes).\n\ne Use of heating elements to regulate and stabilize\nthe temperature of specific parts.\n\nIn the following the most important methods are\nexplained in more detail.\n\n4.3.4.2 Thermal Insulation\n\nThermal insulation is applied to minimize heat fluxes\nbetween two temperature regimes.

This\nconsiderably decreases internal temperature varia-\ntions caused by externally varying environmental\nconditions.\n\nIn an isolated system where forces and moments must\nbe transmitted from a location of high temperature to\na location of low temperature, or vice versa, thermal\ninsulation may also be accomplished through specific\ndesign solutions. In such unconventional techniques\nthe insulation effect of spherical contact surfaces is\nused; for example, commercial ball bearings from steel\nor glass are forced as a \u201clayer\u201d between two or more\nmetal plates or between co-cylindrical tubes [4.3.11].\nDepending on selected design options, force pattern\nand material properties, different thermal resistivity\nvalues and heat fluxes can be obtained.\n\nMLI consists of several layers of plastic foil (poly-\nester or polyamide) separated by plastic nets to reduce\nheat conduction. In order to minimize the thermal\nradiation exchange the foils are coated on both sides\nwith aluminum (\u20ac < 0.025). The thickness of the foils\nis between 15 and 50m and of the coating about\n25nm. MLI exhibits its excellent insulation effect in\nvacuum, since heat conduction via gas is eliminated.\nThe foils are therefore perforated in order not to da-\nmage the MLI during evacuation and to reduce the\nremaining residual pressure, which should be below\n10\u00b0*Pa.\n\nThe emissivity of an evacuated MLI with n foils\nwhich do not touch each other (i.e., not considering\ngas and solid body conduction) can be expressed\ntheoretically by\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\n(4.3.33)\n\nwhere & and &, are the emissivities of the two foil\nsides.

For this particular case, insulation\nwith a microporous molecular structure of the type\nrecently developed for terrestrial application may be\napplied (vacuum insulation panels for the building\nindustry). The insulation is based on a powder-like,\nhighly dispersed silica with particles having only point\ncontact and additionally separated by a hardening\nagent (Figure 4.3.19). Consequently, solid body ther-\nmal conduction is very much reduced [4.3.13]. The\ndimensions of the remaining void volumes are smaller\nthan the main free path of the enclosed low-pressure\ngas, which practically eliminates any gas-based heat\nconduction. In addition, radiative heat transport is\nminimized through application of powder-like in-\nfrared opacifiers.\n\nIn fact, thermal tests have confirmed that the heat\nconductivity remains at a low and constant value of\nbarely 4mW/mK up toa gas pressure of about 10 mbar\n(Figure 4.3.20).\n\n2/24/09 3:41:02 PM\n",

Applications\nare embedded heat pipes in radiator panels (Figure\n4.3.27) and north-south connections in spacecraft\n(Figure 4.3.28).\n\nIn order to use thermal radiators more efficiently,\npayload components have been recently developed\nwith operating temperatures of 100-200\u00b0C. Since\nammonia\u2014aluminum heat pipes are not suited to this\ntemperature range, the development of water-copper\nheat pipes has been initiated [4.3.18]. This material\ncombination, with compatibilities as shown in Table\n4.3.5, operates in the desired temperature range (see\nFigure 4.3.24). The proven axial grooves are manufac-\ntured using a galvanic process, where copper is electro-\nplated on a negative form with external grooves. After\ndissolving the negative form in a chemical process, a\nthin-walled copper profile remains, which is inserted\ninto an aluminum profile to increase the strength\nof the heat pipe (Figure 4.3.29).

On\nthe one hand, the dimensions which are effective for\ncapillary action (pores, groove width) must be small\nto produce high capillary forces. On the other hand,\nthese dense structures produce large pressure losses\nin the fluid flow. In practice an optimum has to be\nfound during the heat pipe design phase. However, the\nresulting capillary force is in most cases very small and\noperation against the Earth\u2019s gravity is not possible.\nThis feature leads to the need to accurately level the\nspacecraft during system tests.\n\nThe so-called loop heat pipe (LHP) avoids these\nconstraints. According to Figure 4.3.30, the capillary\nstructure in these units is located only in the evapora-\ntor. Under heat input in the evaporator the generated\nvapor flows in a smooth, small tube to the condenser,\ncondenses there and returns as liquid in a second tube\ntoa reservoir which is an integral part of the evapora-\ntor. Because the capillary structure is locally restricted\nto the evaporator, it is possible to apply very small\npore sizes with high capillarity without producing\nundue high-pressure losses in the loop. Today\u2019s LHPs\n(Figure 4.3.31) are designed to operate with arbitrary\norientation to gravity with heat transport capabilities\nof 1-2kW.\n\nGuiding the fluid flow through separated tubes\nalso permits intelligent control of vapor flow as a\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:289\n\n289\n\nFigure 4.3.31: Loop heat pipe (Source: TAIS Ltd).\n\nHeat source\n\nEvaporator\n\nVapour\n\nHeat sink\n\nLagg g condenser\n\nFigure 4.3.32: Loop heat pipe with control valve.\n\nfunction of evaporator temperature. As shown in\nFigure 4.3.32, a control valve can be integrated into\nthe vapor line, which diverts the vapor flow into partial\nflows to the radiator and to the reservoir.\n\nThe valve (Figure 4.3.33) operates via an inte-\ngrated spring bellows against a control pressure which\ncan be adjusted to meet the control temperature se-\nlected at the evaporator. An increase of the evaporator\ntemperature above a preselected control value causes a\ncorresponding increase of the vapor saturation pres-\nsure and in turn a movement of the valve stem to open\nthe valve outlet for an increased vapor supply to the ra-\ndiator.

Thermal Surfaces\n\nAll visible surfaces of a satellite absorb or emit ther-\nmal energy and consequently influence the thermal\ncontrol system. Also important are the absorption of\nsolar energy and the emissivity in the infrared band.\nInside the spacecraft all surfaces are usually coated\nwith black paint (@= \u20ac= 0.8), in order to achieve a\ngood heat exchange by radiation.\n\nThe external visible layer of the MLI consists of\nKapton (DuPont\u2019s trade name for polyimide) with\nmedium absorptance and emission properties. So-\ncalled Beta cloth (a beta-silica\u2014fiber fabric) is applied\nin low Earth orbits, because Kapton would degrade\ndue to atomic oxygen.\n\nThe thermo-optical properties of radiator sur-\nfaces have a predominant influence on the thermal\ncontrol system. These surfaces should absorb low\nsolar energy under direct solar radiation, but must\nexhibit at the same time a large emitting capability\nin the infrared range. So-called second surface mir-\nrors (SSMs), which are also known as optical solar\nreflectors (OSRs), are employed. To achieve high\nemissivities they consist of translucent materials\n(quartz glass or Teflon) which are metallized on the\nbackside with highly reflective silver or aluminum to\ndecrease solar absorption (Figure 4.3.34).\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nReflected\nsolar radiation\n\nSolar radiation\n\nInfrared\n\nQuartz glass radiation\n\nor Teflon\n\nSilver layer\n\nAbsorbed\nsolar radiation\n\nFigure 4.3.34: SSM/OSR coating.\n\nTable 4.3.6: a and \u20ac values of commonly used thermal surfaces.\n\nProduct a \u00e9\nWithout With Without With\n\naging (5 years)\n\naging (5 years)\n\nQuartz SSM 0.08 0.2 0.8 0.8\nTeflon SSM 0.08 0.13 0.78 0.75\nWhite paint 0.26 0.44 0.88 0.88\nBlack paint 0.96 0.91 0.91 0.84\nPolyimide 0.4 0.67 0.7 0.73\n(Kapton)\n\nBeta cloth 0.24 0.35 0.88 0.88\n\nQuartz SSMs are manufactured as small tiles, si-\nmilar in size to solar cells (solar cell cover glass is also\nused for SSMs), whereas Teflon SSMs are installed\nas foil strips.

In a practical\napplication the east-west panels are equipped with\ndissipating equipment and connected via heat pipes. If\none side is exposed to the Sun, the louver blades close\nto avoid solar absorption. The heat pipes transfer the\nequipment heat losses to the opposite, shadowed side,\nwhere the radiator surface with open louver blades\nradiates the heat into space. Since heat pipes operate\nin both directions, the thermal control concept is ap-\nplicable to both spacecraft sides.\n\n4.3.4.5 Heaters\n\nHeaters are needed if a minimal thermal operating\nlimit for a component must be absolutely maintained\nand if its dissipation heat is inadequate, or if the heat\ncannot be absorbed by the solar radiation. A heater is,\nin principle, an electrical resistance. Current is con-\nducted through a thin wire with a specific resistance\nwhich converts electrical energy into heat. The heat-\ning wire, mostly consisting of copper, is embedded in\nthermoplastic foil for protection and insulation. Figure\n4.3.38 shows an assembly of such a heating element.\nAccording to their application, heaters are perma-\nnent in use, switched on/off by means of sensors, or\nelectrically controlled by varying the current which\nmaintains a constant component temperature. Ac-\ncording to [4.3.21], heaters are used in the following\nsubsystems:\ne Payload: As a heat source to compensate for va-\nrying operation conditions.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\ne AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control System):\nSensors are generally mounted at thermally ex-\nposed places of the satellite; heaters are required\nto maintain the operating temperature.\n\ne TMTC: Something similar (as for AOCS) applies\nto the antenna system of the Telemetry and Tele-\ncommand System.\n\ne Energy Supply: Batteries must maintain very\nnarrow temperature limits.\n\ne Propulsion System: Hydrazine systems need tem-\nperatures > 9\u00b0C, bipropellant and solid propellant\nengines at least 0\u00b0C. The complexity of tanks,\nengines and conduits makes heaters necessary.\n\nThe heaters can be switched on and off by ground\n\ncontrol. Temperature monitoring is performed via\n\ntelemetry and the control of the heaters by telecom-\n\nmanding. However, they can also be controlled auto-\n\nmatically on-board the satellite. The latter offers the\n\nfollowing possibilities:\n\ne Mechanical relays monitored by a microproces-\nsor.\n\ne Mechanical switches actuated by a bimetal sen-\nsor.\n\ne Electric switches operated in a closed loop control\nwith HCUs (Heater Control Units) or PCDUs\n(Power Control and Distribution Units).\n\nAn autonomous control loop normally has default\nsettings for controlling the heater. Changing thermal\nconditions sometimes require adjustment of the set-\ntings by telecommanding.\n\n4.3.5 Example of a Thermal Design\n\nTerraSAR-X is a German remote sensing satellite\nwhose primary payload is an active radar device. Its\nantenna acquires novel and high-quality X-band radar\ndata of the entire Earth. The satellite orbits the Earth\nat an altitude of approximately 514 kilometers in a\nSun-synchronous and nearly circular orbit. The choice\nof a dusk\u2014dawn orbit (18:00 local time for the ascend-\ning node) provides good conditions for the design of\nthe energy supply and thermal control systems: the\nsolar array surfaces are directed almost vertically to\nthe Sun, and eclipses occur only in the period around\n\n2/24/09 3:41:25 PM\n",

In the hot timeline, up\nto 70 data takes per revolution are to be made and for\nevery data take a three-stage warm-up sequence must\nbe run through. The hot operating design case deter-\nmines the maximum temperatures and therefore the\nlayout of the radiators in the nominal mode, whereas\nthe very limited operation of electronic components in\nthe safe mode serves for the layout of the heater system.\nAccording to technical properties, different thermal\noperation limits arise for bus and instrument units.\n\nA distinction is made between operational, nonop-\nerational and nominal limits. The operational limits\nmark the area in which electric or electronic assem-\nblies can be switched on without being damaged. By\nthe lower and upper nominal operation limit that\ntemperature range is meant in which an electric or\nelectronic instrument fulfills the functional require-\nments. The nominal limits usually correspond to the\noperational ones. The nonoperational limits apply to\nthe disabled state and to mechanical components. For\nsome electric or electronic assemblies, the latter are\nonly relevant for storage and transport because they\nare switched on or active during the whole mission\ntime, such as the on-board computer, the battery or\nthe solar panel.\n\nFor the heater layout and especially for deter-\nmining heater power within the scope of the thermal\nanalysis, the control values are initially set 10\u00b0C\nabove the lower operational or nominal limit to cover\nuncertainties in the calculation. During operations,\nhowever, the heater control values are set typically to\n3\u00b0C above the minimum operations limit. Now the\nthermal analysis with the node model must clarify\nwhether the temperatures are maintained in all nomi-\nnal load cases and operational scenarios within the\noperational or nonoperational limits relevant for the\nthermal control. The bar diagram depicted in Figure\n4.3.40 shows the result of this analysis for selected\nassemblies of the satellite that are in operation. The\nblack bar covers the area of the thermal prediction,\nwhile the allowed temperature range is marked by the\nred bars. The green area shows the uncertainty span\nto be taken into account for temperature prediction.\nIt can be seen that the uncertainty span of the lower\nlimit is about 3\u00b0C for heater-controlled assemblies\nbecause the temperature can be actively maintained.\nAn uncertainty span of 5\u00b0C applies for the remaining\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\ncomponents if their thermal behavior was sufficiently\n\nverified by testing. Otherwise, 10\u00b0C has to be allowed.\n\nAn overheating scenario is excluded, although too\n\nlong or too frequent use of the radar antenna might\n\ncause overheating.\n\nTogether with the thermal operational limits, some\ncomponents of course also have temperature stability\nand spatial gradient requirements.\n\nFigure 4.3.40 and Figure 4.3.41 show exemplarily\nthe predicted temperature variation of single thermal\nnodes in the hot load case over three revolutions. In\nFigure 4.3.40, the nodes represent electronic compo-\nnents of the radar device and in Figure 4.3.41 battery\nmodules and parts of the PCDU.\n\nOne can clearly recognize the strong temperature\nvariation of those units which are switched on and\noff in the time interval. However, components which\nare switched on permanently are characterized by a\nnearly constant temperature variation. In addition,\nthe temperature correlation is clearly visible between\nswitchable units and the battery or the PCDU. The\nenabling of electronic components leads to increased\nactivity of the PCDU and to a charge and discharge\nof the battery which results in the generation of ad-\nditional heat in both cases.\n\nOn the basis of the load cases, the given structure,\nbus and payload instruments and the thermal analy-\nsis, the following detailed thermal configuration was\ndesigned for TerraSAR-X:\n\ne Thermal insulation of the satellite by MLI and\nsuitable surface coatings at bus and instrument\nlevels.\n\ne Heat radiation into space by the use of foil radia-\ntors as shown in Figure 4.3.43. The surface ratio of\nMLI to foil radiators is chosen so that the average\ntemperature of the electronic units does not exceed\n30\u00b0C in the hot load case.\n\nThe external layer of the MLI exposed to space\nconsists of a Kapton foil coated with SiO, (yellow area)\nwith a ratio of a@/\u20ac = 0.34/0.62. MLI in the visibility\narea of the star sensors (black surface) has a black coat-\ning (@/\u20ac = 0.95/0.90) to minimize stray light effects.\nThe radiators (red surface) consist of an unperforated\nTeflon foil silvered on the inner side. It has a thickness\nof 127m and a ratio of @/\u20ac = 0.12/0.75. Thermally\nconducting silicone\u2014elastomer insulation is inserted\n\n2/24/09 3:41:28 PM\n",

However, this\nwould overload the battery, especially in the cold\nstate, and cause a very quick discharge which would\nagain endanger the boot sequence of the subsystem\u2019s\nessential assemblies (OBDH, On-Board Data Han-\ndling; AOCS, Attitude and Orbit Control System). In\naddition, the dissipating heat of the instruments can\nbe utilized to conserve heat power or energy. For this\nreason, the following warm-up steps with the cor-\nresponding configuration tables have been defined\nfor TerraSAR-X for the heater settings:\ne Table 1 with Survival/Safe limits (SURV)\ne Table 2 with Standby limits (NOM1)\ne Table 3 for Radar/XDA operation with operational\nlimits (NOM2)\ne Table 4 for Radar/XDA operation with nominal\nlimits (NOM3).\n\nIn the SURV table, the threshold settings of the\npropulsion system are increased to maintain the tem-\nperature of the flow valves for thrusters and propel-\nlant sufficiently above the lower limit. The threshold\nsettings in the NOM1 table initiate a warming up o\nthe battery and AOCS assemblies. The settings for the\nthruster valves and propellant are, however, decreased\nagain. Only in the NOM2 table are the operationa\nthreshold settings for the payload-relevant compo-\nnents raised. In the NOM3 table, nominal threshold\nsettings are defined to ensure better performance o:\nthe radar instrument and the X-band Downlink As-\nsembly (XDA).\n\nThe use of configuration tables for the control o:\nall 64 heater lines considerably simplifies the opera-\ntions on the ground because only one single command\nmust be executed to activate the table. The table can\nbe selected by choosing a formal parameter. Every\ntable contains the definition of the control thermis-\ntor, the control status, on and off thresholds, as well\nas the control frequency (LF, Loop Frequency) for\nevery heater line or for every row (line). The control\nfrequency can be set to either 1/32 or 1/16Hz by\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\ncommanding. The lower frequency is assigned to\ngroup 0 and the higher one to group 1.\n\nThe monitoring of the (sub)systems is done by\nmeans of a special telemetry system which processes\nthe measurements or housekeeping data and shows\nthem on alphanumeric, graphic and synoptic display\npages (combined display of graphic objects, texts\nand numeric values) (see Section 6.2). There are two\nalphanumeric pages for the display of the heater line\nsettings. Figure 4.3.45 shows the first page on which\nthe settings of the first 32 heater lines of the configura-\ntion table NOM1 are displayed in tabular form.\n\nTo clearly arrange the heater line activities for\nthe flight control, a display has been designed by\nthe thermal control engineer showing the switch\nstatus of the heaters and the measured temperatures\nsynoptically and groupwise. Figure 4.3.46 shows the\ninstantaneous status of the heater control system in\nthe thermal control mode NOM1. When the PCDU\nswitches on several heaters the corresponding graphic\nobject becomes blue.\n\nFor clarity, bus and instrument thermistors are\nsplit over two displays and again grouped into sub-\nsystems, assemblies or instruments. Figure 4.3.47\nshows the display page for the temperatures of bus\nthermistors.\n\nIt is often necessary to monitor temperature\nvariations for a short period on a real-time basis.\nTherefore, graphic display pages have been designed\nwhich plot the temperature variation of selected\nthermistors as a function of time. Figure 4.3.48 shows\nthe typical temperature variation at the battery which\nis caused by the control process, that is by switching\nthe heater on and off.\n\nThe recorded run of the control process in Figure\n4.3.48 is simulated. In reality, only 5 to 10 minutes are\navailable during contact for real-time telemetry.\n\nSometimes there are contingency situations requir-\ning the thermal control engineer to react appropriately\nto recover from a failure; that is, to find solutions or\nworkarounds so that the thermal control system oper-\nates properly again. This relates to the electric heater\nsystem because interventions are only possible from the\nground. The delamination of a part of the MLI from\nthe structure would be a possible scenario which could\ncause a thermal problem. However, direct intervention\nis not possible. Contingencies in the heater system can\n\n2/24/09 3:41:33 PM\n",

Significant differences will\nbe mentioned in the following sections.\n\n4.4.1 Fundamentals of Satellite\nPropulsion\n\nThe first satellites, such as Sputnik or Explorer, were\nnot equipped with propulsion systems. They were sta-\nbilized by rotation around their main axis, which was\nsufficient for the tasks they performed. But for the first\ngeostationary communications satellites, propulsion\nsystems were required for orbit and attitude control.\n\n4.4.1.1 Propulsion System Tasks\n\nDepending on the type and mission, propulsion sub-\n\nsystems have the following tasks [4.4.1], [4.4.2]:\n\ne Apogee Injection: The launcher carries the sa-\ntellite into an elliptical transfer orbit. In order to\nreach the final circular geostationary orbit, the\napogee engine with a thrust level of 400 to 600 N\nis activated in the apogee to move the satellite with\nthree or four orbit correction maneuvers into the\nrequired circular orbit.\n\n\u00a9 Orbit Control:\n\n\u2014 Drift initiation in the orbit plane in order to\nreach the target position (longitude) above\nEarth\n\n\u2014 Maintenance of the required position, east\u2014\nwest station keeping\n\n\u2014 Inclination control, that is the removal of an\ninclination of the orbit relative to the equato-\nrial plane, north-south station keeping\n\n\u2014 Injection into a \u201cgraveyard orbit.\u201d\n\nOrbit control is achieved by means of thrusters\n\nof 10 to 22N.\n\n2/24/09 3:41:45 PM\n",

A distinction is made\n[4.4.4] between spin stabilization and three-axis active\nstabilization.\n\nA spinning satellite rotates around its main axis\nat about 90 to 120 rpm, but lower spin rates of a\nfew revolutions per minute have been used as well.\nCommunications satellites such as Intelsat III to VI\nor the European Meteosat weather satellites were and\nare spin stabilized.\n\nThe thrusters for orbit and attitude control are\noriented either radially (acting through the center\nof gravity of the satellite) to be operated in pulsed\nmode, or axially (with an offset to the spin axis) to\nbe operated in steady-state mode, if the spin rate is\n\nsufficiently high.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nA three-axis actively stabilized satellite \u2014 today\u2019s\npreferred stabilization method \u2014 requires special po-\nsitioning and control effort for the orbit and attitude\nthrusters, but on the other hand allows the placement\nof antennas, instruments or solar arrays outside the\ncentral spacecraft body. Stabilization is achieved with\nreaction wheels in combination with the propulsion\nsystem, which controls the spin rate of the reaction\nwheels. Attitude control is described in more detail\nin Section 4.5.\n\n4.4.2 Propulsion System Types\n\nThe most frequently used propulsion systems are\ncold gas, monopropellant, bipropellant and, most\nrecently, electric propulsion systems. The selection of\nthe propulsion type depends to a great extent on the\ntype, size and mission of the spacecraft. Characteristic\nparameters are mass, propellant demand or \u201cdelta-v,\u201d\nreliability and mission lifetime. All figures shown in\nSections 4.4.2.1 to 4.4.2.3 below are simplified sketches\n(4.4.1), [4.4.2], [4.4.4].\n\n4.4.2.1 Cold Gas Propulsion\n\nIn the 1960s cold gas propulsion systems were pre-\nferred as standard reaction control systems [4.4.1],\n[4.4.2]. Cold gas propulsion is clearly the simplest\nand today the most cost-effective type of propulsion.\nInert, nontoxic gases stored under high pressure are\nused. Figure 4.4.1 (left) presents a simplified flow\nschematic consisting of a gas tank, pressure regulator\nand cold gas thrusters.\n\nn general, nitrogen or argon is used because of\ntheir low molecular weight. The pressure is reduced\nto the operating pressure of the cold gas thrusters by\nthe regulator. The thruster itself consists of a solenoid\nvalve and a nozzle, using the gas as propellant in pulse\nor steady-state mode. The most important task of cold\ngas propulsion systems on-board satellites is attitude\ncontrol. For very small or minisatellites compact\npropulsion systems using butane as propellant have\nbeen developed and flown.\n\nFor attitude control of launcher upper stages the\ngas in the launcher propellant tanks (e.g., a helium/\n\n2/24/09 3:41:46 PM\n",

Monopropellant propulsion\nsystems \u2014 initially hydrogen peroxide (H,O,) and,\nafter a suitable catalyst became available, hydrazine\n(N,H,) \u2014 led to the desired performance increase\nby a factor of 2 to 3 compared to cold gas [4.4.1],\n[4.4.2]. Figure 4.4.1 (right) presents the simplified\nflow schematic of a hydrazine propulsion system.\nIn the simplest case, propellant hydrazine and\npressurant nitrogen or helium are stored in the same\ntank, separated by a rubber diaphragm. The tank is\nconnected to one or more thrusters using an approp-\nriate tubing system, the thruster consisting mainly\nof a flow control valve, a heat barrier with injector,\na catalyst bed and an expansion nozzle. Due to the\nhigher performance (compared to cold gas), mono-\npropellant propulsion systems are used for orbit and\nattitude control; hydrazine thrusters, for example, can\nbe operated in steady-state mode as well as in pulse\nmode to deliver the required low impulse bits.\n\n4.4.2.3 Bipropellant Propulsion\n\nThe next step in the evolution of satellite propulsion\nentailed higher costs and increased complexity, but\ncompared to monopropellant systems yielded 25 to\n30% higher performance. Initially only considered for\nnorth-south station keeping and apogee injection,\nbipropellant propulsion systems are now also used\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:303\n\n303\n\nReduction valve Pump and\npressure\nreducer\nHigh-voltage\nelectronics\n\nElectric\nthrusters\n\nBipropellant thrusters\n\nFigure 4.4.2: Schematic of a bipropellant system (left) and an\nelectric propulsion system (right).\n\nfor attitude control as well because of the successful\ndevelopment of thrusters with low thrusts between\n10 and 22 N [4.4.1], [4.4.2], [4.4.4].\n\nBipropellant systems according to Figure 4.4.2\n(left) need at least two propellant tanks, one each for\noxidizer and fuel, as well as at least one high-pressure\nhelium tank with a pressure regulator. Bipropellant\nthrusters consist of two flow control valves (to con-\ntrol oxidizer and fuel flow), an injector, a combustion\nchamber and a nozzle.\n\n4.4.2.4 Electric Propulsion\n\nThrusters for electric propulsion systems use ioniz-\nable gases as the propellant. Though the development\nof electric propulsion was initiated about 30 years ago,\nthe first thrusters were flown in 1980 and 1990 by\nEurope and the USA (in the former USSR even much\nearlier) and have been in commercial use since 2000\n[4.4.26], [4.4.27]. They are primarily used for orbit\ncontrol and for north-south station keeping. For in-\nterplanetary probes or for missions to comets, electric\npropulsion is used as the main propulsion to achieve\na high Av(e.g., Deep Space 1, Hayabusa, SMART-1,\nBepiColombo). Because of its toxicity, mercury was\nreplaced by the inert gas xenon early in the develop-\nment. It is stored in high-pressure tanks, with the high\npressure reduced to the final operating pressure and\nfed to the engines by means of dedicated flow control\ndevices. Most of the electric propulsion systems have,\ncompared to chemical thrusters, a very low thrust\n\n2/24/09 3:41:46 PM\n",

As a\ndirect consequence, the required amount of propellant\nis drastically reduced. However, these engines must be\nqualified for much higher thrust durations and need\na relatively high amount of thrust-level-dependent\nelectrical energy, ranging from some hundred watts\nto several kilowatts, which has to be provided by the\nsatellite or probe.\n\nFigure 4.4.2 (right) presents the schematic of an\nelectric propulsion system.\n\n4.4.2.5 Solid Propulsion\n\nThrusters using solid propellants played a much re-\nduced role for satellites or probes. During the years\n1970 to 1990 their application was limited to apogee\nengines. Thereafter they were replaced by bipropellant\nthrusters, which allowed more efficient and accurate\ninjection into geostationary orbit because of their\nreignition capability, enabling apogee injection with\nthree or four consecutive maneuvers.\n\n4.4.2.6 Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nVarious parameters can be used to compare different\n\npropulsion systems:\n\ne Total mass (dry mass plus propellant and pres-\nsurant)\n\ne Electrical power demand,\n\ne Complexity and reliability\n\ne Chemical purity\n\ne Engine thrust levels.\n\nTable 4.4.1 contains the typical thrust levels required\nfor the different propulsion maneuvers.\n\nTable 4.4.1: Thrust levels.\n\nManeuver type Thrust [N]\nAttitude control <1to5\nOrbit control 10 to 22\nApogee/kick maneuver 400 to 500\nOrbit correction 10 to 500\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nDepending on the type of propulsion, the fol-\nlowing typical thrust levels can be achieved:\n\ne Cold gas: 0.1 to 2.0N\n\ne Monopropellant: 0.5 to 3000 N\n\ne Bipropellant: 10 to far more than 1000 N\n\ne Solid propulsion: 50 to far more than 1000 N\n\ne Electric propulsion: 0.001 N to several newtons.\n\nWhile the electrical power demand for chemical\npropulsion systems is very low, it is very high for\n\nelectric propulsion systems, which is decisive for the\nachievable thrust level and the specific impulse.\n\nThe decision on the type of propulsion system\nbest suited for a special application is determined\nby the specific impulse, which in turn determines\nthe propellant to be carried on-board the satellite or\nprobe (refer to Section 4.4.3). By means of the basic\nrocket equation, the required propellant mass can be\ncalculated using the velocity increment (Av in m/s)\nneeded for the entire mission and the specific impulse\nof the type of propellant considered:\n\nm, /m,=1-exp(-Ay/Ty)\n\nFigure 4.4.3 presents the ratio of propellant mass\nm, to satellite mass m,.\n\nAs an average value, about 65% of the complete\nsatellite mass at launch is stored propellant. The\nremaining 35% is used for the different satellite sub-\nsystems and the payload, while 5 to 6% is required for\nthe propulsion system hardware. As a consequence\nof the 65% propellant weight share of the total mass,\nthe different propulsion system types can only deli-\nver maximum velocity increments as presented in\nTable 4.4.2.\n\n1.20\n1.00 4\n=a cold gas,\n& 0.80 Monopropellant\n~, 0.60 | 9% Bipropetiant\n& 0.40 \u2014* Electrical\nOe 65% value\n0.20 |\n00 SOO SS wee\ns ss s ss\nPOPP HP HW ES LL SF\n\nAV {mis}\n\nFigure 4.4.3: Propellant to satellite mass ratio for different\npropulsion system types.\n\n2/24/09 3:41:48 PM\n",

But in such a case the total launch mass of the\nsatellite would amount to 2400 to 2500 kg.\n\nIna number of cases attitude control requires very\nsmall impulse bits to perform propellant-efficient\ncorrections around a satellite axis. This minimum\nimpulse bit is determined by the thrust level and the\nminimum firing duration of the thruster. Cold gas\nand monopropellant thrusters have a clear advan-\ntage because of the low thrust levels they are able\nto generate. But even bipropellant thrusters in the\n0 to 22 N range with fast-acting solenoid valves in\nthe order of 2 to 5 ms can fulfill the attitude control\nrequirements for small impulse bits, in particular for\nheavy communications satellites.\n\nFor science satellites with special requirements\nor chemical purity, cold gas systems are preferred\nor attitude control because contamination of optical\ninstruments or sensors by catalyst particles or unburnt\npropellant cannot be fully excluded for monopropel-\nant or bipropellant thrusters. Should monopropellant\nor bipropellant thrusters be mandatory because of the\nneeded velocity increment, the thrusters have to be\npositioned such that contamination can be minimized\nor even excluded.\n\nComplexity and reliability are other important\nparameters. The different propulsion systems are dis-\ncussed in detail in Section 4.4.6. The higher the num-\nber of components, the more complex the technology,\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:305\n\n305\n\nthe more difficulties exist in achieving the required\nreliability for long and demanding missions. The\nrequirement of high reliability can only be fulfilled\nwith the implementation of redundancies within the\nsystem and by extensive development and qualifica-\ntion testing on the component and system levels.\n\n4.4.3 Propellants\n\nBesides the design and optimization of the thrusters,\nthe choice of propellant determines the performance\nof a propulsion system. As well as the specific impul-\nse, density, freezing and boiling point, toxicity and\nstorability are parameters of importance. The main\nparameters for the most important propellants used\nfor chemical and electrical propulsion systems are\nsummarized in Table 4.4.3. For satellites with long-\nduration missions the fuel storage properties are of\ngreat importance [4.4.4], [4.4.20].\n\nCold Gas Propellants\n\nThe primary choice for cold gas systems is nitrogen\nsince it is easier to store compared to helium or hy-\ndrogen and less risky with respect to leakage because\nof its relatively large molecular size. In cases where\nnitrogen cannot be used because of special require-\nments of the scientific payload, argon might be a\nsuitable alternative.\n\nMonopropellants\n\nHydrogen peroxide (H,O,) \u2014 in high concentration\nalso known as HTP (High Test Peroxide) \u2014 was used\nin the early 1960s as a monopropellant. Structures\nmade of silver or platinum were used as a catalyst,\ndecomposing H,O, into water and oxygen in an exo-\nthermic process. The fundamental problem with such\npropulsion systems was the inadequate storability\nof H,O, for a long period of time. Even under very\nfavorable conditions, H,O, tends to decompose and\ncreates a continuous pressure increase.

Shell 405 guaranteed even for\nlong-duration missions a reliable and spontaneous\nexothermic decomposition of hydrazine, as 3N,H, =\n4NH; + N,, followed by an endothermic dissociation\nof NH; into hydrogen and nitrogen. In 1967 and 1968\nATS III and Intelsat III were the first satellites to be\nlaunched with hydrazine propulsion systems.\n\nFor the two US Viking Mars missions in 1975 a\nmodified hydrazine quality was developed. During\ntests with the braking engine of the descent stage,\nhydrogen cyanides were detected, which could have\nkilled any traces of life to be detected during the lan-\nding phase. These gases were created by the pyrolysis\nof aniline in the standard or monopropellant grade\nhydrazine. Therefore a drastic reduction of the aniline,\niron, water and carbon content led to the \u201chigh-purity\ngrade\u201d of hydrazine. The reduction of aniline had a\nfurther positive effect by largely improving the cold\nstart capability of the thrusters.\n\nBipropellants\n\nThe search for propulsion systems of higher perfor-\nmance was necessitated by satellites with increasingly\nhigher launch masses. Compared to monopropellant\nhydrazine, bipropellant propulsion systems further\nreduced the propellant mass by about 25%. From\na variety of different propellants, unsymmetrical di-\nmethylhydrazine (UDMH) and monomethylhydra-\nzine (MMH) were finally selected as fuel and N,O,\nas oxidizer. In the former USSR, UDMH was the\n\nprimary choice, while in the western world the thrus-\nters were developed with MMH as fuel. The Symphonie\nsatellites \u2014 the very first to use bipropellants \u2014 burnt\nAerozin 50 (50% hydrazine and 50% UDMH) in\ntheir orbit control thrusters and apogee engine. The\nfollow-on propulsion systems used MMH, which was\nmuch easier to handle.\n\nTo avoid stress corrosion defects in titanium pro-\npellant tanks, 1 to 3% of nitrogen oxide (NO) per\nweight by volume is added to the oxidizer N,O, (NTO\n= nitrogen tetroxide). This mixture is known as MON\n1 or MON 3 (MON = Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen) and\nis used in the 1% or 3% version in almost all bipro-\npellant propulsion systems.\n\nThrusters for electric propulsion require pro-\npellants which can be easily evaporated and ionized\nand which have a high molecular weight. Therefore\nin the years 1960 to 1990 mercury was the first choice\nfulfilling most of the above criteria, but it had to be\ndropped because of its toxicity. Thus the development\nof thrusters for electric propulsion concentrated on\nthe use of the colorless and odorless inert gas xenon,\nwhich can be stored in high-pressure gas tanks. Xenon\nhas a high molecular weight and can be quite easily\nionized.\n\nGreen Propellants\n\nUnder the name of \u201cgreen propellants\u201d investigations\nare underway to find new propellants for launchers as\nwell as satellite propulsion which are environmentally\n\n2/24/09 3:41:50 PM\n",

However, hydrogen peroxide or other green\npropellants such as butane, water or even laughing\ngas (N,O) (systems developed and flown by SSTL,\nUK) do not deliver performance comparable to that\nof hydrazine [4.4.21], [4.4.22].\n\nAn alternative propellant, which might be equal\nto or even better than hydrazine, is ADN (Ammo-\nnium Dinitramide). Thrusters for ADN have been\nin development at SSC (Swedish Space Corporation)\nsince 1997. This propellant is decomposed catalytically\nsimilar to hydrazine and has a 24% higher density and\na 6% higher performance, but at a higher decompo-\nsition temperature than hydrazine [4.4.23].\n\nHAN (Hydroxylammonium Nitrate) is also men-\ntioned as a promising candidate with a performance\nexceeding that of hydrazine. A corresponding thruster\ndevelopment is presently being undertaken in the\nUSA by Aerojet.\n\nWhether the advantages of green propellants are\nfinally sufficient to replace the reliable and efficient\nhydrazine propulsion systems can only be answered\nin the future.\n\nThe various materials used in propulsion systems\nare subjected to intensive screening and tests regarding\ntheir compatibility with the different propellants.\nDepending on the spacecraft mission, they are in\ncontact with these propellants in the liquid or vapor\nphase for up to 15 years or more at varying pressures\nand temperatures. This is valid for metallic materials\n(keyword: stress corrosion) as well as elastomers\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:307\n\n(keyword: catalytic/chemical properties). This subject\nis very complex and cannot be discussed here in any\nmore detail.\n\n4.4.4 Feed Systems and Propellant\nStorage\n\nAll propulsion systems mentioned in Section 4.4.2\nstore their propellants in tanks, from where they are\nfed to the thrusters.\n\nIn cold gas systems, the gas is stored in high-\npressure tanks at about 300 bar and is reduced by a\npressure regulator downstream of the tank to reduce\nthe pressure to the operating pressure of the cold gas\nthrusters, normally in the order of 1 to 5 bar.\n\nUnlike in cold gas systems, in monopropellant or\nbipropellant systems the propellant has to be actively\nfed from the tank(s) to the thrusters. In general, two\ndifferent principles are applied:\n\ne Expulsion in the blow-down mode (thereby re-\nducing pressure)\ne Expulsion at constant pressure.\n\n4.4.4.1 Blow-Down Mode\n\nExpulsion that continuously reduces pressure is known\nas the blow-down mode. The tank of the propulsion\nsystems using this method is filled with the propellant\n(e.g., hydrazine) and the pressurant gas, nitrogen or\nhelium, as presented in Figure 4.4.4 (left).\n\nAt the beginning of the mission (BOL) the pressu-\nre in the tank corresponds to the maximum operat-\ning pressure of the thrusters; for hydrazine thrusters\n\n2/24/09 3:41:51 PM\n",
    "329": "CHO04.indd Sec1:308\n\n308\n\nabout 22 to 30 bar. Propellant is expelled from the\ntank as soon as one or more thrusters are operated\nand the pressure in the tank decreases according to\nthe amount of propellant consumed. Corresponding\nto the decreasing tank pressure, the engine thrust\ndecreases as well. At the end of the mission (EOL) the\nremaining pressure in the tank should correspond to\nthe minimum operating pressure of the thrusters; for\nhydrazine thrusters this is in the order of 5.0 bar. To\nachieve this, the gas volume should amount to about\n25% of the entire tank volume. The thrusters have to\nbe capable of reliable and efficient operation over a\npressure range of 4:1, the so-called blow-down ratio.\nDuring the development of the attitude control algo-\nrithms, the continuously changing thrust and impulse\nbit values have to be considered; thruster performance\nis of course well known from the relevant acceptance\nand qualification tests. Blow-down systems are always\nreasonable when the propellant demand is not too\nhigh, otherwise the tank or tanks get too large or too\nmany tanks would be required.\nA special case of the blow-down concept is a sys-\ntem with repressurization as in Figure 4.4.4 (right).\nIt is advantageous in cases where, at a certain time in\nthe mission, a higher thruster performance (thrust\nlevel) is required but is not available because the tank\npressure and thus the thrust is reduced to levels not\nable to support this requirement.\nHelium or nitrogen is stored in an additional tank,\nwhich is released at a certain time in the mission by\nopening a pyrotechnic valve. This leads to a pressure\nincrease in the propellant tank, thereby increasing the\nthrust as well. The mission time for repressurization,\nand the volume and pressure of the additional tank,\nhave to be determined such that during repressuriza-\ntion the maximum operating pressure of the propel-\nlant tank, the thrusters and all the other components\nof the propulsion system are not exceeded [4.4.1].\n\n4.4.4.2 Expulsion at Constant Pressure\n\nWhile turbopumps are used to feed the propellants\nto the engines in launcher propulsion systems, this\nprinciple was not accepted for satellite propulsion for\nseveral reasons, though corresponding developments\nexisted in the past. One of the main reasons was the\nproblem of miniaturization of mechanical elements\nand their reliability over a period of 15 years.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nReduction valve\n\nBipropellant thrusters\n\nFigure 4.4.5: Pressure-regulated bipropellant system.\n\nIn a pressure-regulated propulsion system the\npropellant tanks are pressurized with helium or in\nrare cases with nitrogen out of a separate pressurant\ntank via a pressure regulator. With this method, the\npressure is kept at a constant value between BOL\nand EOL. This assures a constant propellant supply\npressure up to the thrusters over the entire mission.\nFigure 4.4.5 presents a typical configuration of a\npressure-regulated system of the type mainly used in\nbipropellant propulsion systems.\n\nDuring the launch campaign the propellant tanks\nare loaded to 95%. The remaining 5% is filled with\npressurant gas to about 4 bar, sufficient to tolerate\nthe maximum allowable pressure increase caused by\ntemperature increases.\n\nAfter the launch, the propellant tanks are pressu-\nrized to the nominal operating pressure of about 17\nbar. The pressure regulator has to keep the operating\npressure constant over the entire mission. This is\ntrue for long-duration interplanetary missions but\nnot for commercial communication satellites. The\nreason for this difference is explained in detail in\nSection 4.4.6.2.\n\nThe goal of pressure regulation is to maintain a\nconstant thrust and constant impulse bits at identical\nfiring conditions. The specific impulse is \u2014 neglecting\naging effects \u2014 constant as well. As the engines run\nclose to their optimum operating conditions, the spe-\ncific impulse is high and the propellant consumption\n\n2/24/09 3:41:52 PM\n",
    "330": "4.4 Satellite Propulsion\n\nlower than for operation in blow-down mode. This\nperformance optimization is, however, the result of\nincreased complexity, as demonstrated in Section\n4.4.6.2 [4.4.1]. An advantage of the pressure-regulated\nsystem is that the propellant tanks are only negligibly\nlarger than required to store the propellant.\n\n4.4.4.3 Propellant Storage\n\nTwo main aspects have to be considered when desig-\nning a propulsion system: which thrusters are availa-\nble; and which propellant tanks are available.\n\nNew developments should be avoided because\nof cost. The following section deals with the storage\naspects of the propellant.\n\nThe storage of gases or the propellant for electric\npropulsion (xenon) is relatively simple. In general,\nspherical tanks are used, which are designed for high\npressures up to 300 bar. They are mounted in the\nsatellite structure at their spherical poles with one\nfixed and one flexible bearing to allow for expansion\nduring pressurization. The tanks have only one port\nconnecting the tubing system for loading the gas and\nits withdrawal during the mission. In the past all-\ntitanium tanks were produced from the heat-treated\nalloy Ti6Al4V. In the meantime so-called composite\ntanks have been more frequently used because of\ntheir significant weight advantage [4.4.12], [4.4.18],\n[4.4.19]. They consist of a thin-walled titanium tank\ncalled a liner which is to a high extent leakproof. In the\npast this liner was wrapped with Kevlar; today Kevlar\nhas been replaced by carbon fiber materials (Figure\n4.4.6). After wrapping with the fiber material the tank\nis soaked in an epoxy resin and subjected to a thermal\ncuring process to achieve the required strength.\n\nThe storage of liquid propellant requires comple-\ntely different technologies compared to the storage\nof gases, as a zero-g environment has a significant\ninfluence on the orientation of the propellant.\n\nIn spin-stabilized satellites with a significantly\nhigh rotation speed, the centrifugal force will take\ncare of the propellant orientation, as presented in\nFigure 4.4.7.\n\nAlthough only two tank ports would be sufficient\nduring the mission of a spinning satellite, one require-\nment is not fulfilled by this design, namely the possi-\nbility of propellant unloading on the ground because\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:309\n\n309\n\nFigure 4.4.6: High-pressure composite tanks (carbon fiber or Kevlar)\n(Source: ASTRIUM).\n\n(.\\\n\nSpin axis\n\nfolio Ue\n\nFigure 4.4.7: Propellant orientation during spin.\n\nFigure 4.4.8: Giotto (teardrop) and MSG tank (Source: ATK PSI\nand ASTRIUM).\n\nof an aborted launch etc. This requirement can be met\nby a third propellant port displaced 90\u00b0 in the equa-\ntorial plane of the tank (as realized for the MSG tank,\nFigure 4.4.8 right) or by a very special tank design, the\nso-called teardrop tank (Figure 4.4.8 left), which was\ninstalled in the hydrazine propulsion system of the\n\n2/24/09 3:41:53 PM\n",

If properly installed in the spacecraft, the lower\ntank port can be used for propellant withdrawal for\nthe thrusters and for propellant unloading on the\nground [4.4.15], [4.4.18].\n\nFor nonspinning satellites or probes a propellant\norientation method has to be found which operates\nreliably under zero-g conditions. This method has to\nbe insensitive to disturbing torques and accelerations\ngenerated by the operation of the thrusters on-board\nthe spacecraft as well.\n\nOne solution for the orientation of propellants\nor the separation of the propellants and the pres-\nsurant gas is to use diaphragms or bladders inside\nthe propellant tank. They can always be used when\npropellant-compatible materials are available. While\nthis material is available for hydrazine, no suitable\nand long-time oxidizer-compatible materials have\nbeen developed.\n\nATK PSI Operations, USA, is the world\u2019s leading\ncompany for the development and production of\ndiaphragm tanks and has produced several thousand\ntanks during the last 50 years. On contract to the US\nAir Force, in the early 1970s TRW developed a hydra-\nzine-compatible material, AF-E-332, replacing the less\ncompatible material EPT 10. Diaphragms produced\nby ATK PSI for spherical tanks have a hemispherical\nconfiguration (Figure 4.4.9). Ribs on the inside impro-\nve the expulsion efficiency anda rib at the diaphragm\nequator is used for fixation in the tank equator.\n\nDuring final integration of the tank, the dia-\nphragm is installed in the lower hemisphere by means\nof a clamping ring; thereafter the upper hemisphere\nis installed and all three parts are connected in one\nsingle welding process.\n\nDiaphragm tanks (Figure 4.4.10) have several\nadvantages. Since they can be qualified for up to 100\nloading and unloading cycles, they can be easily tes-\nted on the component level as well as on subsystem\nand system levels. They prevent propellant sloshing\nto a great extent and are capable of orienting the\npropellant even at high disturbance torques and ac-\ncelerations. Regardless of whether the tank is filled to\n40% or 90% or whether the propellant port is located\nagainst Earth\u2019s gravity, the tank can be unloaded on the\nground and can be launched in this configuration. It\ncan even orient and feed the propellant to the thrusters\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFigure 4.4.9: Different-size diaphragms (Source: ATK PSI Opera-\ntions) [4.4.18].\n\nFigure 4.4.10: Diaphragm tank (Source: ATK PSI).\n\nunder disturbance torques. While the tank is emptied,\nthe diaphragm is reversed until its inner surface comes\ninto contact with the lower tank hemisphere. The\npropellant between the ribs is forced to the propellant\noutlet such that an expulsion efficiency of 99.5% can\nbe guaranteed.\n\nBut disadvantages exist for tanks with rubber\ndiaphragms. In particular, gas penetration and per-\nmeability have to be mentioned. Helium penetrates\nthe diaphragm material and dissolves in the propellant\nuntil helium saturation is achieved. Hydrazine vapors\ncan penetrate the diaphragm in the opposite direction\nand enter the pressurant part of the propulsion sys-\ntem. Therefore, even those components not directly\nin contact with the propellant should be hydrazine\ncompatible.\n\nFurthermore, the thermal control subsystem\nshould prevent hydrazine vapors from freezing and\nthereby endangering or damaging upstream com-\nponents.\n\n2/24/09 3:41:56 PM\n",
    "332": "4.4 Satellite Propulsion\n\nAn alternative to the diaphragm tank is the blad-\nder tank. The propellant is stored in a cylindrical\nbladder and the expulsion to the thrusters is achieved\nthrough a perforated tube in the center of the tank.\n\nAs for the diaphragm tank, the pressurant and the\npropellant are in the same tank. Again, to achieve a\nblow-down ratio of 4:1, the gas volume must be in the\norder of 25% of the total tank volume. If propellant is\nconsumed during the thruster maneuvers, the bladder\nwill fold itself around the central tube and expel the\npropellant with good expulsion efficiency.\n\nThe US company ARDE Inc. has specialized in\nthe development and production of propellant tanks\nwith metallic diaphragms. The major reasons for the\napplication of metallic diaphragms are as follows:\n\ne Long-term storage at very low or zero permeation\nrates.\n\ne Storage of propellants being incompatible with\ndiaphragms or bladders made from rubber.\n\ne Severe requirements concerning sloshing and\ncenter of gravity movement.\n\nA tank with a metallic diaphragm and, in the partial\ncut-away, the metallic diaphragm of the tank are\npresented in Figure 4.4.11.\n\nIn contrast to the rubber diaphragm, the metallic\ndiaphragm is equipped with concentric ribs which\nallow a continuous reversal of the diaphragm. Two\nsteps of the diaphragm reversal process are presented\nin Figure 4.4.12. The metallic diaphragm guarantees\ncomplete tightness between propellant and pressurant\nand is compatible with bipropellants as well, even\nthe oxidizer. It can achieve an expulsion efficiency\nof about 97%. One of the major disadvantages of\nthe metallic diaphragm is the fact that the reversal\ncan be performed just once. The consequence is that\nacceptance verification of a propulsion subsystem\ncannot include a diaphragm reversal. Launching with\npartially filled tanks can cause problems as well.\n\nAs a competitive alternative for diaphragm tanks\nfor applications involving monopropellant and bipro-\npellant propulsion systems, surface tension tanks have\nbeen developed [4.4.13], [4.4.15], [4.4.16], [4.4.17],\n[4.4.18]. The motivation for the development of this\ntype of tank was the fact that the satellites became\nlarger and heavier and required more efficient pro-\npulsion systems. The answer was to use bipropellant\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:311\n\n311\n\nFigure 4.4.11: Drawing and hardware of a metallic diaphragm tank\n(Source: ARDE Inc.)

Surface tension tanks\nare equipped with propellant management devices\n(PMDs) capable of continuously transporting the\npropellant to the tank outlet. These devices make use\nof surface tension forces in narrow gaps by means\nof vanes, sponge-like structures or traps and can be\nrefilled depending upon their design.\n\nThe design of the propellant management devices\n\ndepends upon factors such as:\n\ne Type of propellant (hydrazine, MMH, NTO)\n\ne Partial or complete fill level at launch\n\ne Horizontal transport of the launch vehicle on the\n\nground after propellant loading\n\ne The size of the disturbance torques and accelera-\n\ntions and their direction in orbit\n\ne The maximum flow rate during operation of the\nthrusters\n\ne Point in time and quantity of first propellant\nwithdrawal\n\n2/24/09 3:42:00 PM\n",

However, not only the availability of\na suitable tank, but all the other components in the\nhigh-pressure section of the propulsion system, like\nvalves or pressure reduction devices, determine the\nmaximum operating pressure.\n\nThe complete flow schematic of a cold gas system\nis presented in Figure 4.4.16.

The pressure\nregulator reduces the high pressure \u2014 300 bar, for\nexample \u2014 to the operating pressure of the cold gas\nthrusters, 1 to 5 bar. The required thrust level more\nor less determines the operating pressure in the low-\npressure section, as the thrust is proportional to the\ninlet pressure into the cold gas thruster. The cold gas\nthrusters of the Hipparcos satellite delivered a thrust\nof 20 mN at an operating pressure of 1.5 bar.\n\nA low-pressure transducer is located downstream\nof the pressure regulator to monitor the inlet pressure\nof the thrusters. This is important, if the regulated\npressure is not constant; its characteristics may de-\npend on the inlet pressure. The low-pressure section\nis protected against a failure of the pressure regulator\nby a relief valve which will open at a certain \u201cdelta-p\u201d\n(about 2 to 3 bar) above the nominal operating pressu-\nre and vent the gas.

To achieve a thrust of 20 mN at an ope-\nrating pressure of 1.5 bar, the throat diameter of the\nnozzle must amount to less than 0.3 mm.\n\nAs soon as the valve receives the electrical com-\nmand to open, a magnetic field is established which\nleads to a movement of the pintle. At a stroke of\nabout 0.3 mm, the gas passes the seal/seat area, leaves\nthe nozzle and, depending on the operational mode,\ncreates a continuous thrust or an impulse bit. As soon\nas the electrical activation is terminated, the valve is\nclosed by a spring. The force of the spring acts as a\nclosing force in the nonoperating condition to pre-\nvent the valve from leaking, pressing against a rubber\nseat/seal configuration.\n\nSolenoid valves have to be able to open and close\nwithin a few milliseconds, if very small impulse bits\nare to be achieved. Opening and closing response\ntimes in the order of 10 milliseconds and a thrust level\nof 20 millinewtons make minimum impulse bits of\n2-10\u2018 Ns possible. High-precision attitude control\nrequires the qualification of the thrusters for several\nmillion pulses and many hours of continuous opera-\ntion, such as for Hipparcos, which had to be operated\nsafely during the entire multiyear mission.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nLIES\nBPO shes\n\nSs y\n\n\\\n\nFigure 4.4.18: Cluster with four cold gas thrusters of the ASTRO-\nSPAS platform (Source: ASTRIUM).\n\nThese cold gas thrusters have been used for at-\ntitude control of the EURECA and ASTRO-SPAS\nplatforms (Figure 4.4.18) as well as for Hipparcos.\n\nCold gas thrusters with much higher thrust levels\nare used for roll control of the upper stages of laun-\nchers as well, conveniently using as propellants the gas\nfrom the propellant tanks as the operating medium.\n\nA special form of cold gas thrusters is known as a\nresistojet. Before leaving the nozzle, the gas is heated\nby electrical resistance heater elements. This increases\nthe enthalpy of the gas, leading to a higher exhaust\nvelocity, thereby increasing the specific impulse in\nthe order of 35 to 40%, and in turn reducing the\npropellant demand by this percentage. A prerequisite\nfor this increase in performance is the availability of\nelectrical power. The resistojet is described in Section\n4.4.6.1 as a special design of a hydrazine thruster, the\n\u201celectrothermal hydrazine thruster.\u201d\n\n2/24/09 3:42:09 PM\n",

The major disadvantage of hydrogen peroxide\nis that it tends to self-decomposition even under the\nbest storage conditions. In addition, this propellant\ndid not exist in today\u2019s purity and high concentra-\ntion. Therefore, the former propulsion systems had to\nbe equipped with relief valves, as described in Section\n4.4.5. These relief valves proved to be very unreliable\nand several satellites lost their propulsion systems due\nto failures of those valves. Of course one advantage of\nH,0, has to be mentioned.

A 100% dissociation of the ammonia would\ndecrease the specific impulse by about 18%.\n\nCatalysts for Hydrazine Decomposition\n\nThe breakthrough of hydrazine as a monopropellant\nis based on the successful development of the Shell\n405 catalyst by the Shell Company in 1961 [4.4.11].\nThe major requirement was an almost unlimited\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFigure 4.4.19: Catalyst grains Shell 405 (left) and KC 12 GA (right)\n(Source: ASTRIUM).\n\nspontaneous restart capability, high performance, and\ngood mechanical and thermal stability.\n\nAll presently applied catalysts use an Al,O, granu-\nlar material as carrier and iridium as catalyst. Most\nimportant is the distribution of the micro- and macro-\npores of the carrier itself. The carrier is delivered in\ndifferent grain sizes and is subjected to a mechanical\nrounding process to improve the abrasion resistance\nof the carrier and to allow better packing into the\ncatalyst bed. The final catalyst is achieved by multiple\nimpregnation steps in an iridium chloride solution.\nEach impregnation step is followed by a drying pro-\ncess. The number of impregnation steps is determined\nby the quantity of iridium (33 to 35% by weight)\nto be used for coating the catalyst grains. The final\nstep in the manufacturing process is reduction in a\nhydrogen atmosphere at a given temperature. To be\nable to handle the highly active catalyst, it has to be\ncarefully surface oxidized. Since 2003 the US catalyst\nfor all space applications has been manufactured by\nthe US company Aerojet.\n\nFigure 4.4.19 shows different catalyst grains in a\n100-fold magnification as seen by a scanning electron\nmicroscope.\n\nTo reduce the dependency of the European pro-\nduction of hydrazine thrusters on US products, the\nGFW (today DLR) decided in 1972 to initiate the\ndevelopment and production of a German catalyst\n[4.4.9]. The following companies and institutes par-\nticipated in this development:\n\ne Kali Chemie in Hanover\n\ne ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH in Bremen (to-\nday ASTRIUM GmbH ST)\n\ne The DLR at Trauen.\n\n2/24/09 3:42:14 PM\n",
    "338": "4.4 Satellite Propulsion\n\nThe Kali Chemie Company developed the catalyst\nwith the designation KC 12 GA. It was subjected to\nvarious tests by DLR-Trauen to investigate and verify\nits reactivity and stability. The final qualification of\nthe catalyst in three different thrusters of 22, 0.5 and\n2.0 N thrust was performed by ERNO.\n\nToday this catalyst is known as H-KC 12 GA and\nis produced by the German company W.C. Heraeus of\nHanau. This company also produces a ruthenium/iri-\ndium catalyst for space applications. This means that\nall types of space-qualified catalysts used in Europe\nare produced by W.C. Heraeus.\n\nBesides the two catalysts mentioned above, CNES\nand ESRO (today ESA) initiated the development of\nthe so-called CNESRO catalyst, which was exclusive-\nly used in thrusters produced by the SEP Company\n(today Snecma Moteurs). Neither the catalyst nor the\nthruster is manufactured any more.\n\nThis section discussing the properties of catalysts\nshould not be concluded without mentioning the\ndifferent damaging mechanisms. Damage means\nthe reduction or in the worst case the complete loss\nof catalytic activity. Whether the following damage\nwill really occur depends to a great deal on the quality\nof the design of the catalyst bed(s), on the catalyst\nloading process and on the operating modes and\nconditions during the mission:\n\nDamage can be caused by:\n\ne Generation of voids in the catalyst bed during\nacceptance and launch vibration\n\ne Loss of iridium on the active surface\n\ne Breakup of catalyst grains due to high thermal\nstress\n\ne Compacting of the catalyst.\n\nHydrazine Thrusters\n\nUsing the cross-section schematic shown in Figure\n4.4.20, the function of a hydrazine thruster is exp-\nlained in the following [4.4.5], [4.4.6], [4.4.7].\n\nAt the beginning one remark should be made.\nContrary to bipropellant thrusters, where a chemical\nreaction between two propellant components takes\nplace \u2014 oxidizer and fuel \u2014 monopropellant thrusters\ndo not have a combustion chamber but rather a\ndecomposition chamber.\n\nUpon opening the solenoid valve \u2014 the flow control\nvalve (not shown in Figure 4.4.20) \u2014 the propellant\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:317\n\n317\n\nInjection head \u00a9 Expansion\nInjection tube nozzle\n\nbarrier\n\nchamber\nMounting Crimp\nflange region\n\nFigure 4.4.20: Cross-section of a 2.0 N hydrazine thruster (without\nvalve) (Source: ASTRIUM).\n\nhydrazine passes the capillary tube into the injection\nhead. For engines with a very low thrust level, this ca-\npillary tube has a very low internal diameter of 0.1 to\n0.2 mm and is bent in an S-shape or even a complete\ncoil. This supports the flow calibration and gives the\ntube a certain flexibility to overcome stresses induced\nby the severe temperature gradients between the inlet\nside and the injector head. The capillary tube is fixed\nto the heat barrier on the left and to the injection head\non the right by high-temperature brazing or welding\nin vacuum.\n\nThe complete unit consisting of heat barrier,\ncapillary tube and injection head is subjected to a\nflow calibration in order to achieve a thrust level\ntolerance of 3%. A possible method is to reduce the\ncross-section of the capillary tube in the crimp area by\nmeans of a special tool. Simultaneously the flow rate\nis measured and the process is completed as soon as\nthe predefined flow rate has been achieved.\n\nThe configuration of the injection head of the\n2.0 N thruster in Figure 4.4.20 looks like a showerhead\nwith several injection bores and forms an integral part\nof the injector plate. These bores are equally spaced, so\nthat when the injected propellant hits the front of the\ncatalyst bed it is as uniformly distributed as possible.\nInjection head and catalyst bed are separated by a\nhemispherical screen. This screen and the appropriate\nlocation of the bores prevent catalyst fines from ente-\nring and blocking one or more of these bores.\n\nAs can be seen in Figures 4.4.20 and 4.4.21, the\nthruster has two catalyst beds of different grain sizes,\nwhich again are separated by an appropriately sized\nscreen. The grains in the first catalyst bed where the\n\n2/24/09 3:42:16 PM\n",

In the second catalyst bed the\necomposition of the hydrazine is completed, but\nthe partial dissociation of ammonia also takes place.\nFor the dimensioning of the catalyst beds a possible\negradation has to be considered, in particular the\nreduction of the active surface of the upstream bed\nuring the mission. The decomposition front will\nmove toward the middle screen. The length of the\nlownstream bed can therefore not only be sized on the\nbasis of a minimization of the ammonia dissociation\n(as short as possible), but also take the functional\nlifetime and the mission duration into account.\n\nA characteristic value in the design of the catalyst\nbeds is the bed loading, which is in general determi-\nned by the maximum flow rate divided by the cross-\nsection of the decomposition chamber. Typical values\nare between 0.015 and 0.060 g/(s mm).\n\nDuring thruster operation, the maximum decom-\nposition chamber temperature can be in the order of\n950 \u00b0C. The decomposition products expand through\nthe bell-shaped nozzle depending on the operational\ncase, the steady-state or pulse mode.\n\nThe thrusters presented in Figure 4.4.22 are ready\nfor flight, equipped with a flow control valve, catalyst\nbed heaters and a thermocouple. The thruster on the\nright is provided with a thermal insulation wrapping\nto minimize heat loss during the heating up of the\ncatalyst bed and to protect the environment of the\nthruster from the heat generated during thruster hot\nfiring [4.4.3], [4.4.6].\n\nThe catalyst bed heaters keep the catalyst at a\nstart-up temperature between 150 and 200 \u00b0C pri-\nor to firing, to avoid extreme cold starts with high\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFigure 4.4.22: Two 5.0N hydrazine thrusters (Source:\nASTRIUM).\n\ntemperature gradients and to prevent the catalyst\nfrom damage. However, the thrusters can operate\nfrom ambient temperatures and have been qualified \u2014\ndepending on mission requirements \u2014 to the required\nquantity of cold starts.\n\nElectrothermal Hydrazine Thrusters and Arcjets\nThe efforts to reduce the propellant mass led to thrus-\nters for which the enthalpy of the decomposition pro-\nducts was increased by raising the temperature of the\nexhaust gases. Higher exhaust gas temperature means\nincreased exhaust velocity, resulting in an improved\nspecific impulse.\n\nThe US company Aerojet [4.4.8], [4.4.10], [4.4.24]\nwas very successful in developing electrothermal\nhydrazine thrusters and hydrazine arcjets. Figure\n4.4.23 shows the electrothermal hydrazine thruster\nMR-501B, which is similar to the above-mentioned\nresistojet of cold gas propulsion.\n\nThe thruster consists of a hydrazine gas generator\n(in Figure 4.4.23, left) and a chamber with an inte-\ngrated resistance heater and the exhaust nozzle (in\nFigure 4.4.23, right). The gas generator decomposes\nthe hydrazine catalytically in the same way as in the\nhydrazine thruster. Instead of directly leaving the\nthruster, the decomposition products are heated up\nby the resistance heater in the second chamber to a\ntemperature of about 2000 K before they reach the\nnozzle.\n\nThe thruster delivers a thrust of 0.37 to 0.18 N\nat a blow-down ratio of 3.5:1.

With an electrical power\ninput of about 500 W, the thruster delivers an Ip of\n2940 N s/kg.\n\nFor the operation of the thruster, electronic cir-\ncuitry is required to limit the current drawn by the\nresistance heater to 30 A, until the operating tempe-\nrature is reached.\n\nFigure 4.4.24 presents the Arcjet MR-510 including\nelectronics and power cable.\n\nThe design of the arcjet thruster is similar to the\ndesign of the electrothermal hydrazine thruster: a gas\ngenerator is used for this system as well to produce the\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:319\n\n319\n\ndecomposition products. The heating of the gases is\nnot performed by a resistance heater but in the light\narc of an arcjet. An electrical power of 1 to 2 kW is\nnecessary to produce a thrust level of 200 to 300 mN.\nA satellite providing this amount of power can take\nadvantage of thrusters with a specific impulse up to\n6000 N s/kg.\n\nThe development of an arcjet thruster needs skills\nin the design of standard hydrazine thrusters and pow-\ner electronics. Because of the high temperatures in the\narcjet \u2014 in the arc the temperature reaches 10 000 K\n\u2014the aspects of material selection and thermal control\nare of utmost importance.\n\nHydrazine Propulsion Systems\n\nMonopropellant propulsion systems with hydrazine\nas propellant have been used with increasing suc-\ncess since the 1970s. Depending on the scientific or\ncommercial application and the mission lifetime, the\nimplementation of redundancies leads to systems of\nquite different complexity.\n\nThe first commercial application of the Shell\n405 catalyst took place for the 22 N thrusters of the\nspin-stabilized Intelsat III satellite. This satellite\nwas developed and produced by TRW (today Nor-\nthrop Grumman). The German company ERNO\nRaumfahrttechnik GmbH (today Astrium GmbH)\nelivered two complete hydrazine propulsion systems\nFigure 4.4.25).\n\nDespite redundancy (two identical half-systems)\nhe Intelsat III propulsion system is not very complex.\nEach of the two half-systems comprises an axial and\na radial thruster, a fill and a drain valve for loading\nor unloading hydrazine, a pressure transducer and a\n\nct\n\nfilter. The two half-systems are interconnected by a\nnormally closed pyrotechnic valve, separating them\nduring a nominal mission.\n\nIf a thruster fails the redundant half-system can\nstill fulfill the mission. By opening the pyrotechnic\nvalve the propellant from the half-system with the\nfaulty thruster can be used by the redundant half-\nsystem. This of course is only possible if the faulty\nthruster is not leaking.\n\nFigure 4.4.26 presents the flow schematic of the\npropulsion system of the ECS and MARECS satellites,\nthree-axis-stabilized communications or weather\nsatellites.\n\n2/24/09 3:42:19 PM\n",

The Ariane 5 SCA (Syst\u00e9me\nde Contr\u00e9le d\u2019Attitude) uses six to eight hydrazine\nthrusters with a thrust level of 400 N.\n\n4.4.6.2 Bipropellant Propulsion Systems\n\nLooking at chemical propulsion systems, bipropellant\npropulsion delivers the highest performance [4.4.1],\n[4.4.3]. This is true for the propellant combination\nLH,/LOX, as described in Section 3.3. For satellite\npropulsion, the propellants MMH and N,O, are best\nsuited due to their excellent storability and good\nperformance. The propellant characteristics are sum-\nmarized in Table 4.4.3. MMH reacts hypergolically\nand ignites spontaneously once in contact with N,O,;\nno special igniters are necessary. This attribute gives\nbipropellant engines the capability of pulse mode\noperation with very short pulse widths substantially\nlower than 10 milliseconds.\n\nBipropellant Thrusters\n\nWhile for monopropellant thrusters the layout of\nthe catalyst bed and the catalyst loading are of major\nimportance, the challenge for bipropellant thrusters\nis the design of the injector and the combustion\n\n2/24/09 3:42:23 PM\n",

Furthermore, major\nactors influencing performance, stability and service\nife of the thruster are adherence to the mixture ratio,\nefficient mixing of oxidizer and fuel, and cooling of\nthe injection head, combustion chamber walls and\nnozzle throat.\n\nThe adiabatic flame temperature for MMH and\nN,O, exceeds 3000 K. Therefore the cooling of the\nthruster is of great importance. Cooling methods\napplied in thrusters used for satellite propulsion are:\ne Film cooling\ne Radiation cooling\ne Regenerative cooling.\n\nThe last method is no longer customary. The present\ngeneration of thrusters uses a combination of film\nand radiation cooling methods.\n\nBecause of the high temperatures and the aggres-\nsive propellants, above all of the oxidizer, the selection\nof appropriate combustion chamber materials has\na big impact on thruster performance and life. The\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:321\n\n321\n\nfollowing processes and materials are used for pro-\ntection of the inner wall of the combustion chamber\nagainst oxidation:\n\n(a) Columbium with a complete silicide coating\n\n(b) Platinum without any coating\n\n(c) Rhenium with an iridium coating produced by\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD).\n\nEvaluating the above processes or materials, the fol-\n\nlowing can be stated:\n\ne Material and processing according to (a) have the\nlowest potential but have been in use for more\nthan 50 years.\n\ne The material according to (b) is the most reliable\nwith a maximum thermal capability of 1600 K\nwithout any coating.\n\ne The material and processing according to (c) have\nthe highest potential with a maximum thermal\ncapability of more than 2000 K. An increase in the\nspecific impulse of over 5% is possible.\n\nFor the propellant combination N,O,/MMH the\noptimum mixture ratio with the highest specific\nimpulse amounts to 1.65. A very accurate individual\ncalibration of the oxidizer and fuel flow rates by means\nof orifices, as shown in Figure 4.4.28, is of utmost im-\nportance. Due to the different densities of N,O, and\nMMH, this mixture ratio has the advantage of resul-\nting in identical tank sizes for oxidizer and fuel, thus\navoiding the development of different tank sizes.\n\nThe different functions of satellite propulsion\nsystems were presented in Section 4.4.1.1. Present\nsystems are designed for orbit and attitude control\nand apogee injection. The thrust levels for these tasks\nare quite different. Apogee injection is performed\nwith 400 to 600 N thrusters, while orbit and attitude\ncontrol make use of 1 to 22 N thrusters.

Delivering a vacuum thrust of\n10 Nata specific impulse of 2855 N s/kg it belongs to\nthe smallest high-performance thrusters of its kind. It\nis equipped with two valves as is more or less standard\ntoday. The upstream valve is a bistable latching valve\nwhich can isolate the thruster from the rest of the\npropulsion system either on the ground or during any\nphase of the mission. The downstream valve is a mo-\nnostable solenoid valve which controls the propellant\nflow to the thruster in the steady-state or pulse mode.\nIn the present case both valves are integrated into one\nsingle body (see Figure 4.4.31, right).\n\nA typical operational range for oxidizer and fuel\ninlet pressures is presented in Figure 4.4.32.\n\nFor the qualification of a 10 N thruster an exten-\nsive test program has to be performed in the steady-\nstate mode (up to 60 hours of continuous firing) and\nin pulse mode operations (up to 10\u00b0 pulses with va-\nrious on/off times including negative pulses) thereby\nverifying the diagram of Figure 4.4.32.\n\nBipropellant Propulsion Systems\n\nThe German/French Symphonie communications sa-\ntellite was the first to be equipped with a bipropellant\npropulsion system [4.4.3] (see, e.g., Figure 4.4.33).\nHowever, the apogee engine and the orbit control thrus-\nters were still components of two independent propul-\nsion systems.

It was first\ndesigned and produced for the German/French com-\nmunication satellites TV-SAT and TDF. The word\n\u201cunified\u201d is explained by the fact that the apogee\nengine and the orbit and attitude control thrusters get\ntheir propellant from the same tank system.\n\nBipropellant systems (see Figure 4.4.34) with\nmore than 2000 kg of propellant designed for today\u2019s\ncommunications satellites use about 80% for the\napogee injection. In the transfer phase, that is prior to\nand during the apogee maneuvers, they are pressure\nregulated, taking the helium pressurant from one or\nmore gas tanks (helium tank).\n\nPressure regulation to achieve the operating pres-\nsure of the thrusters is performed by a pressure\nregulator (PR1). State-of-the-art pressure regulators\nhave built-in redundancy (see Figure 4.4.42) and\nconsist of two units in series. During launch the\npressure regulator is protected by a normally closed\npyrotechnic valve (PV1). Downstream of the tanks\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:323\n\n323\n\nare two normally closed pyrotechnic valves (PV4/5)\nwhich act on the ground as mechanical inhibitors for\nsafety reasons, as required by most launch authorities.\nAfter pressurization of the tanks and opening of all\nnormally closed pyrotechnic valves, the propulsion\nsystem is ready for operation. The first major ma-\nneuvers are for apogee injection. Due to the pressu-\nre-regulated mode the operational conditions for all\napogee maneuvers are identical. As soon as the satellite\nhas reached its geostationary orbit, the two normally\nopen pyrotechnic valves (PV2/3) are closed and the\ncomplete pressure supply system is isolated from the\nremaining propulsion system. As a consequence all\nsubsequent orbit and attitude control maneuvers are\nperformed in a blow-down mode. As a large quantity\nof propellant has been withdrawn from the propellant\ntanks because of the apogee injection and are now\nfilled with helium, the blow-down ratio is quite low,\nnormally less than 2:1.\n\nThe thrusters of the propulsion system shown\nin the schematic of Figure 4.4.34 are equipped with\nmonostable solenoid valves only. Therefore the two\nbistable latching valves (BLV 1/2) installed in front of\neach thruster branch act as a third barrier, together\nwith the two normally closed pyrotechnic valves\n(PV4/5) for ground safety. Should the thrusters be\nequipped with dual-seat valves as shown in Figure\n4.4.31 (right), these latching valves can be omitted.\n\nThe two propellant tanks of the propulsion sys-\ntem presented in Figure 4.4.33, with tank shapes as\ndepicted in Figure 4.4.15, are integrated in the central\ncompartment of the satellite. The 10 N thrusters are\ninstalled at their individual positions according to\ntheir function, with the apogee engine installed under\nthe lower platform together with the helium tank.\nSome of the 10 N thrusters for orbit control can be\nused as redundancy for the apogee engine. They are\nqualified for the very high firing durations required\nin such a failure situation.\n\nDual-Mode Propulsion System\n\nDual-mode propulsion systems combine the high\nperformance of bipropellant apogee engines with the\nreliability and simplicity of monopropellant systems.\nConsequently, hydrazine is used as propellant instead\nof MMH.

MON/N,H, is a critical\npropellant combination, primarily because of the\nmuch lower temperature limit for thermal decompo-\nsition of the hydrazine fuel compared to MMH. This\ncomplicates drastically the development of such dual-\nmode engines (Figure 4.4.35).

However, the power as well as the\nthrust are limited by the available electrical energy\ndelivered by batteries, solar generators or radioisotope\nthermoelectric generators (RTGs).\n\n4.4.7.1 Thruster Types and Function\n\nThree following main technology groups can be iden-\n\ntified [4.4.26], [4.4.27], [4.4.28]:\n\n325\n\ne Electrothermal propulsion\ne Electrostatic propulsion\ne Electromagnetic propulsion.\n\nElectrothermal thrusters were described in Section\n4.4.6.1. The design and function of electrostatic and\nelectrodynamic thrusters are described in the fol-\nlowing.\n\nFor electrostatic thrusters the three main tech-\nnologies using xenon as a propellant are described in\nthe sketches of Figure 4.4.36.\n\nIn electrostatic thrusters the acceleration is caused\nby electrostatic potentials. Examples are the ion engi-\nnes (types RIT, Kaufman or Hall effect), the colloidal\nthruster and the field emission thruster (type FEEP).\nThe ionization can be performed by means of DC\ndischarge, radiofrequency or electron synchrotron.\nThe positively charged particles need to be neutralized\nby adding electrons outside of the acceleration zone.\n\nIn the RIT (Radiofrequency Ion Engine) (Figure\n4.4.36, left), described for the first time by Horst L\u00e9b\nin 1962, the plasma is generated without the use of\nelectrodes by means of a high radiofrequency field.\nThis avoids the use of life limiting hollow cathodes\nwithin the discharge vessel. The acceleration of the\nions is achieved by a grid system using a high-vol-\ntage potential in the range from 1200 to over 2000 V.\nOutside of the grid system, electrons are added by a\nneutralizer in order to neutralize the ion beam, thus\navoiding the charging of the satellite structure. In total\ntwo xenon feed lines are required, one for the thruster\nand one for the neutralizer. Thrusters of the RIT type\ncan achieve specific impulse values a factor 10 to 20\ntimes higher than those of chemical propulsion sys-\ntems. The specific impulse amounts to greater than\n35 000 N s/kg at thrust levels between 0.1 and 250 mN.\nARIT-10 operated at 15 mN after a launcher injection\n\nPropulsion 7 = |\nsystem 7 i\nPropuleh R) yster are\" ye @ Propulsion 7 \u2122\npulsion xenon inlet system \u201c. i\nsystem 2 ~ xenon : o iy\nxenon inlet \u201d i inlet 4\u00bb\nGs \u2014 ge n 4\nL_mee = te\n* \u201d Cathode /$\nxenon \u00ab{ / ; 7\nFigure 4.4.36: Design of radio- Neutralizer _ inlet Neutralizer Neutralizer\nfrequency, Kaufman and Hall xononinet xenon inlet\neffect thrusters. inlet\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:325\n\n4\n\n2/24/09 3:42:39 PM\n",

Ina\nKaufman thruster (Figure 4.4.36, middle) the plasma\nis generated by a plasma discharge between a hollow\ncathode and an anode. As in the RIT the ions are acce-\nlerated by a DC grid system. A magnetic field confines\nthe plasma to increase ionization efficiency. In contrast\nto the RIT system, three xenon feed lines are required,\ncreating more complexity for the thruster design and\nthe overall system. Kaufman engines from the L-3\nCorporation are used on the Boeing Space Systems\nsatellite buses 601HP and 702. In addition, a 30 cm\ntype was successfully used as primary propulsion for\nDeep Space 1 and is now being used on Dawn.\n\nBoth thrusters of RIT and Kaufman type are\ncharacterized by a very narrow ion exhaust plume\nangle of 25\u00b0.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nThe field emission thruster (FEEP) is another ad-\nvanced electrostatic thruster using liquid metal ions to\ndeliver very low thrust levels in the micronewton range\nat high specific impulses in the range of 60 000 N s/kg.\nIn addition it allows thrust control with very high\naccuracy at very low thrust roughness. However, it\nrequires high quality with respect to chemical purity\nand vacuum.\n\nThe low thrust levels make this technology a first\nchoice for applications requiring an undisturbed\nmicrogravity environment or very accurate maneuve-\nring between two satellites. The needle design, using\nindium as a propellant, consists of an emitter with\nan indium reservoir and a tungsten needle with a tip\nsharpness of a few micrometers.\n\nAnother FEEP technology uses cesium as a propel-\nlant that is transported by capillary forces between two\nvery sharp, nearly parallel blades having a thickness\nof about 1 jm at the end (Figure 4.4.38).\n\nFor both FEEP types the emitters are supplied\nby a high positive potential of 3 to 12 kV. The high\npotential causes the liquid metal to form a so-called\nTaylor cone that has a very sharp tip with an extreme\nfield strength of over 100 V/m. The acceleration of the\nions is achieved with an extractor electrode that is at\na potential of 1 kV. The resulting ion beam delivers a\nthrust between 0.1 and 300 ,N [4.4.31].\n\nHall Effect Thrusters\n\nIn a Hall effect thruster (HET) or stationary plasma\nthruster (SPT) (Figure 4.4.36, right) xenon ions are\naccelerated by a DC field as well; however, contrary to\nthe RIT or to the Kaufman thruster, not only accele-\nration grids but also the potential difference between\nthe anode at the bottom of the circular discharge\nvessel and the external cathode in the range of a few\nhundred volts are used. Ionization is performed by\na DC discharge between anode and cathode within\nthe circular discharge vessel. By means of a magnetic\nfield the electrons are trapped and accelerated in the\ndischarge vessel to increase the ionization efficiency\nand form a Hall current. The heavy ions are not af-\nfected by this magnetic field.\n\nHETs of different sizes can deliver thrust levels\nbetween 20 and 1000 mN. For example, the SPT100\nmanufactured by the Design Bureau Fakel in Kali-\nningrad with an electrical power consumption of\n\n2/24/09 3:42:40 PM\n",

In contrast to the\ngridded ion thruster, the ion beam of an HET has a\nrelatively unfavorable divergence angle of 45\u00b0 half\nangle [4.4.30].\n\nBased on the ideas of A. Morozov, the development\nof the HET was started in the 1960s in the former\nUSSR at TsSNIIMASH and the Keldysh research center.\nFakel was responsible for the industrialization. More\nthan 200 HETs are operating in space.\n\nESA\u2019s Moon mission SMART-1 was propelled from\nGTO into lunar orbit by a PPS 1350 from Snecma\nMoteurs (Figure 4.4.39).\n\nElectromagnetic Propulsion\nIn the low-thrust range, pulsed plasma thrusters\n(PPTs) provide extremely low impulse bits with a pulse\nfrequency depending on the available power to charge\nthe capacitor. The PPT system produces short energy\npulses that vaporize, ionize and accelerate the solid\npropellant, normally Teflon (Figure 4.4.40).\n\nDue to the pulsed operation with a frequency of\n1 Hz or less, the average power demand is only a few\nwatts. The energy is stored in a capacitor for about a\nsecond; after ignition the pulse length is only a few\nmicroseconds. The capacitor is then recharged during\nthe times between pulse ignitions.\n\nMagnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters\n\nOn the high-power side from tens of kilowatts to\nmegawatts magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrus-\nters may be used for future human space exploration\nmissions. In Germany MPD thrusters are under in-\nvestigation at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at\nStuttgart University.\n\nThe MPD thrusters use the Lorentz force (a force\nresulting from the interaction between a magnetic\nfield and an electric current) to generate thrust.\n\nIn the 100 kW to 1 MW range the magnetic field\nthat forms the magnetic nozzle to accelerate the ions\nis generated by the interaction of the DC discharge\nbetween the cathode and anode. This type is called\nthe MPD self-field thruster.\n\nIn the lower power range from 10 to 30 kW the\npower is too weak to generate by itself a magnetic field\nfor the generation of a magnetic nozzle. Consequently,\na magnetic nozzle is generated by dedicated magnetic\n\nc04.indd Sec1:327\n\n327\n\nFigure 4.4.39: Snecma PPS 1350 Hall effect thruster (Source:\nSnecma Moteurs).\n\n\u2014/\n\nIgnition Cathode . ) 4\nCondenser +\n\nFigure 4.4.40: Sketch and hardware of a pulsed plasma thruster\n(PPT) (Source: Aerojet).\n\nrings which create the applied MPD field.

A typical storage\npressure is 150 bar at 60 \u00b0C.\n\nThe block diagram of an electric propulsion system\nis visualized in Figure 4.4.41 for a RIT system. Besides\nthe high-pressure tank and the thruster itself, two ma-\njor subassemblies belong to the propulsion system.\n\nThe first is a mechanical or electromechanical\nflow control unit.

Therefore, engines are\nperiodically realigned by means of the mentioned\nmechanism, as in the case of the Artemis satellite\n(Figure 4.4.37).\n\nA critical aspect of electric propulsion systems is\nthe electromagnetic compatibility due to the high\nvoltages and the required high power demand of the\nengines. Nevertheless, standard shielding and filtering\nmethods are in general sufficient.\n\nDue to their high performance and efficiency,\nelectric propulsion systems are mostly applied for\nnorth-south station keeping of large communication\nsatellites. Astrium\u2019s RIT 10 and the UK T5 are on-\nboard Artemis. Boeing installs xenon ion propulsion\nsystems (XIPS) from the L-3 Corporation on its com-\nmunication satellites. The European satellite systems\nSpacebus 4000 of Thales-Alenia Space and Eurostar\n3000 of Astrium use the SPT 100 HET.\n\nIn preparation of the very ambitious European\nLISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) project,\nplanned to measure gravitational waves as predicted\nby Einstein, a precursor satellite named LISA-Pathfin-\nder will be equipped with an FEEP system.\n\n4.4.8 Components for Chemical\nPropulsion Systems\n\nBesides the most important propulsion components,\nthe propellant tanks and the thrusters, the remaining\n\n2/24/09 3:42:45 PM\n",

In an interplanetary probe such\nas Cassini, for example, it has to remain active up to\nthe completion of the multiyear mission. Therefore\nthe important pressure regulator is equipped with\ninternal redundancy.\n\nThe high-accuracy pressure transducers installed\nin the PCA are used during the mission to determine\nthe remaining propellant by means of the PVT me-\nthod. The accuracy of these sensors amounts to 0.02%\nof the maximum pressure compared to 0.3% of the\nstandard pressure transducers. The more accurate\nthe determination of the propellant mass, the longer\nthe satellite mission can be extended. The last few\nkilograms of propellant are used to raise the satellite\nfrom its valuable operating position in geostationary\norbit into a so-called \u201cgraveyard\u201d orbit.\n\nThe pyrotechnic valves exist, as described in\nSection 4.4.6.2, in a normally open (NO) and a nor-\nmally closed (NC) version (Figure 4.4.44).

Different ways of describing\nthe attitude, like the direction-cosine matrix, Euler\ndescription and quaternions, are presented. This is fol-\nlowed by a description of attitude dynamics, including\nan explanation of Euler differential equations, existing\ndisturbance torques and attitude prediction. Different\nattitude sensors and actuators are also presented. The\nsection concludes with practice-oriented methods of\nattitude control verification.\n\n4.5.1 Introduction and Overview\n\nThe attitude control system (ACS) determines and\ncontrols the orientation of a vehicle in space. The\nattitude (or the orientation) is always described with\nrespect to a reference system, either direction vectors\nwithin a reference coordinate system or as angles to\ndefined reference axes.\n\nThe attitude of a spacecraft is generally indepen-\ndent of its position. Therefore, attitude control has to\nbe clearly distinguished from orbit control.\n\nAs in every control aspect, attitude control con-\nsists of a closed control loop with:\n\ne Measurement and determination of the actual\nattitude\n\ne Comparison with the desired attitude\n\ne Driving of actuators through a dedicated control-\nler in order to achieve the desired attitude.\n\nWithin this control loop, the target could be either to\nachieve and keep a certain attitude, or to control the\nrate of an attitude change.\nThe execution of attitude control can occur in\nthree different modes:\n1. Under safety aspects as robust, coarse control\n(safe mode)\n2. With the target of best performance as fine control\n(science mode, precise mode)\n\n2/24/09 3:43:03 PM\n",

Asa transfer mode in order to damp and control\nthe spacecraft attitude rates or for attitude target\nacquisition.\n\n4.5.1.1 Impact on the Satellite Bus\n\nThe Attitude Control System (ACS) is an important\ndriver of system design. The mission goal (through\nthe payload) provides the boundary conditions\nfor the choice of appropriate attitude sensors and\nactuators. However, the basic functionalities of the\nsatellite have to be ensured, in order to:\n\ne Safeguard the performance of the power system\n(stable orientation of the solar arrays with respect\nto the Sun).\n\ne Safeguard the thermal conditions (orientation\ncontrol of the satellite body with respect to the\nSun and the Earth).\n\ne Adjust and maintain the attitude for maneuver\n(such as for orbit control).\n\nIn order to achieve a reliable ACS, the attitude requi-\nrements have to be considered in the satellite design\nprocess (e.g., with respect to mass distribution, potential\noscillations of the structure, etc.).\n\n4.5.1.2 Impact on the Payload\n\nThe functionality and performance of most payloads\nare closely linked to attitude determination and cont-\nrol: for example, for the orientation of a telescope for\nEarth observation, the orientation of the antennas of\na telecommunication satellite, or the orientation of\nscientific payload.\n\nFor these tasks the attitude accuracy and stability\nplay an important role and often the ability to carry\nout predefined slew maneuvers.\n\nIn many cases, telemetry data from the ACS is\npostprocessed together with the payload data in order\nto optimize the performance of the payload.\n\n4.5.1.3 Application Areas\n\nAn attitude and orbit control system is implemented\non nearly all space missions (whether human or\nunmanned). A distinction is made between \u201cpassive\u201d\nand active attitude control. \u201cPassive attitude control\u201d\nmeans the steering of the attitude without the use of\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:333\n\n333\n\nmechanical actuators, unlike active attitude control,\nwhere actuators are used within a control loop. The\nrequirements, placed on the type of attitude control,\ndepend on the mission characteristics.\n\nDuring the mission, the attitude of the satellite\nis determined on-board in real time, for the various\noperational modes (safe mode, science mode, etc.).\nBecause it is based on available on-board real-time\ndata, this attitude control is not as accurate as precise\nattitude determination, which is performed during\npostprocessing on the ground. Additional data is used\non the ground in order to minimize the sources of er-\nror which exist in the attitude determination process.\nThe scientific payload of the satellite (e.g., telescopes,\nradar sensors or optical cameras) generally requires\nprecise on-ground postprocessing of the attitude data\nin order to support the maximum resolution of the\ninstruments.\n\n4.5.2 Requirements for the Attitude\nControl System\n\nThe type and design of the ACS is mainly determined\nby the functional requirements (Table 4.5.1) of the\nsatellite bus and the payload.\n\nStability requirements are normally derived from\nthe payload and are indicated as the allowed angle\ndeviation within a fixed time interval.\n\nBesides these functional requirements, there are\nrequirements for the performance of the various\nprocesses, whereby the most important are:\n\ne Accuracy, distinguishing between real-time accu-\nracy and post facto attitude accuracy. The accuracy\nis represented as a plus or minus interval or, more\noften, as 6 values. (e.g., \u201c0.1\u00b0, 3 6\u201d means that in\n99.7% of all cases the residuals are below 0.1\u00b0).\n\ne Stability represents the accuracy of keeping at-\ntitude rates.\n\ne Agility describes the rate of time for changeovers\nbetween two dedicated attitudes.\n\nIn addition, the design of the ACS is driven by the\n\nfollowing general requirements and boundary\n\nconditions:\n\n\u00b0 Cost.\n\ne Design lifetime, for satellites typically from 5 to\n15 years.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:04 PM\n",

This section shows different attitude\n\nrepresentation methods and describes the paramete-\nrization of the spacecraft attitude.\n\n4.5.3.1 Reference Systems\n\nFor the mathematical representation of the attitude of\na body it is necessary to define two three-dimensional\nCartesian coordinate systems. These systems are\ndesignated as the reference system and the body\nsystem. While the reference system is independent\nof the attitude motion of the considered body, the\nbody-fixed coordinate system is anchored within the\nbody, following the motion of that body.\n\nThe mathematical meaning of the term attitude is\nthe angular deviation of these two coordinate systems.\nThe difference vector of the origins of these coordinate\nsystems (from the origin of the reference system to the\norigin of the body systems) is not relevant for attitude\nrepresentation. The focus is the rotation of the two\nsystems against each other. Figure 4.5.1 illustrates\nthis description. The reference system is represented\n\n2/24/09 3:43:04 PM\n",

These angles will\nbe defined in the following.\n\n4.5.3.2 Direction-Cosine Matrix\n\nAs defined in the previous section, the attitude of a\nspacecraft describes the orientation of a reference\nsystem with respect to a body system.

    "357": "CHO04.indd Sec1:336\n\n336\n\nWith three consecutive rotations every coordinate\nsystem can be transformed into any other. The ad-\nvantages of this attitude parameterization are that no\nsingularities exist and no trigonometric/arithmetic\noperations are needed. As shown in Equation 4.5.3,\nthere is a simple algorithm for rotation sequences.\nHowever, this representation is of less importance\nin the field of space operations. During a space miss-\nion, the attitude system engineer in the control center\nchecks the attitude data of the satellite on the telemetry\nscreen after reception at the ground station. For this\nprocess, an attitude matrix representation is inapprop-\nriate, because the angular deviations between the two\ncoordinate systems are not directly visible. In the field\nof satellite operations, it is common to use Euler angle\nrepresentations, as described in the next section.\n\n4.5.3.3 Euler Angles\n\nFor better visualization of the attitude, so-called Euler\nangles are used.\n\nThe three basic rotations around the respective\ncoordinate system axes (x, y, z) can be described using\nEuler angles, as follows.\n\nRotation around the x-axis with angle g@\n[1 0 0\n\nA,=|0 cose sing (4.5.4)\n[0 -sing cose\n\nRotation around the y-axis with angle @\n\n[cos@ 0 \u2014sin@\n\nA,=| 0 1 0 (4.5.5)\n\n| sin\u00ae 0 cos\u00e9\n\nRotation around the z-axis with angle y\n\n| cos vw snp 0\nA,=|-sin cos 0 (4.5.6)\n0 0 1\n\nA special convention of these angles, derived from the\nsteering angles in the field of aeronautics, is commonly\nused in the field of space engineering. The names of\nthese angles are indicated in Figure 4.5.2. Roll defines\nan angle deviation around the longitudinal direction\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\n(x-axis). The pitch angle describes the rotation around\nthe lateral axis (y-axis) and the yaw angle corresponds\nto a rotation around the vertical axis (z-axis). It is\nimportant to clearly define this angle assignment,\nin order to obtain an unambiguous description. In\nthe design phase of a mission this should also be\nnoted in the corresponding documentation to avoid\nmisinterpretation.\n\n4.5.3.4 Quaternions\n\nAnother method of attitude representation is to use\nquaternions. These hypercomplex numbers consti-\ntute an optimum with respect to memory load and\nnumerical stability:\n\nwhere:\n@y &\u00bb \u20ac, = components of the unit vector along the\nrotation axis,\n\n@= rotation angle around this axis.\n\nAnalogous to the attitude matrix, rotation sequences\ncan be easily expressed by\n\nM-3 = M2 @4n-3 (4.5.8)\n94(2-3) \u2014 I3(2-3) ~42(2-3) (2-3)\n$323) 942-3) (23) B(2-\nnox 3(2-3) 14(2-3) (2-3) 42(2-3) a (4.5.9)\n9(2-3) ~M(2-3) \u2014 a(2-3) 43(2-3)\n(2-3) ~4a(2-3)  ~43(2-3) 4(2-3)\nwhere:\n\n4-3 = complete rotation from state 1 to 3,\nq)-2 = rotation from state 1 to 2,\n4o-3 = rotation from state 2 to 3.\n\nThe disadvantage of quaternion parameterization is\na poor physical illustration. Quaternions are a purely\nmathematical representation and they are not used\nfor the visualization of attitude telemetry parame-\nters during satellite operations. Nevertheless, in the\non-board software and for attitude postprocessing,\nquaternions are commonly used.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:06 PM\n",

The relevant disturbance torques\nare described in the following sections.\n\n4.5.4.2 Disturbance Torques\n\nIn order to model the dynamic attitude of the space-\ncraft, the torques acting on the satellite have to be\nconsidered. A distinction is made between internal\nand external torques. Internal torques are usually\ngenerated by the actuators of the ACS (desired) and by\nmovable mechanisms (generally not desired, e.g., fuel\nsloshing, structure mechanisms, solar panels). External\ntorques are generated by the interaction of the space\nenvironment with the satellite. The corresponding\nmagnitude of the disturbance torques is mainly related\nto the orbit and attitude of the satellite and the physical\nproperties of the spacecraft. In the following only the\nmost important disturbance torques are considered.\n\nGravity Gradient Torque\nStarting from a satellite as an asymmetric rigid body\nwith finite dimensions, an external torque acts on the\nspacecraft due to the force resulting from the Earth\u2019s\ngravity.\n\nThe gravity gradient torque can be represented in\nthe body frame by the following relation:\n\nGM\nMya =3 > [ #5 X (Is 5) | (4.5.17)\n\"s\nwhere:\n\nGM = Earth\u2019s gravitational constant (see Section\n2.2.1.1),\n\nrs = position vector of the satellite.\n\nFrom this equation the following characteristics of the\n\ngravity gradient torque can be derived:\n\ne The torque is perpendicular to the local vertical.\n\ne The torque is inversely proportional to the cube of\nthe geocentric distance of the spacecraft.\n\ne The torque vanishes for spherically symmetric\nspacecraft with equal principle moments of\ninertia.\n\nSolar Radiation Torque\nThe photons of solar radiation impacting the surface\nof a satellite create a force that results in a torque\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\naround the center of mass of the spacecraft. The solar\n\nradiation pressure is virtually independent of the\n\norbital altitude of the satellite in an Earth orbit. The\n\nmain factors driving this torque are:\n\ne The intensity and spectral distribution of the\nincident radiation\n\ne The surface geometry and the optical characteris-\ntics of the spacecraft\n\ne The orientation of the Sun vector relative to the\nspacecraft.\n\nThe acting force corresponds to the impulse change\nof the incident light. For the simplified case of direct\nreflection it can be assessed by:\n\nFa =2(1+r) A (ean) (4.5.18)\nCc\n\nwhere:\n\nS = solar constant (1371 W/m\u2019),\n\nc= speed of light in vacuum,\n\nA= projection of the satellite surface in Sun direction,\nr= reflection coefficient,\n\nun = unit vector in Sun direction.\n\nBased on Equation 4.5.18 the resulting solar radiation\n\ntorque is\n\nMyo =(1% - 1%) X Bot (4.5.19)\n\nwhere:\n\nM,, = solar radiation torque,\n\nF,,, = force resulting from solar radiation pressure,\nr, = point of attack of force in center of area,\n\nrs = position vector of the satellite center of mass.\n\nAerodynamic Torque\n\nFor spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), the interac-\ntion of the satellite\u2019s surface with the residual atmo-\nsphere cannot be ignored. The aerodynamic torque\nis the dominant environmental torque for spacecraft\nbelow 400 km altitude.

During the\nsatellite design phase, this magnetic residual field is\nminimized by appropriate shielding and by taking it\ninto account when establishing the cabling layout of\nthe satellite. The attitude control algorithm needs the\nabsolute value of this residual moment also as input\nfor dimensioning the actuating variable and in order\nto ensure the stability of the control loop.

Internal disturbance\ntorques are, for example:\n\ne Leakage within the propulsion system\ne Fuel sloshing in the propulsion tanks\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:339\n\n339\n\ne Moving parts of the satellite structure\ne Crew movement on human space flight missions.\n\nThe modeling of these disturbance torques is very\ndifficult. Nevertheless, the maximum values of these\ninternal torques estimated during simulations should\nbe taken into account when designing the attitude\ncontrol loop in order to achieve stable and safe atti-\ntude control.\n\n4.5.5 Attitude Determination and\nControl\n\n4.5.5.1 Attitude Determination\n\nAttitude determination is the process of calculating\nthe actual satellite attitude (three-axis attitude)\nusing appropriate measurements (see the section on\nattitude sensors). The raw measurements generated by\nthe different sensors are combined after appropriate\nfiltering. Based on this data the attitude determination\nalgorithm is used to calculate the actual three-axis\nattitude of the spacecraft. Different attitude deter-\nmination methods are used and are described in the\nliterature. In this section algebraic attitude determi-\nnation is presented as an example.\n\nThe algebraic method is based on the direct-cosine\nmatrix representation of the attitude. Two vectors, u\nund \u00a5, define an orthogonal coordinate system with\nthe basis vectors q, rand s according to\n\nqqu\nuxv\n\n\u201cJux] (4.5.23)\n\ns=qxr\n\nassuming that u and vare not parallel.\n\nFor a given time, two vectors u, and y,, measured\nby attitude sensors, form the body-fixed coordinate\nframe as described above and therefore the spacecraft\nattitude matrix Aj:\n\nAy =[ 4 th is, | (4.5.24)\n\n2/24/09 3:43:09 PM\n",

The two vectors are\nneeded in the defined reference system in relation to\nwhich the attitude is described. (To repeat: attitude\nis the angular deviation of a reference frame against\na body-fixed frame.) These reference vectors, u, and\nv,, form the reference matrix A, with\n\nA,=[q, ins, | (4.5.25)\n\nAs defined in Section 4.5.3.2, the direct-cosine\nmatrix is determined by the following coordinate\ntransformation:\n\nAM,=M, (4.5.26)\n\nThis equation transforms the column vectors of M,\ninto the column vectors of M,. The equation can be\nsolved for the direct-cosine matrix A:\n\nA=M, M,\" (4.5.27)\nAs M, is orthogonal, it follows that\nA=M, M! (4.5.28)\n\nThe algebraic method with two vectors is also ref-\nerred to as deterministic attitude determination.\nThe disadvantage of this method is that the attitude\ndetermination is incorrect if one of the measured vec-\ntors is wrong. But several measurements are generally\navailable at the same time. By using the least squares\nestimation method, better and more stable attitude\n\nDesired\n\nAttitude\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nsolutions can be achieved. For this estimation method\na cost function is established and with the different\nmeasurements the minimum of this cost function is\ncalculated and an attitude solution is generated. More\ncomplex methods make use of a Kalman filter for the\nattitude determination algorithm. Within this filter\ninformation from previous observations (measure-\nments) as well as the dynamic characteristics are also\ntaken into account in order to obtain an optimal\nestimation of the attitude parameter. Kalman filters\nfor attitude applications can be found in the literature\nlisted in the Bibliography.\n\nFor attitude determination, consideration of the\nattitude prediction (or attitude propagation) process\nis also very important. Within this process the attitude\nstate is predicted for a future point in time by using\nthe kinematic and dynamic equations of motions. This\nattitude prediction is important for attitude control in\norder to adapt the control variables for the upcoming\ncontrol steps. Also within the ground satellite opera-\ntions, the satellite attitude is propagated to allow for\nthe generation of telecommands, for instance for orbit\nmaneuvers or for scientific operations.\n\n4.5.5.2 Attitude Control\n\nThe active modification and control of the satellite\u2019s\nattitude is understood as attitude control.\n\nFigure 4.5.4 shows a typical design of an attitude\ncontrol loop. The satellite should keep a desired\nattitude.

The desired attitude\nis compared to the measured actual attitude of the\nspacecraft. The delta of this process is the attitude\ndeviation. This deviation value is transferred to the\nattitude controller. Within this control algorithm\nthe commands for the actuators are generated and\ntransferred. The attitude actuators create a torque and\nactively change the attitude. In parallel the external\nand internal torques act on the satellite. The resulting\nattitude is measured by the sensors and the control\nloop is closed.\n\nDifferent approaches exist for the attitude control\nalgorithm. The most common approach is to use the\nso-called proportional, integral and derivative con-\ntroller (PID controller). The PID controller reacts to\na delta-signal \u20ac (attitude deviation) as follows:\n\nu(t)=Kp \u20ac(t)+ Kf e(t)de+ Kp de(t)/de (4.5.29)\n\nwhere:\n\nu(t) = controller output in the time domain,\n\u20ac(t) = delta signal (attitude deviation),\n\nKy, Kp Kp = PID controller parameters.\n\nIn the design phase of the spacecraft it is especially\nimportant to pay attention to the dimensioning and\nfunctionality of the ACS, because the success of a\nmission depends on the quality of the attitude control.\nFor this reason the ACS is modeled with software and\nup-to-date satellite characteristics information is used.\nSection 4.5.8 takes a closer look at the verification of\n\nthe ACS.\n\n4.5.6 Attitude Sensors\n\n4.5.6.1 General Aspects of Attitude Sensors\n\nAttitude sensors provide measurements of the actual\nattitude status.

If these consequences are\nknown, systematic errors can be compensated to a\nlarge extent.\n\nRandom errors result from unknown or unpredic-\ntable effects on the measurements (e.g., measurement\nnoise). Therefore they cannot be compensated, but\ncan be reduced by averaging (or filtering). However,\nthis is always a compromise between timeliness and\naccuracy.\n\nParameterization of Errors\n\nMeasurement errors are deviations from ideal sensor\n\nperformance. They can be classified by the following\n\nparameters (Figure 4.5.5):\n\ne Bias\n\ne Scale factor error\n\ne Nonlinearity\n\ne Asymmetry (different scale factors for the positive\nand negative regime)\n\ne Noise\n\ne Quantification error.\n\nRandom errors result in general from the sum of\ndifferent influences and are commonly described as\nthe standard deviation (with the parameter o).\n\nTime Response\n\nAnother error source results from the time correlation\nof the measurement and plays a significant role for\ndynamic processes. Important variables are:\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\ne Dead Time: Measurement value and time of\nmeasurement are shifted in time; this is in general\nan effect of digital signal processing.\n\ne Delay Time: The measurement value is continuous-\nly determined during a certain time interval, during\nwhich this value is changing. Within this process\nchanges are displayed with a delay and periodic cha-\nracteristics are shown with smaller amplitude. The\ndelay time is usually referred to as the \u201cbandwidth\u201d\nof the measurement. The bandwidth complies with\nthe frequency at which half of the effective value\n(around 70% of the amplitude) is displayed.\n\n4.5.6.2 Star Sensors\n\nStar sensors, or star trackers, determine the inertial\nattitude through identification of star patterns. They\nconsist of a camera (usually a separate sensor head)\nand a connected electronic part for image processing\nand attitude determination.\n\nIn order to determine the three-axis attitude, the\nidentification of two stars is sufficient, whereas for initial\nattitude acquisition a pattern consisting of four stars is\npreferred to achieve unambiguous results. By compari-\nson of the star pattern within the on-board star catalog,\nthe attitude of the star sensor can be calculated.\n\nAccuracy\n\nThe achievable accuracy is determined by:\n\ne Focal length of the objective (typically 30-50 mm)\n\ne Pixel resolution of the detector (typically 0.02\u00b0)\n\ne Signal strength of the visible stars (visual ma-\ngnitude mv 5 to mv 6.5, achievable with large\napertures) and the noise of the detector\n\ne The focusing and the interpolation method\n\ne Number of processed stars (typically 3-15).\n\nThe geometry of the observation gives the result of\na five to ten times higher accuracy around the axes\nperpendicular to the optical axis than around the\noptical axis. The accuracy of good star sensors is in\nthe region of a few arc seconds.\n\nTechnical Design\n\nIn front of the objective there is a so-called baffle, a\nlight trap which blocks the lateral incident stray light\nfrom the Earth and Sun (Figure 4.5.6). With baffle\n\n2/25/09 12:30:45 PM\n",

Even more important is the albedo exclusion\nangle, representing the tolerance angle for reflective\nlight from the Earth. For the above-mentioned baffle\nlength, this angle is about 25\u00b0. This enables star sensors\nto operate in LEO within the antinadir hemisphere.\nWithout a baffle, the weak starlight would, over wide\nangle ranges, be overlaid by stray light.\n\nThe objective projects the star light onto a CCD\nchip (Figure 4.5.7). The focal length is adjusted so that\nthe light of a star is spread over several pixels. This\nmakes it possible to determine the center point of the\nlight distribution, which means the true position of\nthe star on the chip, with subpixel accuracy.\n\nCCD chips are on the one hand very light sensitive;\non the other hand, they suffer from hard radiation,\nespecially from the proton radiation of the Sun. This\nradiation can permanently damage the crystalline\nstructures of the chip, increasing the noise floor on\nthe CCD. This effect appears less at lower tempera-\ntures, therefore Peltier elements are frequently used\nfor cooling.\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:343\n\n343\n\nObjective\n\nca. 250 mm\n\nCCD chip\n\nPeltier\ncooler\n\nFigure 4.5.7: Cross-section of a star sensor head (Source: Jena-\nOptronik).\n\nActive pixel sensors (APSs) are more radiation\nresistant than CCD sensors, and also have a signal\nprocessing advantage by allowing to directly read out\nat dedicated positions.\n\nApplication Areas\n\nStar sensors are the dominating technology for satellite\nattitude determination because of their accuracy and\nthe three-axis attitude information. Installation of se-\nveral sensors (or sensor heads), operating in different\nview directions, allows minimization of glare effects\nfrom the Earth, Sun and Moon. In addition, the accu-\nracy of attitude determination can be further enhanced\nby careful selection and combination of the appropriate\nsensors and their respective axes (Table 4.5.3).\n\n4.5.6.3 Sun Sensors\n\nSun sensors measure the direction to the Sun and\ntherefore provide two-axis attitude information.

The sum of\nthese errors forms the so-called \u201crandom walk,\u201d\nwhose uncertainty increases in proportion to the\nsquare root of the number of measurements (or\nwith time).\n\nConstant or slowly varying error contributions are\noften determined by continuous reference measure-\nments with drift-free attitude sensors on-board the\nsatellite, and can therefore be mostly compensated\nduring signal processing.\n\nGyro Designs\n\nThe following gyro designs are used in spacecraft:\ne Mechanical gyros (very common, decreasing)\ne Hemispheric resonator gyros (rare, increasing)\ne Ring laser gyros (very common, increasing)\n\ne Fiber optic gyros (rare, increasing).\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nMechanical Gyros\n\nThe rate measurement of a mechanical gyro is based\non the gyroscopic effect: an axisymmetric rigid body\nis put into rotation and therefore has an angular\nmomentum. The angular momentum is an inertial\nvalue, only influenced by torques:\n\nM=H, (4.5.30)\n\nwhere:\nM = torque acting on the rotating mass,\n\nH, = angular momentum of the rotating mass.\n\nAs long as there are no torques acting, the angu-\nlar momentum is constant with respect to size and\namount. The angular momentum vector forms an\ninertial reference. With a corresponding torque-free\ngimbal mounting of the rotating mass, the attitude\nangles with respect to the angular momentum axis\ncan be directly measured.\n\nFrom a technical perspective it is less complex to\nalign the angular momentum vector with the rotation\nand to measure the resulting torque.\n\nFor single axis measurement, the gyro consists\nof a rotor, elastically suspended in a frame. The\nframe can be tilted (see Figure 4.5.17). If the gyro\nis rotated around its measurement axis, precession\ntorque is generated, which results in a declination of\nthe angular momentum axis. This declination angle\nis proportional to the angular velocity.\n\nThe measurement accuracy can be increased by\nkeeping this declination (deviation) continuously at\n\nGyro measurement axis\n\na\nRotation impulse dt, Actuator\nvector\n\nRegulator\n\nDamper\nDeclination measurement\n\nFigure 4.5.17: Principle of rotation rate measurement for a me-\nchanical gyro (Source: Lawrence).\n\n2/24/09 3:43:20 PM\n",

This is shown in the following,\nusing GPS as an example.\n\nAttitude determination with GPS is based on an\nevaluation of GPS signals received simultaneously\nat different positions. The distance between two\nreceiving antennas is called the baseline. The carrier\nphase of the GPS signal is received at the antennas\nwith slightly different reception times. The resulting\nphase difference can be measured; it is the cosine\nof the angle between the antenna baseline and the\ndirection of the GPS satellite transmitting the signal\n(Figure 4.5.22).\n\nBy combining phase difference measurements\nwith different GPS satellites, the direction of the base-\nline in space can be completely determined \u2014 and thus,\nusing two linear independent baselines, the three-axis\nattitude of the satellite. For this process at least three\nantennas are needed, which are positioned as shown\nin Figure 4.5.23.\n\nComparison of the carrier phase differences assumes\na simultaneously available and authentic signal at all\nreceiving GPS antennas of the satellite.

The following formula applies to the simplified\n\none-axis case:\n\ngot (4.5.31)\nI\nwhere:\nT = torque,\nI= moment of inertia (constant for a rigid body).\n\nThe attitude, represented by the angle g, results after\ntwo integrations. Thus a device that generates a tor-\nque in a defined way can be used as an actuator for\nattitude control.\n\nExternal and Internal Torques\nExternal torques result in interaction with the space-\ncraft environment. The usable torque has an effect on\nthe satellite attitude; its corresponding reaction torque\nremains outside the spacecraft system and needs no\nfurther consideration. External torques can be genera-\nted, for example, by thrusters or magnet torquers.\nAn internal torque affects the satellite attitude in\nthe same way, but its corresponding reaction torque\nremains within the spacecraft system and has to be\n\n4\n\n2/24/09 3:43:24 PM\n",
    "373": "CHO4.indd Sec1:352\n\n352\n\nconsidered further. For example, a reaction wheel\naccelerates its flywheel and thus generates a torque in\nthe spacecraft. The angular momentum of the flywheel\nrotation speed change is taken over conversely by the\nrotation of the spacecraft structure; the overall angular\nmomentum of the spacecraft system remains constant.\nThus internal torques can only internally distribute\nparts of the spacecraft\u2019s angular momentum, within\nthe capacities of its actuator elements.\n\nSince external disturbance torques can be com-\npensated by internal torques only for a limited\nduration, \u201cmomentum management\u201d with external\ntorques has to be regularly undertaken. In LEO exter-\nnal disturbance torques always exist for satellites with\nconstant attitude. Continuous attitude control without\ninvolving any external actuator torque is therefore not\n\npossible.\n\nRequired Properties of Actuators\n\nFor a three-axis attitude control process the accuracy\nrequirements for actuators are not as stringent as for\nattitude sensors. Small-scale errors result in slightly\nchanged loop characteristics and can be generally\nafforded. Small errors in alignment or biases of actu-\nators are compensated inherently by the three-axis\ncontrol process, but have to be considered specifically\nfor control about only one rotation axis.\n\nMore important are nonlinear properties, such as\nquantization, jumps or switching. As noncompensa-\ntable disturbances they affect and limit the achievable\nstability of control (Table 4.5.9).\n\nTable 4.5.9: Characteristics of actuators for attitude control.\n\nActuator Torques Remarks\nThrusters Small to very high External torque,\ntorques, quantized _ needs fuel\nMagnet torquer Several mNm, only _ External torque,\nin two axes cost effective\nReaction wheels = 200mNm, Internal torque\nvariable\nMomentum = 50mNm, Internal torque,\nwheels variable, momentum\nmomentum bias stabilization\nControl Temporarily very Internal torque,\nmomentum gyros high torques expensive\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFurthermore, possible side effects of actuators on\nthe satellite system, such as magnetic fields or vibra-\ntion, have to be considered.\n\nFurther Actuator Elements\n\nThe following elements can be regarded in the broader\nsense as attitude actuators. They either provide control\ntorques passively, or under specific conditions trans-\nform disturbance torques into control torques.\n\nNutation Damper\n\nNutation dampers are used as passive actuators for\nspin-stabilized satellites. Such a damper can be desi-\ngned simply, for example as a movable spherical mass\nin a closed tube filled with a fluid. Nutation causes\nmovement of the mass. The damping fluid takes up\na part of the surplus rotation energy and therefore\nreduces nutation.\n\nGravity Gradient Boom\n\nA boom separates a tip mass from the satellite\u2019s center\nof gravity. A body with such a long-shaped boom is\nsubject to the (Earth\u2019s) gravity gradient and creates a\ntorque which causes the spacecraft\u2019s longitudinal axis\nto align radially to the Earth\u2019s center.\n\nGravity gradient stabilization is a simple method\nto achieve coarse nadir pointing for small satellites in\nLEO. Nevertheless, this stabilization should be sup-\nported by controlled damping with magnet torquers.\n\nMechanisms, Sun Sailing\n\nSunlight causes a slight pressure on the irradiated\nsurfaces of a spacecraft (e.g., the solar panels). The\nresulting forces and corresponding torques can be\nvaried with a slightly altered steering of the solar\npanels and can therefore be regarded as small control\ntorques. This kind of Sun sailing is used by geostation-\nary satellites for momentum management.\n\n4.5.7.2 Reaction Wheels, Momentum Wheels,\nControl Momentum Gyros\n\nReaction wheels provide a reaction torque which res-\nults from rotational acceleration (or deceleration) of a\nflywheel. The flywheel rotation is driven by an electric\nmotor, which allows a variable adjustment of torque.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:25 PM\n",
    "374": "4.5 Attitude Control\n\nThe torque practically usable for attitude control is\nopposite to the flywheel\u2019s angular momentum change\nand follows the equation\n\nM=-Hy =\u2014Ig - @ (4.5.32)\n\nwhere:\n\nHg = angular momentum vector of the flywheel,\n\nIz= moment of inertia (about the flywheel rotation\naxis),\n\n@ x = angular velocity vector of the flywheel.\n\nThree cases can be distinguished:\n\n1. The rotation speed of the flywheel is low. Accel-\neration or deceleration causes a reaction torque\naligned with the flywheel axis. Wheels designed\nfor this operational mode are called reaction\nwheels.\n\n2. The rotation speed of the flywheel is high, and so\nis, accordingly, its angular momentum. A torque\ntransverse to the rotation axis causes a slow pre-\ncession (movement) of the wheel, which compen-\nsates the transverse torque. This gyroscopic effect\nachieves stabilization for the transverse axes of the\nwheel. Wheels which are designed for this purpose\nare called momentum wheels.\n\n3. Amomentum wheel can be suspended in a gimbal\nthat can force tilting of the spin axis. The tilting\ncauses (conversely to gyroscopic stabilization)\nvery high reaction torques. A gimbaled wheel built\nfor this purpose is called a control momentum\ngyro (CMG).\n\nDisturbances\n\nIn reaction and momentum wheels the flywheel mass\n\nis commonly supported by robust ball bearings which\n\ncan sustain the launch loads but have the following\nside effects as well:\n\n1. Microvibration, caused by the rolling of the balls\nand by the movement of the bearing cage.\n\n2. Vibrations caused by static and dynamic imbal-\nances of the flywheel (typically <lgcm, or\n<10gcm\u2019). Amplitude and frequency of these\nvibrations increase with rotation speed.\n\n3. Reversal of friction torque at wheel speed zero\ncrossing (typically +10mNm) and variation of\nfriction (e.g. 1 mNm) at steady-state speed.\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:353\n\n353\n\nReaction Wheels and Momentum Wheels\n\nThe concepts of reaction and momentum wheels\nare in principle the same; the differences are in the\ndimensioning of the motor and flywheel. Reaction\nwheel motors are designed for high torque that is\nprovided at low rotation speeds. The flywheel, running\nat different speed levels, is commonly manufactured\nas an integral part with low variation of imbalances\nover its full speed range. Momentum wheels, running\nconstantly at high speed, are equipped with a spoke\nwheel that is more mass effective and provides better\nstructural damping.\n\nThe housing (of both types) is generally evac-\nuated to a low pressure level which avoids on the\none hand the vaporizing of the lubricant in the be-\narings, and on the other hand limits the atmospheric\nfriction.\n\nThe electronics needed to drive the motor are\nusually placed inside the housing, but may also be\nseparated for better heat dissipation (Figure 4.5.24).\n\nOff-the-shelf reaction and momentum wheels are\navailable for angular momentum capacities from 0.1\nto 250Nms.\n\nControl Momentum Gyro\n\nA control momentum gyro (CMG) is a gimbal-\nmounted momentum wheel (Figure 4.5.25). A\ndistinction is made between single-gimbal CMGs,\nwhich can be rotated around a single transverse axis,\nand dual- gimbal CMGs, which can be turned around\ntwo transverse axes like a Cardan joint.\n\nTurning transverse to the angular momentum\nresults in torques which may be 100 times higher than\nthe usual reaction torques of a reaction wheel. This\nallows substantial improvement in satellite pointing\nagility.\n\nThe generated torques change their direction with\nthe orientation of the flywheel. That is why the high\ntorque is only available within certain boundaries and\nwhy singularities occur even if CMGs are working\ntogether in a cluster arrangement.\n\nFor complete three-axis attitude control at least\nthree single-gimbal GMGs are needed.\n\nCompared to reaction wheels, CMG technology\nrequires much more volume and mass. Therefore,\nCMGs are preferably used in large satellites.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:25 PM\n",

They are applied also for large\ntorques, as needed for attitude control during orbit\ncontrol maneuvers.\n\nThe usable torque results from a combination of\nthrust force and lever arm. Torque levels from 0.1 to\n10Nm or more can be easily achieved. However, the\nfollowing aspects have to be regarded.\n\nFuel\n\nThrusters need fuel, which may be supplied from an exis-\nting on-board orbit control propulsion system. Since\nattitude control thrusters are small, their temporary use\nfor momentum management or wheel unloading does\nnot consumea significant amount of fuel. On the other\nhand, continuous and precise attitude control over\nyears, using thrusters alone, would not be reasonable.\n\nCold Gas as Fuel\n\nFor scientific missions, users frequently require the a\npriori exclusion of contamination of instruments or\ndisturbance of the magnetic field. These are usually\nshort- or mid-term missions for which post facto atti-\ntude information is relevant. For such cases, attitude\nregulation using cold gas is an option (Figure 4.5.27).\n\nImpulse Bit\n\nSwitching thrusters on or off requires a certain duration\nthat results in a minimum thrust effect, the so-called\nimpulse bit. The size of this impulse bit may limit the\nstability of attitude control achievable with thrusters.\n\nCH04.indd Sec1:355\n\nFigure 4.5.27: Cold gas thruster (with piezovalve) of 40 mm\ndiameter (Source: RTG Aero-Hydraulic Inc.).\n\nAccuracy of Attitude Control\n\nContinuous operation at high control accuracy\n(without leaving a \u201cdead band\u201d around the target)\nwould require permanent alternation between \u201cne-\ngative\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d thruster activation. Besides\nincessant fuel consumption, the high \u201cpulse rate\u201d\ncould excite oscillations in large satellite structures,\nsuch as solar panels or antennas.\n\nNumber of Thrusters\n\nThrusters cause primary forces. In order to avoid any\nside effects from attitude control in the spacecraft\u2019s\norbit, attitude control thrusters should be operated in\npairs, separated by a lever arm and firing in opposite\ndirections.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:28 PM\n",

Thus, testing attitude thrusters under laboratory\nconditions is not practical.\n\n4.5.7.4 Magnetic Torquer\n\nA magnetic torquer (also referred to as a \u201ctorque rod\u201d)\ngenerates a strong magnetic dipole that interacts with\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Thus the torquer is subject\nto an external torque, like a compass needle.\n\nThe dipole can be generated by a simple coil (of\ncopper or aluminum); its strength is proportional to\nthe area which is enclosed by the electric current and\nto the current itself. Mass-effective designs can be\nmade in this simple way up to dipoles of 10 Am\u2019. To\ngenerate stronger dipoles, the coil is wrapped around a\ncore material, typically a rod of soft iron that amplifies\nthe magnetic flux inside the coil. These \u201ctorque rods\u201d\n(Figure 4.5.28) are designed for typically 50 to 250 Am\u201d\ndipole moments.\n\nUsable Control Torque\n\nThe torque which can be used for the attitude cont-\nrol process is proportional to the dipole moment of\nthe torquer and the strength of the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield and depends on the angle between these two.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nNwindings\nCopper lines\nCore material\n\nFigure 4.5.28: Design of a torque rod (Source: ZARM, Bremen).\n\nIt can be formulated in a straightforward way as a\ncross-product:\n\nT,=DxB (4.5.33)\n\nwhere:\n\nT,= established torque vector [N m],\n\nD= dipole moment vector [A m\u2019],\n\nB= Earth\u2019s magnetic field strength vector [T].\n\nExample: A torque rod with a dipole of 50 A m\u2019 at the\nequator (B= 20 uT to the north) that points east gene-\nrates a torque of 1000 \u00abN m, pointing to the zenith.\n\nApplications\nMagnetic torquers generate quite weak external tor-\nques only in a plane perpendicular to the Earth\u2019s ma-\ngnetic field vector. In polar orbits, where the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field changes its orientation continually, all\ntorque directions can be generated within a reasonable\nperiod of time with a set of magnetic torquers poin-\nting in different directions. Thus torquers are suitable\nfor continuous angular momentum management or\nfor wheel unloading in highly inclined LEOs.\nBecause of their simplicity, magnetic torquers\n(Figure 4.5.29) are cost efficient and reliable. In\ncontrast to thrusters, only electric current is needed\nfor operation (Table 4.5.12).\n\n2/24/09 3:43:30 PM\n",

Moreover,\nthe ACS is constructed with backups to minimize the\nprobability of single point failures.\n\nAll these elements, functions and the system itself\nhave to be verified within the qualification process\n(which verifies the suitability of a new design) or within\nthe acceptance process, (which demonstrates that the\nimplementation of the design and the manufacture\nhave been carried out properly).\n\nIn Europe the formal verification steps themselves\nand the standards to carry out each of these steps\nhave been defined by the European Cooperation on\nSpace Standardization (ECSS), which was established\nby ESA.\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:357\n\nIt is common for the main functions of the satellite,\nparticularly the processes of the ACS, to be regularly\nchecked by a software module which detects critical\nstates and automatically switches over to alternative\nmodes or to redundant hardware. The module goes\nby the name of fault detection, isolation and recovery\n(FDIR). Its autonomous functions may essentially affect\nthe attitude control and have to be verified carefully at\nthe system level as well.\n\nFurthermore, the ACS elements may interfere\nmagnetically or electrically with other satellite sub-\nsystems or even with each other (e.g., torque rod\nactivation may disturb magnetometer measure-\nments). These aspects are summarized by the terms\nEMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) or EMI\n(Electromagnetic Interference).\n\nMethods for testing and verification can also be\nseen as instruments for further development; they\nshould therefore begin as early as possible.

The equations should be linear and\nkept as simple as possible. The closed chain of these\ntransfer functions represents the attitude control loop,\ncommonly as a linear differential equation. For this\n\nCH04.indd Sect:358 \u00a9\n\ntype of equation a solution always exists and can be\nfound elegantly by applying Laplace transforms.\n\nThe advantage of such an analytical solution is its\nclosed form, which allows immediate assessment of\nthe stability of the control loop and easy optimization\nof the controller parameter.\n\nOn the other hand, state-of-the-art controllers\nare based on computer programs working with\ncomplex and nonlinear processes. Simplification\nand linearization of these processes are in most cases\nnot possible without inadmissible distortion of the\nmathematical models.\n\n4.5.8.2 Software Simulation\n\nVerification of the attitude control processes can also\nbe performed purely by software simulation. In this\ncase the different elements of the attitude control loop\n(sensors, actuators, environment, etc.) are represen-\nted by software modules. These modules copy (as\nauthentically as possible) the element characteristics\nand can even reflect nonlinear and complex processes\nsuch as conditioned mode transitions, switching and\n\n2/24/09 3:43:32 PM\n",

In particular the software for attitude\ndetermination and attitude control can be embedded\nas identical modules.\n\nThe complete attitude control loop is represented\nby linking its several element modules to form a closed\nchain.\n\nThe simulation itself is done numerically and\nprovides a particular solution for a specific case. The\ngeneral behavior of the attitude control loop can be\nestablished by running a series of simulations with\ndifferent settings for module parameters and initial\nconditions. Parameter variation can be done systema-\ntically or randomly by Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nSimulation is a commonly used method to verify\nexisting concepts or developments (Figure 4.5.30).\n\nEnvironmental Models\nPlant Model\n\nActuator\nInterface\nModels\n\nDisturbance Torques\n\nActuator\n\nModels\nActuator Torques\n\nACS Software Simulator on PC\n\nController\nSoftware\n\n359\n\nSimulation tools such as MATLAB/Simulink allow\nin turn the design of control loops and automati-\ncally generate the executable software code from\nsymbolic modules which can be directly embedded\nin the on-board computer software.

HILT runs in real time and is\ntherefore practical for verification of the implemented\nattitude control subsystem.\n\nAn important aspect for verification is the separate\ndevelopment of on-board data handling (OBDH)\ncontrol software and the \u201cverification simulator\u201d. Such\na verification simulator can be suitably developed by\nanother company ora separated in-house department.\nStrict separation of both developments reduces the\nrisk of double errors (e.g., in axis polarity, scaling,\netc.) which are critical but compensate each other\nin the test setup and thus would not become visible\nduring verification.\n\n4.5.8.4 Air Bearing Test Bed\n\nEven more realistic than HILT is end-to-end verifi-\ncation of the completely integrated ACS on an air\nbearing test bed. But this is subject to restrictions:\n\n1. For sensors such as star trackers or Earth sensors,\nthe environmental conditions of space and their\ndependence on the current attitude cannot be\nduplicated; for magnetometer or Sun sensors they\ncan only be approached. Attitude propagation\nusing gyros is possible without restriction. Thus\nthe closed attitude control loop can only partially\nbe tested with original sensors.\n\n2. Disturbance torques, present in space, are in the\nrange of a few millinewton meters (for small satel-\nlites, 100 U Nm). Test beds are subject to higher\ndisturbances, even if they are ideally suspended.\nHence an attitude control using weak actuators\ncan be verified only qualitatively. Furthermore,\nthe center of gravity of the elastic test bed table\nmoves slightly under the influence of gravity,\nwhich limits the angular corridor for authentic\ntesting. Geometry also restricts it.\n\n3. Spacecraft rotation axes go through the center of\ngravity, which is normally located inside the ori-\nginal satellite shape. Air bearing tests are therefore\ncarried out with a special satellite engineering\nmodel containing a representative arrangement of\nattitude control elements. Air bearing verification\nwith the completed original satellite flight model\nis usually not possible.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nFigure 4.5.32: Air bearing test bed at TU Berlin, 1994 (Source:\nTU Berlin).\n\nIn certain cases, such as for the qualification of\nnew attitude control methods or HILT of control\nmomentum gyros, the above-mentioned restrictions\nplay a minor role.\n\nExample 1\n\nThe test setup is put on a sphere (in the center of\nFigure 4.5.32), which is supported in a shell by a con-\ntinuous flow of pressurized air. Thus, the whole table\ncan rotate freely. The satellite engineering model (on\nthe table) works independently; it is equipped with\nits ACS, batteries and a telemetry and telecommand\nunit. The total rotating mass is about 20kg.\n\nThe massive frame in the lower part defines the\ncenter of gravity in the center of the sphere. The\nrigidity of this setup and its geometry allow limited\nslewing around the horizontal axes and unlimited\nrotation around the vertical axis.\n\nExample 2\n\nIn this test setup the model of a complete (micro)satellite\nis integrated into a spherical shell of about 30 cm\ndiameter. This small satellite model contains all the\nsubsystems needed for independent operation and\nfor demonstrating the attitude control processes (i.e.,\nattitude control elements including small cold gas\nthrusters, the electrical power subsystem, telemetry\nand telecommand, on-board computer).\n\n2/24/09 3:43:35 PM\n",

In this sense a spacecraft is nothing more than\na data processing machine. Data is registered by the\nsensors, processed by the on-board computers, stored,\nand then transmitted by telemetry to the ground.\nHence, data management is the central element of a\nspacecraft. The data management segment controls all\nother devices and collects the provided data. Informa-\ntion is extracted from this data and then transmitted\nto the ground.\n\nIn principle there are two different data mana-\ngement segments on-board with two different func-\ntions (see Figure 4.6.1). The first segment\u2019s task is\ncontrol and surveillance, traditionally executed by\nthe on-board computer, which controls the spacecraft\nso that it survives and fulfills its mission. The second\nsegment\u2019s task is payload monitoring and control. This\nfunction is traditionally executed by the payload com-\nputer, which collects the payload data and information;\nthat is, it supports the scientific mission of the space-\ncraft. We say \u201ctraditionally\u201d because at the moment\n\nPayload\n\nTraditional Payload Computer\n\nSteering\nTraditional on-Board Computer\n\nos =\n\n. sical System of the Spat\n\nFigure 4.6.1: Traditional approach to the structuring of data\nmanagement in the space segment.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:36 PM\n",
    "383": "CHO04.indd Sec1:362\n\n362\n\nthere are two trends: an attempt to execute everything\nona powerful, dependable central computer, versus an\nattempt to distribute all functions over many smaller\ncomputers.\n\n4.6.1.1 Differences to \u201cNormal\u201d Earth (Ground)\nDevices\n\nThe data management system on-board is similar to\nmany other embedded systems on the ground; but in\nspace we have very strict constraints and difficulties,\nas follows\n\nSpecial Requirements for Space Applications\n\ne Reliability: This property is extremely important\nfor the data management system and is the main\ncause for its high expense in comparison to ter-\nrestrially embedded systems (see Section 4.6.4.).\nThree factors determine reliability: robustness, self-\nhealing (self-regeneration) and fault tolerance.\n\ne Self-healing (self-regeneration): The spacecraft\nmust be able to handle and treat failures and\nanomalies by reconfiguration using redundant\nresources (reserves and spares). This is especial-\nly important for missions with long lifetimes,\nfor example 15 years. In these cases, simple self-\nhealing using cheap components is not enough.\nHere we rather need very robust components.\nThis originates a trade-off: how much to invest\nin robustness to avoid failures, and how much to\ninvest in redundancy to compensate for failures?\n\ne Fault Tolerance: Even if components are not\npermanently damaged, malfunctions are to be\nexpected at any time. The system must be able to\nrecognize such anomalies, to compensate and to\ncorrect them, favorably, before they have unex-\npected consequences. On Earth we find similar\nrequirements (and even stricter ones) in the case\nof safety-critical systems, such as for railway\nand aircraft transportation systems or for nuclear\nreactor control. Nevertheless, on the ground we\nare well protected by an approximately 50km\nthick atmospheric layer against cosmic radiation;\na spacecraft is, however, not protected. This radi-\nation causes a huge amount of data corruption\n(bit flips) and leads to much faster aging of the\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nelectronic components. Exactly as with terrestrial\nsafety-critical systems, data corruption must be\ntreated. However, its frequency is higher in space\nby approximately a factor of 10 up to 1000; 1 to\n10 bit flips per day can be expected to occur in the\non-board computer memory (e.g. 16 Mbytes).\nVery Limited Space, Energy (Power) and Dim-\nension Resources: As with hand-held devices\n(cellular phones, portable navigation systems,\nMP3 players, organizers, cameras) the system has\nto use those resources very economically. Solutions\nfor such Earth products can be of interest also for\nspace missions if they are able to survive space\nconditions.\n\nCold/Heat: Although the spacecraft is exposed to\nextreme temperatures, from \u2014170 to +120\u00b0C, the\ntemperature range of the data management seg-\nment is relatively harmless. The data management\nsegment is rather well protected in the middle\nof the spacecraft. The temperature mostly stays\nbetween +10 and +40\u00b0C, which produces no dif-\nficulties for the electronics. With some terrestrial\napplications the requirements are more extreme:\nfor instance, automotive electronics must be able\nto work from \u201440 (winter nights) to +80\u00b0 C (direct\nSun in summer).\n\nVacuum: For electronics on the ground, we can use\nair (even ventilators) to conduct heat away from\nthe heat source. In space, in vacuum, it is not so\nsimple to conduct heat away. This can lead to a heat\nconcentration and a very irregular temperature\ndistribution in the electronic components. Metal\nheat conductors must be used to transport heat\nfrom the electronic boards to the main spacecraft\nstructure.\n\nNo Gravity: This should be no problem for the\nelectronics and the software, but a loose, small\nmetal part (e.g., a cut-off piece of wire) could freely\nmove around and cause short circuits at different\nplaces. We have similar problems in terrestrial\napplications experiencing strong vibrations, for\nexample in moving vehicles.\n\nVibrations: In free flight in orbit vibrations are\nhardly to be expected, but during the launch, for\nabout 10 to 15 minutes there are extreme vibra-\ntions on the rocket (launcher) up to seven times the\n\n2/24/09 3:43:38 PM\n",
    "384": "4.6 Data Management\n\nEarth\u2019s gravitational acceleration (g). At separation\nthere is a shockwave of a few microseconds at up to\n1000g. This requires especially robust hardware.\nSoftware Complexity: As in all other information\ntechnology areas, software complexity increases\nrapidly. It has now reached dimensions which are\nbarely controllable. With today's complexity one\nmust use proven software engineering methodo-\nlogy and a strict quality assurance program. The\nexpenses for software quality assurance are often\nunderestimated; they amount to between 50 and\n80% of the complete software development cost.\nSoftware Uploads: Software efforts are almost\nalways underestimated. Hence, some missions\nstart before the software is ready. This is not a good\nconcept and carries many dangers in itself. Never-\ntheless, it is important to create the capability of\nreloading new software or software updates. This\nfunctionality is also usually provided for mobile\nconsumer electronics and navigation systems.\nSoftware uploads are necessary because it is not\npossible to foresee all possible situations on-board\nthe spacecraft. During the mission improvements\nare necessary or errors might be recognized and\nnew software must be installed on-board the\nspacecraft. Another reason is that in the course of\nthe mission components could be permanently\ndamaged or change their working properties. It\nis conceivable to have software which foresees\nall these situations, but the complexity of such\na system would be too high. Therefore it is usual\nto wait until a failure or unexpected situation is\ndiscovered before updating the software.\nRemote Diagnosis: It is not always the case that\nthe software can recognize and identify all possible\nanomalies. Hence, a remote diagnosis capability is\nrequired so that the developers can diagnose the\nsystem from the ground. The software must be\nable to collect state information on all subsystems\nand transmit it to the ground. This functionality is\nalso used for large terrestrial machines (newspaper\nprinters, excavators, mining machinery, packing\nmachines, etc.). These machines are distributed\nworldwide, but maintenance engineers cannot be\neverywhere \u2014 they have to diagnose errors from\nremote offices.\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:363\n\n363\n\ne High Computing Performance: Usually the\ncomputing performance in spacecraft is slower\nthan comparable devices on the ground by a factor\nof 10 to 100. The demanded high reliability and\nlimited resources exclude high computing per-\nformance. Today, space applications are always in\nneed of more computing power. New ways must be\nfound to combine high computing performance\nwith high reliability and limited resources (and\nnot just for space applications).\n\nThese requirements are not new and they are also\nnot so different from the ones valid for terrestrial\napplications. However, the problem with data proces-\nsing systems in spacecraft is that all these requirements\nmust be fulfilled at the same time.\n\n4.6.1.2 Development Trends\n\nInformation technology (data management) is the\nfastest changing discipline for space missions. Hence,\nit is important to look not only at today\u2019s state of the\nart, but also to analyze the trends for future missions.\n\nTrend 1: More Autonomy, More Data Reduction\n\nIn the simplest case it suffices if the data management\ncollects, saves and later transmits the data to the Earth.\nHowever, in many cases we do not need the raw data,\nbut only the information contained in it. For example,\na satellite which should find a fire on the ground can\ntake an optical image with 10 megapixels (30 Mbytes).\nHowever, we are only interested in knowing where the\nfire is located. This could be coded, say, in 1 kbyte. This\nis a data reduction of 30000 to 1. Today all satellites\ntransmit daily more than 10'* bytes to the ground.\nThis is a huge amount, of data; however, of that, we\nneed at most 10\u00b0 bytes of information. Nevertheless,\ndata reduction is very difficult and computationally\nintensive. Usually we receive almost raw data and\nextensive computations are necessary to extract the\nrequired information in computer centers on the\nground, often with human help.\n\nHere it becomes clear that information must have a\npurpose, in contrast to data. Only for a certain purpose\nor with a defined intention can one extract informa-\ntion from data. However, from the same data one can\nextract different information for different purposes.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:38 PM\n",
    "385": "CHO04.indd Sec1:364\n\n364\n\nThe trend is to reduce the amounts of data to be\nstored and transmitted. This requires higher computing\nperformance and smarter algorithms. The target is to\nsave and transmit only the required information, and\nnot the complete raw data. We can see this effect espe-\ncially in hyperspectral and SAR (radar) images. These\napplications generate several gigabytes (10\u00b0) or even\nterabytes (10!\u201d) of data per second. To save and trans-\nmit the raw data would be a huge waste of resources.\nHence the data processing and information extraction\nhave to be done on-board of the spacecraft.\n\nOn the control system side the trend is to imple-\nment higher autonomy on-board the spacecraft\nso that operational expenses on the ground can be\nreduced. The spacecraft should be able to execute\nautonomously all actions to fulfill its mission over\nlong time periods.\n\nToday, some satellites can already plan their activi-\nties for the coming hours or days autonomously. This\nis of special importance for deep-space missions where\nhuman intervention is very difficult. An autonomous\nmission which is able to operate independently for\nseveral days must have high computing performance\nto be able to plan and reduce the accumulated data\nto (a few) required information bytes.\n\nRatio of Computing Performance to Frequency\n\nFortunately, the more complicated the operations\nare, the more time is available (not only needed) for\n\nAutonomous,\n\nstable and\nsafe\nPPienning\nStable and\nVital control :\nStable and + =\nunsafe\n\u2018\nUnstable and\nFigure 4.6.2: Typical opera- Unsafe\ntions, their complexity and _\nfrequency.\n\nES\n\n0.1.1 Hz\n\n2.10 Hz\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nthe computations. For example, Figure 4.6.2 refers to\nthe control of a robot arm. With a frequency of 5000\ntimes per second sensors collect data like position and\nforces on the joints (5 kHz). These operations are very\nsimple; it is just a matter of registering the signals and\nstoring them.\n\nThe next layer with a frequency range around\n1kHz contains steering or servo control activities.\nThe sensor data is filtered to reduce the noise, then\na certain position, force or speed is held constant.\nDeviations must be compensated rapidly. Often the\nservo control is executed on a dedicated simple pro-\ncessing unit which is attached directly to the actuator\n(in this example, in every joint). These operations are\nmore complicated than the ones described above, but\nthey require a sampling frequency of only 1 kHz and\nnot 5 kHz.\n\nThe next layer contains the control activities.\nThe task is to determine the desired attitude, namely,\ndesired position, desired force or desired speed, which\nshould be maintained as predefined. These operations\nare more complicated; however, they may be executed\nwith a lower frequency: between 100 and 2 times per\nsecond. In the example of the robot arm, this layer\nmust coordinate all joints to reach a certain target or\nmove in a desired trajectory. Another example is the\nattitude control of a satellite or spacecraft, where this\nlayer must control, for example, three or four reaction\nwheels in such a way that a certain attitude is held or\n\nComplexity of Frequency of\noperations operations\n\n2/24/09 3:43:39 PM\n",
    "386": "4.6 Data Management\n\nthat the satellite turns to a certain position/attitude.\nThe control must evaluate data from several sensors\nand thus control several actuators.\n\nThe next layer is the planning or autonomy acti-\nvities. This activity comprises the planning of what\nactivities must be performed during the next time\nperiod respecting predefined constraints; for exam-\nple, the satellite should point its solar cells to the Sun,\ncharge batteries and, when it flies over a certain goal,\ntake and store images, then wait until it has a ground\ncontact and transmit the images to the ground station.\nThis could be a plan to be autonomously executed.\nSelecting the target coordinates for taking images could\nlikewise be a job for the autonomy module. In this case\nthe planning component must \u201cknow\u201d the purpose\nof the mission and which constraints have to be kept.\nFor example, the spacecraft should scan the complete\nEarth, excluding the oceans, but the battery charge\nmay never fall below a certain value; in particular, the\nbattery must be fully charged before entry into the\nshadow of the Earth. Today, operations on this layer\nare mostly executed by people; however, the trend is\nto execute the planning on-board automatically. The\nplanning is a very complicated task, but it requires a\nlower frequency, in the range of minutes or hours.\n\nTrend 2: Central versus Distributed Processing\n\nTraditionally, many components produced by the\nspacecraft industry (likewise by car manufacturers)\nhave their own control computer. As a consequence,\nthe space segment contains many computers from\nmany different manufacturers. The car industry has\nthe same problem and tries to counteract this trend\nbecause the associated complexity is no longer con-\ntrollable and the system becomes unreliable. There\nare many initiatives against this trend, and almost all\nautomobile producers support one or more of them.\nAs an example, AUTOSAR tries to create a uniform\nsoftware environment. The aim is that the control of\nany device should be able to run and be executed on\nany computer in the car, and not just on a dedicated\ncomputer for the particular device. This trend already\ncasts its shadow over the aerospace industry, in parti-\ncular for micro-, pico- and nanosatellites, because the\nusual approach where \u201cevery device has its own con-\ntrol computer\u201d can no longer be scaled down. Digital\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:365\n\n365\n\nchips are already very small and economical, but this\nis still not sufficient for pico- and nanosatellites, where\nthe available space, the allowed weight and the energy\nare very limited.\n\nFor very limited resources one must abandon the\napproach where \u201cevery device has its own controller,\u201d\nbecause it is not efficient. Resource sharing with\nintelligent software for resource management has to\nbe implemented. The same hardware platform must\nbe used for the control of many devices and for the\nexecution of applications on the spacecraft bus as well\nas on the payload side. For example, on the main bus:\ntelemetry, attitude control, navigation, power control,\netc. For the payload we could have pattern recognition,\nimage processing, classifications, etc. All these func-\ntions can be executed on one single computer.\n\nFor more complex spacecraft, different approaches\nare followed today. Some try to distribute the complete\nfunctionality to different processors, while others try to\ncreate a powerful central computer. Both approaches\nhave advantages and disadvantages. With distributed\nfunctionality a failure will not immobilize the complete\nsatellite, unless it concerns a vital function.\n\nAnother trend is to separate vital functions from\nextra (nice-to-have) functions. Vital functions (critical)\nare more difficult to be implemented and certified.\nTherefore, they should run totally independently of the\nnice-to-have functions. Preferably they should run on\ndifferent processors to avoid any kind of interference.\nAnother extreme is \u201ca very critical function shall have\nits own processor.\u201d Some try to achieve the same goal\nby implementing several software virtual processors on\na single processor (time-space partitioning).\n\nWith a centralized approach the on-board compu-\nter can bea processor pool which provides dependable\nstorage and computing performance for all devices\nand applications. A network of (software) tasks can\nbe distributed in this processor pool. Tasks replace\ntraditional processors for each and every device. One\ncould say that the tasks implement virtual processors\nfor all devices. Payload tasks and other applications\nare likewise executed.

Figure 4.6.3 shows\nthe rise and decline of control technologies, first\nimplemented by means of mechanical parts, then\ngoing to more electronic (analog) components, and\nnow toward software. The graphics refer only to the\ncontrol and not to the function. It is not practical to\nreplace the tires of a car with software; however, the\ncomplete motor control can be implemented with\nsoftware.\n\nMechanical controls have been replaced by electro-\nnic controls, for example analog technology. Electronic\ncontrols are being replaced by software controls. The\nsoftware runs on electronic components (computer\nelements like CPU, memory, etc.), but the functionality\nof such components is not increasing; they are limited\n\n4 to logical and arithmetic operations, storage and data\ntransmission (networks).\n\nBesides the traditional sequential software which\nis executed on a CPU, the next variant is emerging:\nFPGA programming (Free Programmable Gate\nArray programming). FPGAs are chips that provide\nmillions of unconnected elementary logical operators\n(AND, OR, XOR, register). These operators are inter-\nconnected by programming. A complex functionality\ncan be implemented by interconnecting such simple\nlogical operators. The connections are configured not\nby hand but by a compiler for a special programming\n\nControl\n4 Implemented in\n100%\nFigure 4.6.3: Historical 0%\ntimeline of the applica-\n\nmechanics, hydraulics,pneumatics\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nlanguage, for example VHDL and Verilog. Then\nthis program is translated (synthesized) to FPGA\nconnections.\n\nThe shifting of functionality toward software is\nextremely interesting in space applications, because\nsoftware has no mass, needs no space, uses no power\nand can be reloaded from the ground. But the intro-\nduction of software often presents more difficulties\nthan expected. In many (small) space projects there are\nbarely any software engineers; hence, the complexity\nof software development is underestimated, almost\nwithout exception. As a consequence the software is\nneglected at the beginning of project planning and\ntoward the end the project is always on the critical\npath. This usually causes substantial schedule delays\nand higher costs.\n\n4.6.1.3 Interconnection Topologies\n\nIn general the data management system consists\nof several communicating computers which are\nconnected to several input and output devices. The\ninterconnection structure is called topology and\nthere are countless variations of such structures. Very\nsimple devices without their own processor must be\nconnected directly to a computer, perhaps using an\nanalog/digital converter, or relays. More complex\ndevices mostly have a (simple) integrated processor\nwhich implements a communication protocol.

Figure 4.6.4 shows some possibilities to\nconnect devices to on-board computers.\n\nWith the star topology every device has its private\nconnection to/from the on-board computer. This\nmakes communication easier and safer, because the\nfailure of a device has no effect on the communication\nwith the other devices. The disadvantage is the large\nnumber of connections required.\n\nAbus topology (e.g., CAN bus) is more economical,\nit needs only one connection to/from the on-board\ncomputer for many devices, and the number of lines\nis minimal. The disadvantage is that the failure of one\ndevice could block the entire communication exchange\nin the system. Hence, the bus has to be redundant.\nFurthermore, it should be possible to separate defec-\ntive devices from the bus in case of failure. Another\ndisadvantage is that all devices must have the same\ncommunication protocol (and the same speed). There\nare many standardized buses which are supported by\n\n367\n\nmany devices. Within embedded systems the CAN bus\n(originally from the automotive industries) is used\nvery often.\n\nHowever, the world is not black and white;\nmixtures of both topologies are mostly used.\n\nFor fault tolerance reasons the on-board computer\nconsists mostly of several identical computers\ncommunicating with each other. The interconnec-\ntion structure between communicating computers is\nbased on a different principle than the interconnection\nbetween computers and devices. Here a master-slave\nhierarchy exists. The computer (master) controls\nand the device (slave) reacts accordingly. Within the\ninterconnection structure for computers, all nodes\n(computers) are equal partners.

Some manufacturers\noffer the possibility to synthesize different CPUs [4.6.3],\n[4.6.4], while others integrate up to four fixed CPUs\ninto the FPGA chip [4.6.2]. It thereby becomes possible\nto think about SOC (System on One Chip). The target\nis to integrate the complete computer into a single chip.\nFigure 4.6.8 shows two approaches toward SOC.\n\nFPGAs can implement almost the complete logic\nof the computer, but their storage possibilities are\nrelatively limited.

Extra precautions against radiation\neffects must be implemented for space applications.\nThe easiest solution would be to block the radiation,\nfor instance with a thick box of lead. However, this\nis not practicable because of the huge mass and the\nspace requirements for the box. In addition, some\nradiation particles (ions) carrying very high energy\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:369\n\nFigure 4.6.8: Possible\narchitectures for a \u201csys-\ntem on one chip\u201d (SOC).\n\ncould penetrate the box. Hence, other protective\nprecautions are necessary.\n\nCosmic radiation consists of protons, alpha\nparticles, heavy ions, electrons and neutrons. In\nminiaturized circuits three kinds of damage can be\ncaused by these particles [4.6.9]: totally ionizing\ndose (TID) damage, single event upset (SEU) and\nsingle event latchup (SEL).\n\nThe TID causes rapid aging of the silicon com-\nponents.

If\nthis occurs the component has failed permanently.\nThe TID is measured (even today) in krad (kilorads\nof radiation absorbed dose, or the energy dose). The\nradiation intensity depends on the orbit. For low\nEarth orbits (below 800km) one can assume 3 to\n10 krad per year if protection is provided by a2mm\naluminum shield. Normal electronic components\nsurvive approximately 30krad and space-certified\ncomponents (radiation hardened) are designed for\na dose of 300 krad. For comparison, | krad is deadly\nfor humans.\n\nAs mentioned, SEU and SEL are both single event\neffects (SEEs). They are caused by single high-energy\nparticles impacting or penetrating the semiconductor\nmaterial. The adjacent material absorbs the energy and\nan ionization track is created. If this happens within\na flip-flop switch or a memory cell, a change of state\nmight occur (from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1). This causes a\ndata corruption by SEU. SEUs cause only data damage;\nthe component itself will not be damaged. One must\nexpect 10 SEUs per day. To prevent this data damage,\none has to implement some kind of redundancy code\nor create redundant data.\n\nSELs are current spikes which can damage com-\nponents permanently.

The only possible\nprecautions against TID are to screen the parts used\nand to select robust hardware components. Data\nredundancy helps in recognizing corrupted data and\ncorrecting it as a measure to counteract SEUs. As\nprotection against SEL, the complete circuit must be\nswitched off within a millisecond after detection of\nthe occurrence. A couple of seconds later it can be\nswitched on again.\n\nSEL can cause a sudden power spike which under\ncertain circumstances might be only a little higher\nthan the normal current. The latchup protection\n(current monitoring) must recognize such spikes\nand must switch off everything immediately. To be\nable to recognize the spike it is advisable to monitor\nall components separately.\n\nData in memory and in FPGA registers can be\nprotected by redundancy. Redundant codes (EDC\ncodes) allow data corruption to be recognized and 1\nbit per entry (register) to be corrected. The simplest\nway to verify the correct execution of the logic is to\nreplicate it two or three times on-board and compare\nall results.\n\nLatchup protection\n\noo V/O Replication\n\nFigure 4.6.9: Measures\nto protect a computer\nagainst the effects of\ncosmic radiation.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:44 PM\n",

Inside LEON-FT every\nfunction and every register is replicated three times\n(TMR, Triple-Module Redundancy). After every\noperation all three results are compared; if one is\ndifferent, it is immediately corrected. LEON-FT is\nsafe, but slow. Another alternative is to use standard\nCOTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) processors and\nto build the required redundancy externally or by\nreplication in software. For example, two or three\nprocessors can gather their results and compare them.\nWith the software one can execute every function two\nor three times and compare the results. It is more\neconomical to check only results against plausibility\nrules. A very simple and economical measure is to use\nwatchdogs; for every function a maximum allowable\nduration is defined. The watchdog has to be triggered\nwithin this time period, otherwise it will execute a\nreset of the computer. After this a recovery action\nhas to take place.\n\n4.6.3 Software\n\nSoftware is only information and has no physical\nrepresentation or properties. Because the subsystems\nof a spacecraft are measured according to their physi-\ncal properties (mass, space, power consumption, life\nexpectations, imaging, etc.), it is very difficult to treat\n\nComplexity\n\nsoftware as a subsystem like all the others. In addition,\nthere are no unequivocal metrics for software. Today\nthere are approx. 400 metrics to measure the properties\nof software, but they are very controversial and are not\ngenerally accepted.\n\nAll this makes software rather unfathomable.\nOne only knows that software is immaterial, abstract,\ncomplex, everywhere, big, expensive and error prone.\nDealing with mechanical components, one can re-\ncognize complexity and thorough craftwork at first\nsight. With software it is not so simple. Nevertheless,\nsoftware is at the core of every space mission and the\nfastest growing component measured in terms of\ncomplexity and development cost. The same applies\nto the car industry. While 22% of the added value of\na car in 2004 was contributed by software, this value\nis expected to increase to 36% in 2009.\n\n4.6.3.1 Problems with Software\n\nProgress in information technology is rapid: chip\ncapacity doubles every 18 months and the systems\ncan be made smaller.

Until this day there is no measure\nfor complexity, hence lines of code are used. For com-\nparison, the human capacity to completely understand\na program code probably lies at 5000 LOC (5 K-LOC)\n[4.6.5] (see Table 4.6.1).\n\nIt becomes clear that no one can handle this com-\nplexity completely; hence, it is currently not possible\nto develop perfect software. The biggest challenge in\nsoftware development is to reduce and control the\ncomplexity.\n\nBesides complexity, the next big problem with\nsoftware development is the required know-how\nof the developers. Spacecraft software contains the\ntotal knowledge of the complete mission. This is\nthe combined knowledge of the involved computer\nscientists, electrical engineers, mathematicians, physi-\ncists, mechanical engineers and space engineers. This\ninterdisciplinary collaboration often introduces more\ndifficulties than originally expected, because all these\nspecialists speak different (technical) languages and\nit takes a long time to understand all the technical\naspects.\n\nSoftware is decisive for the success or failure of\na space mission.

The example of the BIRD satellite will be\nused to show how complexity can nevertheless be\nreduced.\n\nWith the goal of reducing complexity, the BIRD\nOperating System (BOSS) [4.6.6] was originally deve-\nloped for the BIRD mission. BOSS and its middle-\nware (see Section 4.6.3.4) were developed with the\ngoals of achieving the highest possible reliability and\nimplementing a level of complexity which cannot\nbe reduced further. For every function there is a\ntheoretical lower limit of complexity required for its\nrealization. It cannot be made simpler without de-\nstroying the functionality, but it can always be made\nmore complex. Finding the sweet spot of no longer\nreducible complexity is extraordinarily difficult, but\nremains the goal of BOSS.\n\nBOSS consists of about 4000 lines of code. Current\nreal-time kernels consist of about 1 million lines of\ncode. Nevertheless, BOSS and its middleware have all\nthe functionality required to implement embedded\nreal-time systems. In contrast to the current trend,\nBOSS and its middleware are getting smaller without\nlosing functionality. The current version of BOSS\nhas about half the lines of code of the first version,\nalthough the current functionality is higher than\nbefore. For every single component the question is\nasked whether it can be made simpler, while nobody\nis trying to make it more complex (or elegant). This\nprocedure goes against the current trend. The impor-\ntant point is that every developer can understand the\nentire BOSS implementation, and does not have to\nassume anything as a black box.\n\n4.6.3.3 Software Functions and Requirements\n\nPayload or mission science software is somehow dif-\nferent from the bus control software which runs on\nthe on-board computer. The function of the payload\nsoftware is data reduction and data management. The\npayload software is supposed to extract information\nfrom the data provided by the sensors (e.g., cameras,\nradar and other sensors). These applications are mostly\nnumerical computations or number-crunching tasks\nwith a large amount of data. Some applications require\non-the-fly data processing. This means that sensor\ndata should be processed as soon as it is provided\n\nCH04.indd Sec1:373\n\n373\n\nby the sensor, that is before the data is stored. This is\nthe case when the data rate is too high for storage. In\nother cases it is possible to first store data from the\nsensors and then to process it in batches, maybe in the\nspacecraft or maybe on the ground.\n\nThe satellite bus control software (in the on-board\ncomputer) usually fulfills mostly control and steering\nfunctions, which should be computed on a real-time\nbasis. Typically these functions are split into three\ngroups:\n\n1. Booting, initialization and loading programs\n2. Real-time operating system\n3. Applications.\n\nThe boot program (booter) must reside in a non-\nvolatile memory (e.g., flash or ROM). After every\npower-on and every reset command the boot program\nis activated and executed before any other function.\nIt must initialize the hardware and then load the\noperating system and, if foreseen, the appropriate\napplications. When loading new software, the booter\ncopies it to memory (RAM), initializes it and jumps\nto the start entry of the loaded software. Then the\nloaded software takes control. The operating system\ncan likewise be saved in the same flash memory, or\nthe boot program can load it from the network or\ndisk. For space applications the boot program and\nthe operations system usually are stored on the same\nflash memory.\n\nThe real-time operating system administers the\nresources of the computer, the time and the applica-\ntions. It controls the I/O devices using I/O drivers.\nModern operating systems provide middleware which\nimplements the communications between the appli-\ncations. Middleware helps make it possible for appli-\ncations to be developed and operated independently\nof each other. Without middleware the applications\nwould have to communicate directly with each other,\noften by means of common variables. This method\nresults in a strong dependence between applications,\nwhich makes the system more complex.\n\nThe (user) applications run on top of the ope-\nrating system and middleware. They have the task\nto check and control the different subsystems of the\nspacecraft. Applications for the payload segment vary\nfor every mission, as explained above. However, for\n\n2/24/09 3:43:46 PM\n",

Supervision Module (Surveillance): The surveil-\nlance module checks the current state of all vital\nsubsystems and compares the relevant parame-\nters with predefined limits which should not be\nexceeded during nominal operations.

The correctness of real-time\ntasks not only consists of the generation of a correct\noutput value, but also has to be generated at the right\npoint in time and not simply \u201cas fast as possible,\u201d\nsuch as an alarm clock which should ring around\n06:15: its correct output is not only \u201criiinnnnggg,\u201d\nbut \u201criinnnggg\u201d around 06:15, it must not be exactly\n06:15:00.000; there is a response time window with\na certain tolerance, for example the ring would be\nsatisfactory between 6:12 and 6:18. The end of the\ntime window is the deadline (not later). In connec-\ntion with real-time definitions, only the deadlines\nare mentioned; the beginning of the time windows\nis often ignored. For example, if somebody wants to\njump onto a train, it is bad to jump too late (behind\nthe train), but even worse to jump too early (in front\nof the train)!\n\n\u201cReal time\u201d says nothing about speed. Some\napplications have very long periods and other very\nshort periods. For example, an alarm clock which must\nring at a certain time every day would be a real-time\napplication with a period of 24 hours. A charging\nsystem which should print invoices at the end every\nmonth and mail them is likewise a real-time applica-\ntion with a frequency of 12 times per year. In contrast,\nthe frequency control of an electron accelerator can\nbe up to 1 million times per second (1 MHz). Typical\ncontrol tasks in satellites have frequencies in the range\nof 1 Hz (not very fast).\n\nIn general computer-controlled tasks are imple-\nmented as parallel tasks reacting in real time.

Read sensor measurements: the current state of\nthe controlled equipment is determined.\n\n2. Compute: the control reaction to the events is\ncomputed.\n\n3. Address the actuators: the computed reaction is\nimplemented as an action.\n\nThe periods and the limitations of the time require-\nments are different for steering tasks and for control\ntasks (see Figure 4.6.2). The steering tasks have a\nrelatively high frequency ranging from 100 Hz up to\n30 kHz (30000 times per second) but are easy to calcu-\nlate. In space applications a frequency of 1 kHz (within\nthe servo control of the devices) is very common. The\ncontrol tasks have relatively low frequencies, but are\nmore complicated to calculate. Their frequency might\nrange between 1 Hz and 1000 Hz. In space applications\na frequency of 2Hz is usual. Thermal checks, for\nexample, can have in contrast a period of 30 seconds\n(temperature changes relatively slowly).\n\nClassification of Real-Time Tasks\n\nTypically a control job is split into tasks running in\nparallel. Some of them can run periodically (cyclic)\nand others aperiodically. For periodic tasks the three\nphases mentioned above have to fit into a given time\nwindow.\n\nThe aperiodic tasks are activated as sporadic tasks\nby asynchronous external events (interrupts) or as\nspontaneous reactions to internal events. All tasks\nhave an initialization function which is called up once\nat system start, and a \u201chandle\u201d function which is called\nup for every activation of the task. The ongoing tasks\nrun in the background without time requirements.\n\nDependability\n\n375\n\nThey execute long-time computations which are not\ntime constrained or check system states whenever the\ncomputer is in idle mode.\n\nTime-critical or hard real-time tasks have fixed\ndeadlines or response time windows which may not\nbe missed. If the reaction does not take place in the\nintended response time windows, the system fails,\ncausing unwanted effects: for example, not switching\noff the heat source of a boiler before it explodes.\nSwitching off a millisecond after this hard deadline\nis of no help.\n\nFor the soft real-time tasks or time-sensitive tasks\nthe response time window is not defined as strictly as\nfor the time-critical tasks. The response time window\nis to be interpreted rather as a desirable time. For ex-\nample, turning on a heating system if the temperature\ngoes below 19\u00b0C is not so time critical as the case of\navoiding an explosion. If it takes place some seconds\nor even minutes later or earlier, it does not mean that\nthe system has failed.\n\n4.6.4 Dependability\n\nSpacecraft anomalies and failures have to be expected.\n\nHowever, the spacecraft must continue its mission\n\ndespite anomalies. This is called dependability [4.6.7].\n\nDependability, as shown in Figure 4.6.12, consists of:\n\ne Safety: No catastrophic consequences and no\ndanger should come from the system.\n\ne Reliability: Continuity of service without inter-\nruption.\n\ne Availability: Readiness of the system to be used.\n\ne Confidentiality: Protection against information\nabuse.\n\ne Integrity: Protection against information cor-\nruption.\n\nSafety Reliability Availability\n\nFigure 4.6.12: Pillars of\n\nConfidentiality dependability.\n\nIntegrity\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:375\n\n4\n\n2/24/09 3:43:47 PM\n",
    "397": "CHO4.indd Sec1:376\n\n376\n\nWhen a failure of the control system can have ca-\ntastrophic or life-threatening consequences the control\nsystem has to provide ultrahigh dependability: This\nmeans a maximum of 10\u00b0 failures per hour may\noccur, or, in other words, a maximum of one failure\nin 10\u00b0 hours of operation is allowed. This means only\none failure in 114000 years of operation! Such ultra-\nhigh dependability cannot be guaranteed with today\u2019s\ntechnology, but many control systems have to be (and\nare) certified according to this measure. In the satellite\nbusiness a failure has (normally) no life-threatening\nconsequences, only loss of high investments. For such\nsystems a dependability of \u201conly\u201d 10\u00b0 to 10\u201d failures\nper hour is tolerable. In contrast, human space missi-\nons require a dependability of 10~\u00b0 failures per hour.\n\nTo achieve the highest possible dependability\nin embedded control systems and to avoid possible\nfailures it is recommended to:\n\n1. Minimize the probability of malformations.\n2. Recognize and handle anomalies while the system\nis running.\n\nTo satisfy these two points the three approaches listed\n\nbelow should be followed [4.6.6]:\n\n1. Search for the lowest possible complexity: make the\ndesign as simple as possible because the main cause\nof malfunctions and failures is high complexity.\n\n2. Implement fast and safe recovery strategies for\neach possible anomaly.\n\n3. Optimize redundancy and redundancy manage-\nment. It is possible to have reliable systems in\nspite of unreliable components. Redundancy\nalone does not enhance dependability; more\nimportant is redundancy management, which\ndecisively influences the design of software and\nhardware from the beginning to the end of the\ndevelopment.\n\nIf a system has been certified as very reliable and safe it\nmeans only that very few failures can occur. Absolute\nreliability (a system which never fails) is not possible\nin technical systems. Always be aware of anomalies!\n\nAn error is the cause of undesirable results and\ncan lie with people (operators) or machines. The envi-\nronment can also introduce unexpected circumstances\ncausing undesirable results. All this is summarized in\nthe term anomalies (errors and surprises).\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nAll components of a system are error prone. But\nnot all components are endangered in the same way.\nMechanical errors which can lead to catastrophic\nconsequences are primarily caused by control errors.\nMost of them come from unpredictable situations.\nA second category of failures is caused by mistakes\nin the development (mostly in the software, because\nof its complexity). A third source for malfunctions is\nmechanical wear and tear as well as failures of elec-\ntronic components.\n\nErrors can be classified as follows:\n\ne Source: development errors or runtime error\ne Behavior: permanent or sporadic errors\ne Category: value or time errors.\n\nA fault-tolerant system should fulfill its function\neven after the occurrence of faults, errors and internal\nfailures. It may contain errors; however, it may not\npropagate them or make them visible. Any internal\nerror, failure or disturbances must not show external\neffects.\n\nA safe system may interrupt/discontinue its func-\ntion, but it may not pose any danger. If a fault-tolerant\nsystem can no longer perform its function, say, after\nmany failures, control of the system cannot simply\nbe lost; the system must rather be configured to a\nsafe, stable state and remain there until help can be\nprovided.\n\nActive modules, such as processors, are masters\nand can act independently. In contrast, slave modules\n(simple I/O devices, sensors, actuators) do not act\nindependently; they only react to commands from\nmaster modules. Therefore, anomalies from active\nmodules can spread faster in the system and cause\nfurther anomalies in other modules. An active module\nis able to disturb other modules by sending messages,\nbus accesses, entries in other memories, etc. The con-\nsequences of these anomalies are more dramatic when\nthe modules also directly control the actuators.\n\nModule errors can be handled internally in each\nmodule; otherwise, errors will be visible outside the\nmodule (they have visible consequences) and must\nbe handled externally. For internal error handling\nthe processors and all other module components\nmust implement redundancy requirements. For exter-\nnal error handling the modules can be implemen-\nted to be redundant by replication. The results and\n\n2/24/09 3:43:48 PM\n",
    "398": "4.6 Data Management\n\nactions of redundant modules must be compared\npermanently to detect and handle anomalies. This\ncomparison function (voter) can be implemented as\ndedicated hardware or executed in the same processor\nmodules.\n\n4.6.4.1 Module-Internal Handling of Errors\n\nInternal error detection and handling must cover all\n\nmodule components:\n\n1. The processor, mostly in the form of a microcon-\ntroller\n\n2. The memory\n\n3. I/O and network connections.\n\nNormal microcontrollers have a high degree of inte-\ngration, but normally no support for internal error\ndetection and handling. Coarse mistakes, for example\nif the processor gets stuck or goes astray, can be detec-\nted by a watchdog logic. A counteraction could be\nto perform a module reset. For a more sophisticated\nsupervision scheme one must duplicate (or even\ntriplicate) the central processing unit (duplex central\nprocessing unit). In this case all replicas must perform\nthe same function at the same time; therefore, the\nbehavior of the CPUs can be compared externally.\n\nTransient internal CPU errors can be handled by\nexecuting every software task twice. If both executions\nproduce the same results, it can be assumed that there\nwas no error. If they differ, the same task can be exe-\ncuted a third time and compared again to identify the\n(probably) right result.\n\nLEON-FT from the ESA CPU was developed\nespecially for safety-critical systems. In LEON-FT\nevery internal function is implemented three times\n(triplication) and the results are compared imme-\ndiately after each basic operation. Deviations are\ncorrected immediately.\n\nMemory and storage errors are simpler to detect\nand correct. For securing memory and storage devices\nwe can use simple parity, EDAC/EDC codes (Error\nDetection and Correction codes), CRC (Cyclic\nRedundant Code) at block level, multiple copies of\nthe data, and address range protection registers (rather\nfor software errors).\n\nBit flips in memories accumulate with time (new\nflips can occur at any time). In general EDAC can\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:377\n\n377\n\nonly correct one bit flip per word. If, however, two bit\nflips have accumulated in a single word, we can still\ndetect the error, but (normally) we cannot correct it.\nTherefore, the complete memory should be exami-\nned cyclically and every bit flip corrected as soon as\npossible, as long as it is possible.\n\n4.6.4.2 Module-External Handling by Using\nRedundant Modules\n\nThe most common and simplest method for exter-\nnal error handling is to replicate the modules as a\nwhole and externally compare their results by using\na supervisor [4.6.7]. The supervisor needs a reference\nto be able to recognize anomalies, for example for\nplausibility checks or for simply comparing the results\nof several redundant modules. But note especially\nthat the problem of comparison is difficult, because\nsmall input differences can lead to absolutely diffe-\nrent results. This happens with values near decision\nthresholds, for example\nheater() {temperature = readTemperature();\nif (temperature > 19.5) {... } else { ... }}\n\nWith a value around 19.5 a sensor tolerance of only\n0.01% can lead to huge differences, so that the results\nof two parallel running modules would no longer be\ncomparable. To solve this problem, the voter/compa-\nrator needs more information: for example, whether\na decision was near a threshold value. This makes the\ncomparison of results much more difficult.\n\nThe voter can be implemented as a dedicated pas-\nsive module (hardware) observing the active modules.\nThis increases the complexity of the system, which\nbrings new risks. What will detect a malfunction of\nthis new module (voter)? However, the voter module\nis much simpler than the active modules and therefore\nfewer errors can be expected there. In any case the\nvoter can become a single point of global failure.\n\nThe comparison task can also be performed by the\nactive modules themselves by monitoring each other\nand coming to a democratic (voting) decision if there\nare differences. This method needs a longer decision\ntime than a dedicated voter, but the implementation of\na more complex comparing mechanism is possible.\n\nAn external supervisor recognizes errors, indeed,\nlater than a module-internal supervisor; however, it\nhas more decision possibilities, such as for example\n\n2/24/09 3:43:48 PM\n",
    "399": "CH04.indd Sec1:378\n\n378\n\nthe comparison of several modules, timing checks,\nsynchronization points, communication protocols\nand checks of transmitted messages, and it also has the\npossibility to neutralize uncooperative or suspicious\nmodules (e.g., by resetting them). Figure 4.6.13 shows\ntwo possibilities to isolate uncooperative modules:\n\n1. Each bus connection of the modules has a tristate\nbuffer which is under the control of the supervision\nunit.\n\n2. Allbus connections to the bus go through resistors\n(insulators), and the supervision unit is able to inter-\nrupt the power of every module separately. This\nmethod is more economic and safer, and one can\nsave power. But the bus becomes slower and turn-\ning off modules implies loss of information and\nrequires a more complex recovery mechanism.\n\n4 4.6.4.3 Self-checking Pairs\n\nBy using only two identical, redundant, active modules\nerrors can be detected by comparing results, but they\n\nReset/\nRecovery\n\nOOEIL) Monitoring\n\nBus\n\nPower Supply\nvec\n\nPower Interrupt\n\nModule xx\nMonitoring\n\nFigure 4.6.13: Circuits for isolating faulty modules.\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\ncannot be corrected. We see the difference, but we\ncannot say which one is right and which is wrong. By\nusing three redundant modules errors can be detected,\nlocalized and corrected (two of three, a democratic\ndecision), so that a single error has no effect on the\nfollowing superior modules [4.6.7]. By using two re-\ndundant modules, a self-checking pair or trustworthy\nmodule can be built up. A trustworthy module is par-\ntially correct so that it supplies only correct results, or\nnone in the case of error. A trustworthy module alone\nis not fault tolerant, but it is a good component to build\nfault tolerance. It can also be used only as a fail-safe\nmodule. With this configuration the module should\nsupply a safe reaction (e.g., emergency stop) or start\nan emergency program if an error is detected.\n\nFigure 4.6.14 shows three possibilities for trust-\nworthy modules (A, B, C). Each module supplies not\nonly a value (result), but also a signal (OK) to confirm\nthe correctness of the value. This signal can also be\nused to isolate modules from the rest of the system in\ncase of (internal) errors.\n\n4.6.4.4 Fault-Tolerant Structures\n\nA fault-tolerant module can be built by using of two\ntrustworthy modules [4.6.7]. One of them is the pri-\nmary module (worker), the other one is a shadow\nmodule (monitor). The monitor runs in parallel\nwith the worker, but does not interfere. The primary\nmodule has control of the system until it recognizes\nan internal error or until it fails. In this case the fai-\nled module keeps silent and executes a recovery. The\nshadow module detects the failure of the worker and\nimmediately takes over the role of the worker, assu-\nming the control function for the system. When the\nfirst module is again ready for operation, it takes the\nroll of the shadow (monitor) module and remains\nsilent in readiness. If the shadow module recognizes\nan internal error, it executes a recovery in silence. The\nshadow module becomes active when it notices that\nthe expected reaction (\u201cOK\u201d signal) of the primary\nmodule does not arrive on time or after an agreement\nbetween both modules (communication protocols).\nA similar approach was implemented in the BIRD\nsatellite. In BIRD every module checks itself by soft-\nware so that the complete construction requires only\n\n2/24/09 3:43:49 PM\n",

This can happen, for\nexample, if both trustworthy modules are identical\nand have the same development error. Ironically it\nwould have been better not to recognize the error\nbecause to do nothing (no reaction of the control)\ncan be worse than doing something wrong.\n\nIt is also possible to construct directly fault-to-\nlerant modules without using trustworthy modules.\nThis is based on democratic decisions with three or\nmore redundant modules.

If all three results are different, then\nwe have a big problem.

Although\nthe following considerations refer to satellite commu-\nnication, they are in principle valid for many other\napplications.\n\nFor this reason it is necessary to address some\nfundamental principles of telecommunication to faci-\nlitate the understanding of interrelations and physical\nboundary conditions. At this point consideration\nof theoretical channel capacity and the influences\nof omnipresent thermal noise are of elementary\nimportance.\n\nThe specifications of the transmission system with\nrespect to capacity, reliability and compatibility with\nthe ground stations are crucial for the architecture\nof the on-board system. They determine the size\nand characteristics of the on-board antennas, the\nnecessary transmitting power and the sensitivity of\nthe receivers. In addition, coding and modulation are\ndirectly connected to the achievable transmission rate,\nquality and data integrity.\n\nFinally, the fully redundant communication\nsystem of the BIRD satellite is discussed, which has\nbeen successfully orbiting Earth since 2001.\n\nAll subjects addressed in the following sections\ncan only provide a small insight into the large area of\ntelecommunication.\n\n4.7.1 Introduction\n\nNowadays satellites are a central part of daily commu-\nnication. Intercontinental telephone and data links as\nwell as television transmissions are constantly in use\nand subject to competition\u2019 amongst various provi-\nders using various technologies. Hence the efficiency\nof the communication system is a significant factor\n\nEspecially by intercontinental submarine cable networks,\nemploying modern glass fiber and modulation technologies\nwith transmission bandwidths in excess of 10 terabyte per\nsecond.\n\n2/24/09 3:43:51 PM\n",
    "402": "4.7 Communication\n\nfor its design and implementation. As many users as\npossible should be able to use the same satellite link\nsimultaneously. Therefore, one tries to place as many\nchannels into the allocated frequency band as possible.\nWith the help of modern modulation methods one\ncomes constantly closer to meeting these requirements.\nLimiting factors are the available primary power (e.g.,\n7kW for ASTRA 2A) of the satellite bus, the associated\nthermal budget and the various regulations regarding\nthe radiated radio frequency.\n\nIn contrast to digital data links, the delay of voice\ntransmissions via geostationary satellite links has\na perturbing effect, especially when an additional\necho is present. Modern technology is able to cancel\na large part of this echo but reaches its limits when\nlinks extend over two satellites with a corresponding\ndoubling of the delay.\n\nModern telecommunications satellites have a design\nlifetime of up to 15 years but in reality their demise is\ndetermined by the depletion of the propellant available\nfor attitude and position control. In general, the lifetime\nof modern electronic components is longer in most\ncases, which has been demonstrated by elaborate and\ncostly tests. In addition vital subsystems (e.g., transmit-\nter, receiver and transponder) are designed with full\nredundancy that can be activated when needed.\n\nThe technology installed on-board a satellite must\nbe compatible with the transmit and receive systems of\nthe allocated ground stations, which might consist of a\nlarge number of single stations distributed worldwide.\n\nFor short-life (< 5 years) research satellites, con-\nsiderably lower cost components (commercial off the\nshelf (COTS)) and systems from other areas of space\ntechnology are being used at an increasing rate.\n\nAt the end of this chapter the transmit and receive\nsystem of the DLR BIRD (Bispectral Infra-Red Detec-\ntion) research satellite is presented, whose technology\nis mainly derived from the area of sounding rockets.\nThis system has been working faultlessly for more\nthan seven years in orbit.\n\n4.7.2 Radio Spectrum\n\nIn addition to national institutions, the European\nCooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) deter-\nmines all frequencies for communication applications\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:381\n\n381\n\nTable 4.7.1: Excerpt from a list of allocated frequencies for various\nsatellite services.\n\nBand Frequency [MHz] Service Direction\n\nS 2025-2120 SR, SO, EES Earth - Space\n2200-2300 SR, SO, EES \u2014 Space - Earth\n\nx 7145-7235 SR, SO Earth - Space\n8025-8400 EES Space - Earth\n8400-8500 SR Space - Earth\n\nK, 10.7-11.7 FSS\n12.5-12.75 BSS Space - Earth\n11.7-12.2 SMS Earth - Space\n14000-15350 SR\n16 600-17 100 SR\n\nK, 25 500-27 000 EES Space - Earth\n31800-32300 SR Space - Earth\n34200-34700 SR Earth - Space\n37000-38000 SR Space - Earth\n40000-40500 SR, EES Earth - Space\n\nin Europe. The International Telecommunication\nUnion, Geneva (ITU), is responsible for the allocation\nand coordination of frequencies (Table 4.7.1). This\nresults in partially overlapping and controversial band\nallocations for the assigned sectors. Furthermore,\none has to consider that special frequency alloca-\ntions exist for various world zones. Many frequency\nallocations for satellite communication are also used\nfor terrestrial applications. Due to the permanently\ngrowing number of services and to disturbances by\n\u201chuman-made noise,\u201d there is a trend to switch to\nhigher frequencies. Detailed frequency allocations\nare given in the publications of the ECSS and ITU\n(Article 8, Radio Regulations). Another breakdown\ncan also be found in Section 6.3.\n\n4.7.2.1 Atmospheric Attenuation\n\nHigher frequencies (= shorter wavelengths) enable\nthe use of relatively small parabolic antennas (e.g.,\nfor the ASTRA TV satellites), as the physical size of\nan antenna (effective area) is directly proportional\nto the wavelength used. However, one has to consi-\nder that shadowing effects caused by obstructions\n(no direct line of sight to the satellite) increasingly\nplay a role when high frequencies (f > 1 GHz) are\nused and in extreme cases can result in a total loss of\n\n2/24/09 3:43:51 PM\n",

The economic use of very high fre-\nquencies (f> 20 GHz) is restricted by the atmosphe-\nric absorption bands caused by water vapor and\noxygen, which leads to high link attenuation.\n\n4.7.2.2 Maximum Power Flux Density\n(from Space to Earth)\n\nEvery signal transmitted by a satellite is governed by the\nrules established by the ECSS. Besides the potential mo-\ndulation and transmitting bandwidth, the equivalent\nisotropic radiated power (EIRP) has to be limited to\ncomply with the maximum permitted incident power\nflux density produced at the Earth\u2019s surface.

In many applications quantization of 8\nto 16 bits is common. This is equivalent to a resolution\nof 40 to 0.15 mV assuming an analog signal with an\namplitude of 10V,,:\n\nfs22 fr\n\n(the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem).\n\nStringing together all quantized values results\nin a serial stream of data consisting of a number of\nwords. To enable the reverse process at the receiver\nend, a known synchronization pattern (sync words)\nis included in the serial bit stream. This entire data\nblock is called a PCM frame (Figure 4.7.9).\n\n(4.7.39)\n\nFrequency components of the wanted signal with f> ./2\nare folded to a frequency band of 0< fs f,/2. Therefore, the\noriginal signal has to be band limited before quantization\nto guarantee proper reconstruction of the original signal\nshape at the instant of digital-to-analog conversion at the\nreceiver end.\n\nCHO4.indd Sec1:391\n\n391\n\nWo Wi W2 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7 W8 W9 W10 Wii Wi2 W13 Wi4 W15\nSO} S1] At | A2 | A3 |] A4] AS | AG | A7 | AB | AQ | A10) A11]A12/A13] A14\n\nfo y+fo}1Jo]1 [1] B0|B1[B2]B3]B4]B5]B6|B7]\n\nFigure 4.7.9: PCM frame with two synchronization words (SO, 51)\nand 14 data words (analog channels A1 to A14) with a resolution\nof 8 bits/word.

This feature is obtained at the\nprice of doubling the transmission bandwidth. For\nreal applications the signal to be transmitted is band\nlimited (premodulation filtered) with a six-pole Bessel\nfilter with a cut-off frequency of f_; 43 =1.5f, prior to\nthe modulation of the carrier signal.\n\nA variety of additional codes exist (e.g., Miller or\ndelay code modulation, Miller squared code) with\nmost of them having no significant use in actual\napplications.\n\nThere is a high probability of having long trails of\nzeros and ones when using NRZ codes.\n\nThe resulting DC level of the modulating signal\npotentially can be a problem for the transmitter but\nalso for the synchronization of the bit synchronizer at\nthe receiving end. A possible remedy of this problem\nis to use a pseudo-random code (RNRZ-L) which\ncan be obtained by implementing a linear feedback\nshift register.\n\nFor this case the maximum achievable pseudo-\nrandom length is 2'\u00b0 \u2014 1 = 32767 bits. For automatic\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nsynchronization, the corresponding decoding logic\nneeds 15 consecutive error-free bits (Figure 4.7.14).\nSingle bit errors at the receiver entail two additional\nbit errors after the decoding process. In this case, the\nrespective bit error rate for a given modulation has to\nbe multiplied by a factor of 3.\n\nTo make clear the difference between NRZ-L and\nBi- @-L, the normalized spectral energy densities for\nPR-PCM are depicted in Figure 4.7.15. It is obvious\nthat for the transmission of an NRZ-L coded signal\nDC coupling is required, but frequency components\nabove the actual bit frequency can be neglected. A\nBi- @-L coded signal has no DC component but the\nfrequency components are shifted toward the bit\nfrequency, resulting in a doubling of the necessary\ntransmission bandwidth.\n\nThe envelopes show a maximum of f < 0.5f, for\nNRZ-L and a maximum for f= 0.75f, for Bi- B-L.\n\nUsing the Carson formula for calculating the\nresulting bandwidth of the carrier frequency leads to\nan erroneous result when using PCM-RNRZ-L-FM\ndue to the various frequencies at different amplitudes\nof the modulation signal (cf.

The available\ntransmission bandwidth is divided into a number of\nvirtual channels. In this way the individual data sources\n(experiments or housekeeping) have the possibility to\nuse the maximum possible data rate of the telemetry if\nneeded. To safeguard the transmission quality the data\nis coded by a Reed-Solomon encoder block prior to a\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:393\n\nconvolutional encoder. Using a 8 bit shift register with\nfeedback, the data is serialized into pseudo-random\nNRZ-L format. The transmission of the data is within\na transfer frame consisting of a fixed number of 8 bit\nwords and preceded by synchronization bits.\n\nThe largest part of this complex coding and for-\nmatting is realized by special integrated hardware\ncomponents which are qualified for space application.\nDedicated programs are available for modern CPLDs\n(Complex Programmable Logic Devices) using the\nprogramming language Verilog HDL (Verilog Hard-\nware Description Language) for implementation of\nthe CCSDS transmission standard.\n\nBy using this coding scheme the theoretical trans-\nmission capacity of the channel is closely approached\nand a net gain of >5 dB is available for the link design.\n\n4.7.9 Code Division Multiple Access\n(CDMA)\n\nIn contrast to FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple\nAccess) trying to minimize the transmitting bandwidth,\nthe transmitter power is spread over a large bandwidth\n(see Section 4.7.3) with CDMA where all users are\ntransmitting their information at the same time in a\nmultiple access channel with spread spectrum modu-\nlation. The information signal is multiplied (spread)\nwith a pseudo-random sequence and the resulting\ntransmission spectrum is similar to noise.\n\n2/24/09 3:44:04 PM\n",
    "415": "CHO04.indd Sec1:394\n\n394\n\nFor demodulation of the signal, the receiver needs\nan exact copy of the pseudo-random sequence. A\ncross-correlator continuously compares it to the re-\nceived signal and the output amplitude only reaches a\nmaximum when an exact match occurs. All users are\nable to occupy the same data channel despite mutual\ninterference because each user employs a unique and\ndistinctive code.\n\nBecause of this tolerance to interference, the use of\nCDMA permits a reduction of the channel distance\nfor satellites as well as for mobile telephones without\nsignificant loss of quality. Another advantage is the\npossibility to use smaller antennas without having to\ntolerate disturbances from neighboring satellites.\n\n4.7.10 Coupling Networks\n\nQuite often it is advantageous to operate two trans-\nmitters on one antenna system by selecting a coupling\nnetwork with a transmission loss for each channel as\nlow as possible and at the same time with a stopband\nattenuation as high as possible for the opposite chan-\nnel. The most commonly used system is the dividing/\ncombining network realized with high-quality band-\npass sections and thus providing high selectivity for\neach channel. One major drawback of these units is the\nvoltage overshoot within the individual filter sections\nand the associated risk of flashovers (corona effect at\nlow pressures in the region of 10\u00b0 to 10\u201dPa). To elimi-\nnate this risk it is necessary to design the unit to be\nabsolutely hermetically sealed or to allow for complete\noutgassing (e.g., in satellites) of the system before\nits first use. Due to the relatively short exposure to\nvacuum, the employment of unsealed filter networks\nfor use on sounding rockets is not possible.\n\nFor these applications the phase line coupler is an\nattractive solution. It consists of two 90\u00b0 couplers (four\npoles) which are connected in series. One connection\nis direct while the other connection is implemented\nwith a phase line.\n\nWhen choosing the electrical length /, of the cable\nso that the resulting phase for frequency f, is 0\u00b0 and\nsimultaneously 180\u00b0 phase for frequency f,, then both\nsignals are directed (with low losses) to the antenna\nport \u201cAnt\u201d (see Figure 4.7.17):\n\n. =(n + 0.5) Ay =n dy (4.7.42)\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nf\u2014+ or/90\u00b0 0\u00b0/90\u00b0 Ant\nCoupler Coupler\n\nae .\n\nFigure 4.7.17: Fundamental construction of a phase line coupler.\n\nwith ne Gand at the same time as small as possible.\nDeviations result in a phase error \u00ae and consequently\nin higher overall losses.\n\nThe signal power at the ports is\nPay 2 |Ve fat {14 2-d-cosl@(f,)] +a}\n\ntA 1 (4.7.43)\n\nBoas |Vaf at 1-2-d-cosl@( f+} (4.7.44)\n\nwhere:\na= transmission loss of one 90\u00b0 coupler,\nd= cable attenuation of the phase line.\n\nDue to its small physical dimension, but also\nbecause of economic considerations, the phase line\ncoupler was used for the BIRD satellite to couple one\ntransmitter and one receiver with very low losses to a\ncommon antenna (see Figures 4.7.18 and 4.7.19).\n\nBIRD Phase Line Coupler\n\nLoss [dB\n\n30\n2000 2025 2050 2075 2100 2125 2150 2175 2200 2225 2250\nFrequeny [MHz]\n\n== Insertion Loss RX\nInsertion Loss TX\n\nFigure 4.7.18: Phase line coupler for BIRD.

This dose is equivalent to the calculated expo-\nsure of the BIRD satellite during its intended lifetime\nwithout taking into account the additional shielding\n\nCHO04.indd Sec1:395\n\nFigure 4.7.19: Block\ndiagram showing the\nredundant BIRD receive/\ntransmit system compri-\nsing a high-gain antenna\nfor transmission of spec-\ntral images and a low-\ngain antenna for low data\nrate, omnidirectional co-\nverage.

In each case a transmitter and a\nreceiver are coupled to a common antenna port with\na passive low-loss (< 0.8dB) phase line coupler. The\nactual physical cable length of the phase line is only\n= 61cm with n = 6 because of the large difference\nbetween transmit and receive frequencies. While both\nreceivers are permanently in operation, the active\ntransmitter can be selected. By means of the transfer\nrelay (changeover switch) each transmit/receive unit\ncan be connected either to the helix antenna (G= 0 dBi)\n\n4\n\n2/24/09 3:44:06 PM\n",

The\nsecond transfer switch is provided for redundancy\nreasons only.\n\nThe actual stopband attenuation of the phase line\ncoupler is in the order of ~ 27dB and consequently\nnot large enough for sufficient decoupling of the\ntransmit and receive paths. With simple additional\nseries resonance filters at the transmitter output\nf= fax and at the receiver input f. = fry the decoup-\nling can be improved to > 50dB. This eliminates\ninterfering broadband transmitter noise or a too large\ntransmitter signal appearing at the receiver input.\n\nThe modulation of the S-band transmitters\n(frx = 2201.707 MHz) is PCM-Bi- \u00ae-L-BPSK for\nboth possible bit rates (2.2 Mbit/s for image data and\n137.5 kbit/s for housekeeping data).\n\nThe uplink modulation is Gaussian minimum\nshift keying (GMSK) PM with a constant bit rate of\n19.2 kbit/s and forward error correction, implemented\nwith the half-duplex packet data modem CMX900\nfrom Consumer Microcircuits Limited.\n\nTrue FM double-superheterodyne receivers with\nan additional linear integrator stage after the demo-\ndulator allow for correct reception of the PM data\npackets. In comparison to PM receivers it is much\nmore economical to use true FM receivers for this\napplication as this approach eliminates the need of\nsophisticated synchronization and verification logic\nfor the lock on the received RF signal.\n\nThe frequency shift caused by the Doppler effect\n(= 50kHz) of the received RF signal has to be accoun-\nted for in addition to the modulation when specifying\nthe bandwidth of the receiver IF filter.\n\nThe achievable system sensitivity is quite satisfac-\ntory for commanding the BIRD satellite in LEO.\n\n4.7.11.2 Telemetry Downlink Budget\n\nThe detailed link budget for the BIRD satellite is\nlisted in Table 4.7.2. Worst case conditions have been\nused for all assumed values, for example allowing\nfor reduced transmitter power at maximum tempe-\nrature or for an adverse antenna diagram. For the\n\n4 Subsystems of Spacecraft\n\nreceiving and transmitting stations, the actual values\nof an experimental 2 m ground station are used. No\nadditional margin is required with these specifica-\ntions as all operational ground stations have a much\nlarger figure of merit for the uplink and downlink.\nThe actual difference can be directly added to the\ncontingency.\n\nDuring the transmission of the scientific data,\nthe on-board helix antenna is nadir oriented. When\nthe satellite is rising above the horizon (0\u00b0 elevation\nof the receiving station), the aspect angle onto the\nantenna diagram is ~ 24\u00b0 (elevation angle @ of the\nhelix antenna). For simplicity of calculation all values\nare used in their logarithmic form as multiplication\nreduces to addition and division to subtraction (see\nalso Section 6.3.4.8).\n\nTo verify that the maximum permitted power flux\ndensity on the ground (ITU regulation) is not violated,\nFigures 4.7.2 and 4.7.20 are used. Assuming favorable\nconditions, the result shows that it is possible to receive\nimage data from the BIRD satellite with a 2 m parabolic\nantenna above an elevation angle of 2 5\u00b0.

Putting humans into space can significantly\nimprove the flexibility of research and operations as\ncompared to robotic applications. Humans can interact\nwith the systems and payloads, perform tasks which\nhave not been defined in all their detail before a mission\nand communicate with scientists while carrying out the\ntasks of the mission. The presence of humans in space\nis a valuable resource which can be complemented by\nautomation and robotic systems.\n\nHowever, the consequence of this is, that signifi-\ncant technical support is required to allow humans to\nwork and live there and to protect them against the\nhostile space environment.\n\nThe design drivers for human systems are robust-\nness, reliability, safety, failure tolerance and ease of\noperation. Also, special functions such as caution\nand warning, safe haven and rescue systems must\nbe considered. All systems must be designed so that\nthey support the presence of astronauts. This includes\nsupporting systems as well as payloads in terms of\ntheir access, interfaces, etc.\n\nAstronauts must be accommodated in a pressuri-\nzed shell with a supply of oxygen, removal of carbon\ndioxide, temperature and humidity control.\n\nThe design is significantly impacted by human\nfactors: all systems must be tailored to the space and\nlow-gravity environment. Available space on-board\nis limited. Systems must allow for efficient work\nwith simple and safe operations. All materials must\ncomply with environmental requirements (outgas-\nsing) and prevent any injury to the astronauts. The\n\nsystems must comply with high safety and reliability\nstandards.\n\nFor long-duration missions a resupply infrastruc-\nture is required to provide the astronauts with an\natmosphere, food and clothing. Additional logistic\ntasks concern maintenance and repairs, including the\ndelivery of spare parts, consumables, fuel, payloads,\nand waste disposal.\n\nIn the following sections of this chapter three main\naspects of human space flight are discussed:\n\ne General aspects of humans in space\ne Environmental control and life support\ne Rendezvous and docking.\n\nThe first section provides a general description of\nin-orbit activities and discusses the preparatory activi-\nties required on the ground to accomplish these tasks\nin space.\n\nThe second section describes the systems which\nsupport humans in space. Environmental control and\nlife support includes all elements which enable the as-\ntronauts to work in a shirtsleeve environment, conve-\nnient for day-to-day presence. This function includes\nelements of atmospheric control and instrumentation,\nwhich prevent any danger to the astronauts, not least\nthe caution and warning system. The section describes\nall the functions, the general layout, the system design\nand the components of the system.\n\nThe third section discusses in-orbit rendezvous\nand docking. All leading space agencies have decided\nto retain launcher systems that are unable to place\nan entire space station in orbit with a single flight.

This section describes the team\u2019s\ncomposition and allocation of duties (5.1.1), and\nsummarizes its training (5.1.2) as well as the requisite\ninfrastructure (5.1.3). As is the case in aviation, this\nteam is frequently referred to as a crew, and the same\nthing will be done in this book since the term is now\nin common usage.\n\n5.1.1 The Crew of the International\nSpace Station\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) will, for the fore-\nseeable future, be the only permanently occupied sta-\ntion in space. ISS will therefore be used as the starting\npoint for describing the composition of the crew and\nthe tasks of its members. Daily life on-board a space\nvehicle and the methods of working together as a team\nwill also be illustrated using the ISS as an example.\n\n5.1.1.1 Composition and Selection of the Team\n\nThe crews of the ISS consisted of up to three members\nduring the station assembly period. After the loss of\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nthe Space Shuttle Columbia, the crew was even reduced\nto two astronauts. This was done to conserve resour-\nces, which could only be brought to the station by the\nProgress and Soyuz transporters. This remained the\nsituation during the period from February 2003 to\nJuly 2006. However, the size of the space station and\nthe multitude of servicing tasks require a minimum\ncrew of two astronauts just for ongoing maintenance.\nFor sustained work on the scientific experiments, the\nexperience of the last few years has shown that a crew\nof at least three astronauts is required.\n\nThe composition of each crew is negotiated by an\ninternational body, the Multilateral Crew Operation\nPanel (MCOP), made up of the partners participa-\nting in the space station, namely the USA, Russia,\nEurope (represented by ESA), the Canadian Space\nAgency (CSA) and Japan\u2019s Space Agency (JAXA).\nThis panel authorizes ISS training for the astronauts\nand nominates primary and backup crews. ISS crews\nare assigned to expeditions. These are core teams of\nat least two people who fly to and return from the\nstation together in the same space vehicle. Because\nof the reduced Space Shuttle flight plan, the expedi-\ntions continue to fly to the space station and back in\nthe Soyuz capsule. The composition of such crews is\ngoverned by the principle that the major partners, the\nUSA and Russia, are always represented by one crew\nmember, the reason being that they are responsible\n\nfor their respective station segments.\n\nWith the arrival of a significant contribution in the\nform of a pressurized module (USA, Russia, Europe,\nJapan) ora station tool like the Space Station Robotic\nManipulating System (SSRMS, a resource provided\nby Canada), the spirit of ISS partnership became a\nreality, and the station\u2019s resources are at the disposal\nof new partners in proportion to their contribution.\nThe same applies to crew time and the right to have\na partner\u2019s own astronauts join an expedition crew.\nPutting this right into practice is the responsibility\nof the MCOP.\n\nWith the arrival of the Columbus laboratory\nmodule Europe earned approximately 8.5% of the\nresource rights to use the US segment and can plan\non having its own (ESA) astronauts join expeditions.\nDepending on the planning, every two to three years\nESA astronauts will be sent to the ISS for the duration\nof an expedition.\n\n2/24/09 5:19:17 PM\n",

For the\ncrew on-board, this complexity means numerous\nspecial tasks which are identified in the so-called crew\nqualification and responsibilities matrix (CQRM)\n(Figure 5.1.1). In order to equip the crew with all\nthe required qualifications in the available training\ntime, compromises must be made as to the depth of\nknowledge communicated to each individual crew\nmember. This is an evolution of the customary con-\ncept for distributing tasks on-board the Space Shuttle.\nIn this vehicle the flight tasks' are assigned to the\n\n' The Space Shuttle is both an orbiting space vehicle and an air-\ncraft (during its propulsion-free return to Earth). Therefore,\nthe division of tasks in the cockpit is very similar to that in an\naircraft. This is also true of the seating positions for the com-\nmander (left) and the pilot (right). The position of the access\nhatch on the port (left) side is also analogous to aircraft.\n\nCHO5.indd 403\n\ncommander (CDR) and the pilot (PLT), with the\nsupport of mission specialists who are located on\nthe flight and mid decks. The minimum number\nneeded to perform all the tasks associated with the\ntechnical systems of the Space Shuttle is five. If the\nflight involves a complex payload, two to a maximum\nof three specialists are added. Their training is limited\nto the safe transport of and work associated with fe.\nscientific experiments and to technical testing. Of late,\nmission specialists have also been taking over these\npayload tasks and, accordingly, flights with payload\nspecialists have now stopped. Another group of Space\nShuttle crew members are astronauts with special\nresponsibilities, such as astronaut educators. These\nare astronauts whose main responsibility is in the\narea of out reach.\n\nIn the Russian system the Soyuz commander and\nthe Soyuz flight engineer (FE) handle all flight tasks.\nThe third seat in the narrow Soyuz capsule is occupied\neither by a \u201cspace flight participant\u201d or tourist, or by a\n\n2/24/09 5:19:17 PM\n",

Once on-board the\nISS, the Soyuz commander and the Soyuz flight engi-\nneer either become part of the new expedition crew\nor return to Earth with the short-term visitor. This\nwas the case for Soyuz replacement missions \u2014 the\nso-called \u201ctaxi flights.\u201d\n\nFor the space station crew two positions are defi-\nned: the station commander (ISS CDR) and the flight\nengineer (FE-1, FE-2). The authority of the ISS CDR is\ndescribed in the Space Station Code of Conduct\u201d and\nis legally binding for all designated ISS crew members\nfor the duration of their training and flight. In turn\nthe ISS CDR is responsible to the ISS flight director\nat Mission Control Centre in Houston for all aspects\nassociated with the safe and successful realization of\nthe mission. Although all partner control centers are\nbasically responsible for their own space station con-\ntribution, the special role of the ISS flight director is\nspecifically emphasized with respect to the ISS crew.\nThis is a reflection of the major contribution of the\nUSA to the ISS. Both positions, ISS commander and\nflight engineers, share the routine and special tasks\nthat are to be carried out during the expedition. (See\nthe example for a CQRM shown in Figure 5.1.1.)\n\nAll the tasks to be dealt with during an expedition\nare defined and negotiated long before the event and\nspecified in various documents.\u2019 The result is a collec-\ntion of major objectives for each expedition as well\nas different training requirements. If a crew member\nundergoes extensive training as a specialist for particu-\nlarly difficult repairs or overhauls, it must be guaran-\nteed at the same time that the necessary replacement\nparts for this repair will be sent to the space station\nin time for the work to be carried out.\n\n2 The ISS Crew Code of Conduct was negotiated in the\nMCOP and approved by all partner agencies. Besides the\nquestion of authority on-board, it regulates issues of liabi-\nlity, applicable law, legal jurisdiction back on Earth, ethical\naspects and the obligation of expedition members not to\nuse their position as an ISS crew member for personal\ngain.\n\n3 The most important documents are the Tactical Plan (TP)\nand the Increment Description and Requirements Docu-\nment (IDRD), which NASA negotiates with the partners for\neach increment (the duration of an expedition on-board\nthe space station). The priorities for complex tasks are\nsimilarly prescribed.\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nThe underlying concept of the ISS is that of a\nlaboratory providing all partners with free, unlimi-\nted access to the laboratory facilities, tools and crew\nin proportion to their contribution. In principle no\ndistinction is made for a planned experiment as to\nwhether it is carried out by a Japanese or a European\nastronaut in the Columbus module. In practice, howe-\nver, it turns out that, despite the mechanical coupling\nof the station segments, the station is clearly separated\ninto a Russian part and a part which is operated by the\nUSA and its partners Canada, Europe and Japan. The\nmaintenance of the Russian segment alone requires the\nentire crew time of at least one cosmonaut. The US as-\ntronauts are primarily trained for work, maintenance\nand the repair of the systems in the US orbital segment\nand accordingly are assigned these tasks. Despite such\nrestrictions the ISS is the biggest and most successful\ninternational civilian project ever realized.\n\n5.1.1.3 Daily Routine of the ISS Crew\n\nThe daily routine on-board the ISS is the result of\na long planning process. Parallel to crew training,\na catalog of tasks to be accomplished week by week\nduring the expedition is defined by the international\nplanning teams. When the crew is launched, this col-\nlection of tasks (called the On-Orbit Summary, OOS)\nis available along with a more detailed breakdown of\nthe individual tasks for each day of the following week.\nThe daily plan, which the crew members on-board\nalso see on their computers, is in final form up to\nfour or five days in advance, but can be modified in\nthe course of the various on-board activities. The final\nplan is sent to the station the evening before, after it\nhas been agreed by the planning groups. Changes that\noccur afterwards are discussed with the crew in daily\nplanning conferences. These planning conferences\ntake place each morning and evening and are fixed\npoints in the daily routine. Between waking up at\n06:00\u2018 and the planning conference two hours later,\n4 The entire crew follows a common schedule without work\nshifts. The clocks on-board the ISS are set to Greenwich\nMean Time (GMT), which also does not change during\nthe summer months. This is a compromise to make a joint\nplanning routine possible for the participating control\ncenters. Because of the 16 Earth rotations per day, day and\nnight on Earth naturally play no role on-board the ISS in\ngiving a subjective sense of time.\n\n2/24/09 5:19:18 PM\n",
    "426": "5.1 Humans in Space\n\nthe astronauts have free time during which they can\nacquaint themselves with the daily plan.\n\nAfter the 15 minute planning conference, in which\nall crew members and control centers participate,\nthe astronauts follow their individual time line until\na common meal at noon. The same is true of the\nafternoon up to the planning conference in the eve-\nning. During the morning and afternoon, two and a\nhalf hours of fitness training is also scheduled. This\nincludes the time necessary to change clothes and\nfor personal hygiene. After the day\u2019s work the crew\nhas time for an evening meal and to prepare for the\nfollowing day. Because of the many replacement parts,\nexperiments and consumables stored everywhere on-\nboard, it is advisable to collect in advance whatever is\ngoing to be needed for the following day. This is also\nthe time to answer emails, to make any notes that\nthere was no time for during the day, or to telephone\nfriends and family. The crew can make telephone\ncalls via a broadband communication channel to\nEarth via relay satellites. This is a huge improvement\ncompared to the era of the MIR space station, when\ncommunication was only possible during flights over\nSoviet ground stations. The working day is limited\nto a maximum of eight hours, including preparati-\non, follow-up and sport activities. An international\nteam of ISS crew surgeons monitors adherence to\nthis time schedule. Interruptions to sleep, due to\nsuch things as unavoidable work on experiments,\nmust be compensated with the equivalent free time.\nNevertheless, members of long-duration expeditions\nreported that they actually never felt off duty, which\nis understandable in view of the unusual workplace\nand challenging environment.\n\nExperience with the MIR space station has shown\nthat overworking the crew is a constant risk. There-\nfore, in contrast to short Space Shuttle flights with\nspacelab, there are no work shifts for the European\nColumbus module. While the crew sleeps, the ground\nstations take control of the station via telemetry and\ntelecommanding. Acoustic signals and warnings are\nsuppressed and problem solving is postponed to the\nnext morning wherever possible. On Saturdays, in\ngeneral, two hours at most is spent on technical and\nresearch work. Cleaning activities are also on the\nprogram. Sunday is a free day and the time is used for\nvideo conferences with family and friends.\n\nCHOS5.indd 405\n\n405\n\n5.1.1.4 The ISS Crew as a Working Unit\n\nTwo criteria were mentioned above for arriving at\ncomposition of an ISS expedition crew. The first\ndetermines which astronauts from the various part-\nner organizations participate in accordance to their\norganization\u2019s share in the ISS. The second criterion\nis that the crew as a whole must cover all the neces-\nsary qualifications as specified in the CQRM. Simply\nbringing experts together to form a team that has\nto subsequently dedicate itself in almost complete\nisolation to a set of tasks for a period of time does\nnot guarantee success. Much empirical information\nis available on comparable situations, such as teams\nwhich spend the winter at polar stations, teams of\nmountain climbers or, in general, expedition teams\nin remote areas of the world. Discussions about the\nright crew composition include all the usual criteria\nsuch as the optimal number,\u2019 whether the crew should\nbe mixed or of the same gender,\u2019 and hierarchy and\nseniority issues.\u2019 There is no reliable formula which\nguarantees a harmonious and successful crew com-\nposition. Nevertheless, there are a few characteristics\nwhich have supported especially successful ISS crews\nin their work.\n\nThe Astronaut Selection Process\n\nCurrent astronauts in the US, European and Japanese\nteams were not recruited specifically for long-term\nmissions on board the ISS, but for programs which\nwere relevant at the time of their recruitment. Exam-\nples are the Space Shuttle program with its brief flights\n(also with Spacelab), or the Columbus program with\nits emphasis on laboratory work, but also the later\n\n5 Because of the choice of the Soyuz capsule as a rescue\nvehicle and the capacity of the ISS, expedition crews of\nonly two, three or later six (which presupposes two docked\nSoyuz capsules) are conceivable.\n\n6 Several female astronauts who completed long-term expe-\nditions have in the meantime demonstrated that in view of\nthe work performed on-board, all the evidence supports\nhaving a mixed crew. However, intrusive attention from\nthe media is to be expected.\n\n7 It should be noted that the ISS serves to fulfill civilian\nscientific and technical objectives and normally manages\nquite well with a fairly shallow hierarchy. Only in emergen-\ncies and when responsibility has to be assumed for safety\non-board is a commanding presence definitely required.\n\n2/24/09 5:19:18 PM\n",
    "427": "CHO5.indd 406\n\n406\n\nabandoned Hermes space glider project. Only Rus-\nsia has not changed its recruitment criteria and the\ncomposition of its crews based on its experience with\nthe MIR station. The relatively new requirements for\nastronauts are symptomatic of the difficulties NASA\nhad in finding candidates for the expeditions on-\nboard the MIR station. Even today, the long training\nperiod for a flight to the ISS and the special tasks on-\nboard the ISS are far more demanding than what is\nrequired for a short mission. In addition, selection is\ntypically influenced more by national programs and\npriorities than by ability to work in an international\nenvironment.\n\nThe Cultural Component\nThe Russian-US collaboration on the MIR station\nshowed how important it is for the team to have a\ngood command of at least one common language. The\ndominant language on-board MIR was Russian. But\neven today, when English is the main language used on\nthe ISS, the team members are more in tune with each\nother if the Americans and Russians understand each\nother and each other\u2019s station-to-ground communica-\ntions. The solution to this is an intensive and lengthy\nlinguistic immersion in the other country before the\nflight. This can, however, conflict with the training\nregime and the wish to be with one\u2019s family.\nHowever, overcoming the language barrier is not\nenough. Handling the technology, the repair strategy,\non-board equipment storage and the scarce amounts\nof free time, which the control centers allow the crew\nmembers, are examples of different approaches taken by\nthe west and the east with respect to operating a space\nstation. Success depends on being extremely flexible\nwith regard to work methodologies, and recognizing\nand anticipating the different leadership styles of the\nvarious control centers. Training units on crew resource\nmanagement are a useful precautionary measure. They\nhelp to make evident the borders between a regulating\nhierarchy and personal judgment, which is similar to\nthe situation in an aircraft cockpit.\n\nThe Inner Factor\n\nDuring long-term missions the initial euphoric phase,\nwhich lasts about three to four weeks, is replaced by a\nroutine phase. This is characterized by repetitive work,\nsituations where an astronaut makes a mistake for the\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nfirst time, and especially by the monotony of daily\nroutine, which is governed by the constant necessity\nto stay physically fit and to adhere to a strict schedule.\nSensory and communicative limitations also play a role\nhere. This phase can be interrupted by external factors\nsuch as the arrival of a Progress/ATV transport vehicle\nor bya planned space walk. The ground control centers\nalso watch for signs of moodiness amongst crew mem-\nbers and take corrective action since these symptoms\nincrease the likelihood and frequency of operational\nerrors. Such moodiness disappears as the flight comes\nto an end and activities associated with packing up\nand documentation begin, which require a high level\nof concentration. At this stage positive anticipation of\nthe return to Earth dominates. Decisive for success,\nhowever, is the will of each individual member of a\nlong-term crew to regard every moment of the flight\nas a contributing factor to the overall success of the\nentire mission, and at the same time to regard this as\nan integral part of their freely chosen career. The ex-\npectation of some kind of reward after a flight has not\nproven to be a worthwhile incentive for dealing with\nthe sometimes unexpectedly frustrating monotony of\nthe tasks on-board compared to idealized expectations.\nSo the search for astronauts having the \u201cright stuff\u201d\nduring the early days of space flight has now become\na search for the \u201cright staff\u201d \u2014 for a crew which is tech-\nnically excellent but which also brings along sufficient\ninner motivation to ensure a cohesive team capable of\ncoping with the difficult phases of the flight.\n\n5.1.2 Astronaut Training\n\nBefore flying to space astronauts have to undergo an\nintensive training program lasting several years. Flight\npreparation and training take up more time than the\nactual flight itself.\n\nIn the course of international space flight coope-\nration, astronaut training takes place at the various\ntraining centers of the space agencies participating\nin the programs. For the ISS program, astronaut trai-\nning has evolved into a complex, global project with\ntraining centers located at Houston (USA), Star City\nnear Moscow (Russia), Tsukuba near Tokyo (Japan)\nand at ESA\u2019s European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in\nCologne, Germany.\n\n2/24/09 5:19:19 PM\n",

Training phases may vary depending on the\nflight duration (short-term versus long-duration\nmissions), the transport system (e.g., the Space Shuttle\nor Soyuz) and depending on the flight program and\ntask distribution (e.g., scientific objectives, pilot,\nboard engineer).\n\nThis section provides a detailed overview of the\nthree-stage astronaut training concept presently in\nplace for the ISS program (Figure 5.1.2).

The ISS partners nominate as-\n\ntronauts for these classes. These astronauts undergo\n\nthe advanced training program and can afterward be\n\nnominated for an ISS space flight mission. Advanced\n\ntraining lasts about a year and takes place at the five\n\ntraining centers of the ISS partners.

The training concentrates on generic\nand recurrent standard tasks and operations which are\nneeded during any mission to the ISS. Mission-specific\ncontent such as ISS assembly tasks, special repair ac-\ntivities, etc., are not part of advanced training. As for\nbasic training, advanced training concludes with the\nattainment of a set of qualification levels, which are\ndefined as a prerequisite for the next training phase\n(see also Section 5.1.2.3).

Based on the\n\ngeneric training content received during advanced\n\ntraining, the crew will be trained in this last training\n\nphase to conduct all flight-specific tasks which have\n\nbeen manifested for the flight. Generally the training\n\nprogram includes:\n\ne ISS assembly tasks like the docking, checking out\nand commissioning of new modules\n\ne Preplanned maintenance, upgrade and repair\ntasks (like filter exchanges, S/W upgrades or H/W\nreplacement or repairs)\n\ne Special preplanned EVAs or robotics activities\n\ne Flight-specific scientific and technology experi-\nments.\n\nTraining of complex operational tasks such as planned\nEVAs requires many hours. It comprises several repe-\ntitions of the whole EVA procedure to help the astro-\nnauts memorize the complex sequence of activities,\nto optimize the coordination and communication\nbetween the two space walkers, thus providing for\nmaximum efficiency and safety.\n\nToward the end of this training phase the training\nfocuses on potential off-nominal situations, including\nfailure analysis and recovery activities. In addition,\nthe astronauts participate in simulations of complex\non-orbit activities, thus applying everything they learn-\ned within a realistic operational scenario. Another\naspect is the simulation of ISS emergency situations\nsuch as on-board fire or rapid decompression. All\nthe on-board crew and the ground control teams are\ninvolved in these simulations to train for the required\nefficient and well-coordinated reactions in a complex\nand time-critical environment.\n\nAt the end of increment specific training, the\ntraining organizations sign a \u201cCertification of Flight\nReadiness\u201d (CoFR) confirming that the primary and\nthe backup crew successfully concluded the training\nand that \u2014 from a training perspective \u2014 they are\nprepared for and capable of conducting the flight\nprogram as planned.\n\nCHO5.indd 409\n\n409\n\nThe three phases of the astronaut training pro-\ngram as shown in Figure 5.1.2 present an ideal flow\nwhich is not always followed continuously.

Crews are regularly involved\nin emergency drills and undergo refresher training in\norder to maintain certain complex psycho-motor skills,\nsuch as those needed to operate the ISS robotic arm.\nAbout two weeks prior to the rendezvous and\ndocking of the ATV cargo vessel with the station, the\nastronauts on-board the station use an ATV on-board\nsimulator to exercise once again the monitoring tasks\nand appropriate reactions to off-nominal situations\nwhich may be required from the crew during the\nforthcoming rendezvous and docking maneuver. The\nresults of these simulations are downlinked to the ATV\ninstructors on the ground, who evaluate the training\nstatus of the crew. If needed, additional failure cases\ncan be added to a simulation to focus on the training\nof specific tasks or skills.\n\n5.1.2.2 Training Development\n\nTraining development depends on the availability\nof various products and facilities (e.g., operations\nconcepts, flight procedures, training simulators and\nmock-ups) which are delivered by various program\norganization units, based on requirements defined by\nthe training organization.\n\nTraining organizations are responsible for the\ndefinition, development and implementation of the\ntraining programs and training schedules, and for the\ndevelopment of the training courseware comprising\nthe training content, training tools and training materi-\nals (i.e., presentations, workbooks, manuals, computer-\nbased training programs, etc.). Selection, training and\n\n2/24/09 5:19:20 PM\n",
    "431": "CHO5.indd 410\n\n410\n\ncertification of training instructors are other important\nresponsibilities of the training organizations.\n\nAIlISS partners agreed on a common concept for\nthe development and implementation of training.\nInstructional system development (ISD) represents a\nvery well-structured method of training development\n(see Figure 5.1.3).\n\nAt first, an analysis of all tasks to be conducted\nby the astronauts is made identifying the knowledge,\nskills and attitudes required from the astronauts to\nperform their activities.\n\nDuring the design phase and based on the iden-\ntified tasks, training objectives are defined. Based on\ntheir prerequisite requirements, the training objectives\nare grouped into lessons and courses, thus establishing\na structured training flow. During this phase suitable\ntraining methods, required training tools and ma-\nterials, and appropriate training evaluation concepts\nare identified.\n\nOnly then does the courseware development pro-\ncess start. Every phase of the training development\nends with a formal review, so that the whole process is\nsubject to continuous evaluation and deficiencies can\nbe detected and corrected early in the development\nprocess. The training development concludes with a\nformal training readiness review (TRR) involving\nastronauts and training experts from all the ISS\npartners, who certify the lessons, training materials,\nfacilities and instructors prior to the start of the\nimplementation of the ISS program. The training\nimplementation also includes a formalized feedback\nprocess in which the astronauts undergoing the trai-\nning evaluate the quality of the instruction, training\nmaterials and facilities as well as subject matter exper-\ntise and the delivery skills of the instructors.\n\n. Development\n\nFigure 5.1.3: Training development phases according to instruc-\ntional system development.\n\n\\mpiementation\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nIn addition, crew debriefings are conducted after\nevery space flight in order to better link the training\nto the real operational needs as experienced by the\nastronauts during their mission.\n\n5.1.2.3 Crew Qualifications\n\nThe training for all ISS systems is divided into three\n\ndifferent qualification levels:\n\ne User Level: Astronauts are familiarized with the\nmajor systems and learn everything that is re-\nlevant for safety aspects and for daily on-board\nroutine.\n\ne Operator Level (includes the User Level): This\nentails training for nominal and frequent opera-\ntions as well as for off-nominal situations which\nrequire a rapid crew reaction.\n\ne Specialist Level (includes the Operator Level):\nThis covers training of infrequent nominal opera-\ntions and training of appropriate crew reaction to\noff-nominal situations and malfunctions.\n\nThe training flow for the Columbus System Training\n(Figure 5.1.4) illustrates the allocation of lessons and\ncourses within the three training qualification levels.\nThe User Level training comprises cross-system intro-\nductory lessons on design and topology, operational\nconcepts and monitoring and command capabilities\nas well as a system-specific course covering the re-\nlevant system knowledge and basic skills for all five\nColumbus systems (DMS: Data Management System,\nEPDS: Electrical Power Distribution System, TCS:\nThermal Control System, ECLSS: Environmental\nControl and Life Support System, COMMS: Commu-\nnications System). The Operator Level training deals\nwith caution and warning responses and Columbus\nvideo system operations. Specialist training is dedi-\ncated to infrequent nominal operations like checkout\nand reconfiguration tasks as well as the reaction to\nsystem off-nominals.\n\n5.1.2.4 Task-Oriented Astronaut Training\n\nThe minimum crew qualification levels and the main\nresponsibilities which have to be available on the ISS\nduring any time are predefined for every on-board\nsystem and spacecraft. For example, the Columbus\nsystems require a minimum of one specialist, one\noperator and one user in a three-person ISS crew.\n\n2/24/09 5:19:20 PM\n",

The\ntraining of every crew member is individually tailored\nto match the distribution of tasks and qualifications\nas defined in the CQRM (see Figure 5.1.1).\n\n5.1.2.5 Integrated ISS Training Plan\n\nIn order to achieve a high training efficiency, the ISS\npartners elaborate highly integrated ISS training plans,\nensuring an adequate sequencing of training activities\n\nCHOS5.indd 411\n\n4ll\n\nFigure 5.1.4: Columbus\nSystem Training (Source:\nESA).\n\nat the various partner sites and avoiding training\nredundancies and omissions.

Since ATV operation is supported by US and\nRussian systems, certain prerequisite training for ATV\noperations and rendezvous and docking is already\nconducted in the USA and Russia before the crew\nbegins its first block of ATV rendezvous and docking\ntraining at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne.\nSince ATV docks with the Russian service module,\n\n2/24/09 5:19:20 PM\n",

One of\ntheir key elements is the SmartBoard \u00ae. These full-size\n\n2/24/09 5:19:22 PM\n",
    "434": "5.1 Humans in Space\n\ntouch-sensitive back projections are fully integrated\ninto the training lessons and presentations. Each of\nthe different training phases also includes theoretical\nlessons which are conducted in the classrooms.\n\nThe following components of the general purpose\ntraining infrastructure constitute a fully integrated\nnetwork and are maintained centrally:\n\ne EAC Video Archive System (ViAS)\n\ne EAC Voice Communication System (VoCS)\ne EAC Backup System\n\ne EAC GPS Timing System.\n\nThe EAC Video Archive System is composed of\nthree main components. The video server unit, equip-\nped with a 5 Tbyte hard-disk array, allows the digital\nrecording of up to eight analog video signals. Simul-\ntaneously the video is streamed to the EAC LAN\nusing data rates up to 4 Mbit/s. This allows observers\nto monitor the content in full-screen resolution on\ntheir personal computers. The sources for the eight\nstreaming video channels and the corresponding audio\nchannels are switched using a 64 x 64 (input x output)\nstereo audio/video matrix. Another 32 x 32 audio/vi-\ndeo matrix is located in the training hall. This matrix\nallows preselection of the sources and destinations\nlocated in this area. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)\nsoftware is used to record all eight channels into a cir-\ncular buffer. The circular buffer allows approximately\n60 days of recording before it starts to overwrite. Users\nhave access to the recorded material via a Web browser\ninterface. It allows viewing of all recorded material as in\na video-on-demand system and provides the capability\nto generate MPEG2 clips from the recordings.\n\nThe EAC Voice Communication System is also\na COTS system which is mainly used by air traffic\ncontrollers and media producers (e.g., broadcasters).\nThis system handles up to 256 physical ports, which\ncan be connected either point to point or as member\nof a conference. The user interface is provided either\nby fixed installations or via wireless mobile terminals.\nThirty-two of the physical ports are connected to the\ncore matrix of the Columbus Control Centre. This\nconnection enables the ESA Ground Segment (GS) to\nhave voice conferences during a simulation similar to\nthe one used for real-time operations.\n\nThe EAC Backup System saves all the configu-\nrations of any computer-based training hardware at\n\nCHOS5.indd 413\n\n413\n\nEAC to a centralized storage device. This technology\nassures the quick recovery of any device in case of a\nmajor incident.\n\nThe EAC GPS Timing System is used as the re-\nference time base for all parts of the EAC training\ninfrastructure. Using this reference a logged event in\nthe training simulators, like the Columbus Trainer\nEurope (COL-TRE), can be correlated to an action\nmonitored in the video recording of the astronaut\ntraining session.\n\n5.1.3.2 Columbus System Training\n\nThe main components used for the Columbus system\ntraining are:\n\ne Columbus Mock-Up (COL-MU)\n\ne Columbus Trainer Europe (COL-TRE).\n\nThe COL-MU (Figure 5.1.6) is a high-fidelity copy of\n\nthe orbital Columbus module. Each of the interfaces\n\nto be handled by the astronauts is physically available\nwith the original \u201clook and feel.\u201d All manual tasks for\nactivation, deactivation, maintenance and replace-\nment of parts are trained in the COL-MU. To meet the\ntraining requirements, each of the components, like\nconnectors, filters, transport locks, etc., are available\nat least once in flight configuration.\n\nThe inner dimensions of the mechanical configu-\nration (MECO) are equivalent to the flight module.\n\nAll needed functional and data interfaces are available\n\nin the MECO. However, the concept of the COL-TRE\n\nis more complex (see Figure 5.1.8).\n\nThe core of the COL-TRE is a simulator consisting\nof the following components:\n\ne Vital layer (original hardware of the Columbus\nflight system computers, DIFA) including the\noriginal flight software\n\ne Simulation environment (functional models for\ntemperatures, resources, cooling loops, etc.)\n\ne Simulator control (control of the simulation,\n\nintroduction of failure cases)\ne Man\u2014machine interface (MMI) computer\ne Portable workstation (PWS)\ne Payload simulators.\n\nThe vital layer is identical to the Columbus flight\nhardware and processor core for the original flight\n\n2/24/09 5:19:23 PM\n",

The system com-\nmunicates with the MMI system and the PWS. An\nastronaut manages and operates the Columbus system\nusing the PWS as the main interface. The PWS laptop\n(Figure 5.1.9) runs the original on-board software\nwith a graphical user interface to control and manage\nall functions of the Columbus system.

The simulation environment\nalso contains software models for the environmental\ncontrol system and system resources like power, coo-\nling, gases and vacuum.\n\nThe COL-TRE generates the complete set of tele-\nmetry (TM) data (low- and medium-rate TM). An\nastronaut using the PWS can monitor nearly the\ncomplete TM. During so-called integrated simulations\nthe COL-TRE is connected via ESA IGS (Interconnec-\nting Ground Subnetwork) to the Columbus Control\nCentre in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.\n\n5.1.3.3 Payload Training\n\nThe Columbus science laboratory hosts four European\npayloads and one passive rack:\n\ne EPM European Physiological Module\n\ne EDR European Drawer Rack\n\ne Biolab Biological Laboratory\n\ne FSL Fluid Science Laboratory\n\ne ETC European Transport Carrier (passive).\n\nSimilar to the Columbus system training, the payload\ntraining concept foresees two different types of in-\nfrastructure for the different training purposes:\n\ne \u201cStand-alone\u201d payload trainer\n\ne Payload simulators.\n\nThe \u201cstand-alone\u201d payload trainers are located in\nseparate payload training booths. Comparable to\nthe COL-MU, the \u201cstand-alone\u201d trainers represent\na high-fidelity mock-up of the real flight hardware.\nDifferent from the Columbus system, the payload\nsystems have a higher number of MMIs (switches,\ndisplays, connectors, etc.).\n\nBut also at the payload trainers all MMIs are availa-\nble in high fidelity and their electrical and mechanical\nfunctions are identical to the MMIs used for the flight\nhardware. An instructor station is connected to each\nof the payload trainer racks to monitor the functions\nof the MMIs and to manipulate them for training pur-\nposes. A dedicated laptop serves as the main interface\nbetween the astronaut and the payload system. The\nlaptops can be connected either to the stand-alone\ntrainers or to the payload simulators and run a copy\nof the software used in the orbital systems.\n\nCHOS5.indd 415\n\n415\n\nThree payload simulators are integrated into the\nMECO of the COL-TRE. The simulators are software-\nbased models of the payloads. A touchscreen device\nwith back projection using a full Columbus 19-inch\ndouble rack provides the MMI between the user and\nthe simulator. The payloads are graphically displayed\nin full size. Switches and all other user interfaces can\nbe manipulated by using the touchscreen. The soft-\nware models are fully integrated into the COL-TRE\nand to the ESA ground segment. During simulations\nthe payload telemetry is forwarded via the COL-TRE\nto COL-CC or to the payload user centers, which are\ndistributed across Europe. Accordingly, telecommands\nissued by any authorized facility are forwarded via\nthe ESA ground station and COL-TRE to the payload\nsimulators.\n\nThe payload simulators are used to train the\nnominal operations of the payloads as well as off-\nnominal conditions of the Columbus system as it\nrelates to the connected payloads. The stand-alone\npayload trainers are mainly used to train manual tasks\nto be carried out by the astronauts, like activation,\ndeactivation, exchange of probes and maintenance\n(see, e.g. Figure 5.1.10).\n\nSimulations\n\nThe flight operations part of each space mission is\nhandled by the ground operation teams. Each of the\ninternational partners in the ISS program is responsi-\nble for mission control and operations of its facilities\nin orbit. The different partners are also responsible\n\nFigure 5.1.9: Portable workstation (Source: ESA).\n\n2/24/09 5:19:41 PM\n",

Besides the training of astronauts,\nEAC is also responsible for the training and certifica-\ntion of the ground controllers and support personnel.\nComparable to the astronaut training, the ground\npersonnel have to go through a multilevel training and\ncertification program. Only certified personnel are\nallowed to participate actively in mission operations\ntasks. An important part of the process is the parti-\ncipation in simulations. Three different simulations\nmodes are distinguished:\n\nStand-alone training und simulations\n\nIntegrated simulations\n\nJoint integrated simulations.\n\nThe Training, Qualification and Verification System\n(TQVS) in COL-CC is used for stand-alone simula-\ntions. This system is nearly identical to the COL-TRE\nwithout the MECO and the Crew MMI. Stand-alone\nsimulations are locally organized and managed at\nCOL-CC for the training of the COL-CC ground\ncontroller team.\n\nDuring integrated simulations the COL-TRE at\nEAC is used. The COL-TRE sends telemetry to the ESA\nground station and receives commands as in the case\nof the Colombus orbital facility. The ground control\nteams are able to monitor the low- and medium-rate\ntelemetry at their consoles and to uplink commands\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nto the COL-TRE. This system does not produce high\nrate scientific data streams. On special occasions like\nsystem verification tests, a stream of static high-rate\ndata is transmitted to the ESA ground station. Since the\nCOL-CC distributed Voice Communication System\n(VoCS) is used in every simulation for all voice com-\nmunications, the proper use of this system is an im-\nportant part of the training and certification process. If\nrequired by the simulation/training objectives, a crew\nmember or an appropriately trained crew member\nreplacement is located in the COL mock-up or COL-\nTRE to perform the procedures and activities planned\nfor the training session. This crew member will be\nmonitored by the Colombus video cameras, whose\nimages are linked to the ESA ground station. During\nall simulations, indications for the availability of\ncommunication links like acquisition of signal (AOS)\nand loss of signal (LOS) are simulated according to the\noriginal timeline of the simulated flight day.\n\nDuring joint integrated simulations the ESA\nground segment is connected to the NASA ground\nsegment using the IGS. The Colombus Trainer US\n(COL-TRU) located at the Johnson Space Center in\nHouston, Texas, generates appropriate data streams.\nThe COL-TRU is similar to the TQVS and COL-TRE\nbut without any payload simulator capabilities. The\nCOL-TRU is integrated into the NASA Space Station\nTraining Facility (SSTF) and delivers its data directly\nto this facility. The main purpose of joint integrated\nsimulations is to train all activities that need close\ncooperation between the different control centres,\nsuch as activation, deactivation and ISS emergency\ncases.\n\n5.1.3.4 Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)\nTraining\n\nEAC hosts three facilities for ATV training:\nThe ATV Mock-up (ATV-MU)\nThe ATV Storage Trainer\nThe ATV Crew Trainer (ACT).\n\nThe ATV Mock-up (Figure 5.1.11) consists of the ATV\n(pressurized module and propulsion module) and\nthe Russian service module (Svesta). Both facilities\nare built to original scale. All cargo-handling and\nstorage operations are trained in the ATV-MU or in\n\n2/24/09 5:19:50 PM\n\n\u00ae\n",

The module is equipped with a complete set of\ncargo containers, the so-called cargo bags. The crew is\ntrained in loading and unloading, fluid cargo handling\n(propulsion, gases, water) and emergency cases like\nfire and leakages. Only the ATV-relevant MMIs are\navailable within the Russian service module, mainly\nthe ATV crew workplace and the Russian communi-\ncation equipment. All non-ATV-relevant crew tasks\nand crew interfaces in the Russian part of the ISS are\ntrained in the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre\nlocated close to Moscow.\n\nThe ACT is a complex simulator for all rendezvous\nand docking maneuvers of the ATV. Regularly the ATV\napproaches, docks and undocks in fully automated\nmode. But the on-board crew and the ground support\ncrew in the ATV control centre in Toulouse, France,\ncarefully monitor those phases of the ATV flight.\n\nATV transmits relevant telemetry data comprising\nattitude and control system information, important\nsensor data and video from the on-board camera.\nThe crew is able to monitor the data and video at its\nATV crew workplace. The crew is also able to select\ndifferent telemetry parameters or different camera\nviews on the displays. If the crew or ground personnel\nrecognize that the vehicle is moving out of the limited\ncorridor, both will be able to command an escape\ntrajectory for the vehicle or even abort the complete\napproach maneuver.\n\nThe ATV crew workplace is installed in the Russian\nservice module and also in the ATV training booth. By\n\nCHOS5.indd 417\n\n417\n\nusing an exact dynamic functional model and the ori-\nginal flight software of ATV, the ACT is able to generate\nall the telemetry data and computer-generated images\nwhich correspond to the video information. This\nmakes the ACT and its MMIs an example of the use of\nvirtual reality technologies in astronaut training.\n\nIn addition to the ACT facility, a software version\nof the ATV simulation is installed on a workstation\nand on the crew\u2019s on-board computers. A 3D viewer\nallows the trainee to have an overview of the positions\nand maneuvers of the ISS and the ATV.\n\nSoyuz Trainer\n\nBesides the Space Shuttle, the Russian Soyuz is cur-\nrently the only available system providing crew trans-\nportation capabilities to the ISS. The main part of the\nSoyuz training is performed in Russia. The EAC Soyuz\ntrainer provides capabilities for refresher training for\nthe astronauts in case needed. The EAC Soyuz simula-\ntor is a software simulation. The crew MMIs comprise\none original set of Soyuz steering devices and a touch-\nsensitive display like that installed in the latest versi-\non of the Soyuz capsule. Additional monitors show\ngraphical simulations of the video images, the view\nthrough the Soyuz vehicle window, and a graphical\nsimulation of the panel including all switches etc.\n\nISS System Training\n\nThe Columbus module is connected to Node 2 of the\nUS segment of the ISS. All resources like power, coo-\nling, data communication, etc., are provided through\nthe interfaces between Columbus and Node 2. The\nmain crew interface within the US part of the station\nis a laptop known as the Portable Crew Station (PCS).\nThe American Segment Trainer (AST) is able to simu-\nlate the complete infrastructure including Windows\nserver architecture. Especially during the installation\nof the Columbus module on the station and during\nthe first activation, the crew uses the PCS as a main\ninterface. Furthermore, the AST includes the ISS\nInventory Management System (IMS), which is also\nused for the management of items delivered by ATV\nand used during the ATV cargo training.\n\nNeutral Buoyancy Facility (NBF)\nEurope\u2019s largest neutral buoyancy facility is located\nat EAC.

On Earth, the biosphere\nis the human life support system. Earth\u2019s biosphere\nis an almost closed system as to mass transfer, but\nan open system as far as energy exchange with space\nis concerned [5.2.2]. It is the task of a life support\nsystem to assure the biological autonomy of hu-\nmans in an isolated environment, while creating\n\n2/24/09 5:20:25 PM\n",

This includes\nattention to vibration and noise levels, protection\nfrom ionizing and nonionizing radiation, electro-\nmagnetism and gravity or the effects of microgra-\nvity. Thermal comfort, adequate air quality and safe\nhandling of all equipment in the habitat itself are\nlikewise critical.\n\nOf course, there are different understandings of\nwhich functions belong to a life support system. For\nthe Russians the life support system includes, for\nexample, the storage and preparation of food, refrige-\nrators and freezers, extravehicular activities, personal\nhygiene and housekeeping functions. For NASA these\nareas are covered under \u201ccrew systems.\u201d There are also\ndifferences in how individual subfunctions of the life\nsupport system are understood, a topic which will not\nbe addressed here.\n\nFigure 5.2.1 summarizes the classic functions of a\nlife support system and lists on the right related func-\ntions which do not typically belong to a life support\nsystem but which will also be discussed for the sake\nof completeness.\n\nThe following discussion describes the life sup-\nport system of the International Space System (ISS),\nas the only continuously occupied space habitat at\npresent. The individual functions can be applied to\nspace vehicles as well as lunar or Martian habitats,\nwhere, however, the technical realization can be very\ndifferent.

Each overpressure\nvalve consists of two valves connected in series. The\nouter valve is always open and can be either electri-\ncally or manually closed if the inner valve leaks or is\ndamaged.\n\nOf the four underpressure valves (negative pres-\nsure relief valves) on Columbus, two are installed on\nthe closed front end and the other two in the fresh air\nand return air duct, called the intermodular ventila-\ntion (IMV) ducts. The latter are exchanged for IMV\nvalves when Columbus docks with the ISS.\n\nThe underpressure valves are required should the\noutside pressure exceed the inside pressure by more\nthan 26 to 33 hPa, for example when Columbus is\ntransported from Bremen, Germany, to the Kennedy\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nSpace Center, Florida, or in case a Space Shuttle launch\nis aborted, followed by an emergency landing.\n\nThe underpressure valves function mechanically.\nIn order to avoid later leakage problems, a sealing cap\nis screwed on after the shuttle docks with the space\nstation.\n\nIn order to rapidly evacuate the module in case of\nfire, two redundant valves located in the external shell\ncan be opened electrically (cabin depress valves). The\noutside duct is heated to prevent ice formation when\nwarm, moist air is released.\n\nA pressure equalization valve is integrated in\nthe door to the neighboring ISS node. It is operated\nmanually in order to achieve pressure equalization\nafter docking and before opening the hatch. It can also\nbe used to extract air samples for analysis. The vent\nline dump assembly has the purpose of drawing off\nprocess gases from the experiments and releasing them\ninto space. Additional vent lines are needed to draw\noff the carbon dioxide which has been filtered out of\nthe internal air and the hydrogen which is generated\nduring electrolysis. The outlets of the vent lines have\nto be designed in a way that avoids their exerting any\nadditional impulse (plume impingement) on the space\nstation during the venting operation. In most cases the\nterminal nozzle is located far enough from the module\nshell to avoid deposition of waste gas residue on the\nshell.

All electrically operated valve pairs are\nsupplied and controlled by different electric circuits\nand control units for reasons of redundancy.\n\n5.2.1.4 Monitoring Air Composition\n\nThe air in the ISS has the same composition as on\nEarth, about 79% nitrogen (N,) and 21% oxygen\n(O,). The oxygen is inhaled by the astronauts and\neventually animals on-board and must be resupplied,\nsee also Section 5.2.1.6. Air can also escape because\nof leakage, reducing the total pressure in the station.\nOxygen is resupplied by water electrolysis; the amount\nis based on measurement of O, partial pressure. The\namount of nitrogen to be resupplied is determined\nby a measurement of total pressure. It is stored in a\ngaseous form in pressurized tanks.\n\nIn the Columbus module oxygen concentration is\nmeasured with an oxygen sensor located in the inco-\nming air duct. In addition, from each module on the\nUS side of the station there is a trace gas sample line to\nthe US laboratory (Figure 5.2.17 below shows a sche-\nmatic of all the ISS modules). There the air is analyzed\nwith a mass spectrometer (multiconstituent analyzer,\nMCA) as to the concentrations of nitrogen (N,),\noxygen (O,), hydrogen (H;), carbon dioxide (CO,),\nmethane (CH,) and water vapor (H,O). Measurement\n\n421\n\nof N, partial pressure immediately reveals any leakage\nin the outer shell.\n\n5.2.1.5 Ventilation and Air-conditioning\n\nSince there is no natural air convection under micro-\ngravity conditions, the air in a space station would be\nimmobile and the astronauts would breathe in most\nof the CO,-laden air which they had just exhaled.\nFor this reason, air-conditioning is not only a com-\nfortable convenience but absolutely vital, and the\nair circulation ventilator is accordingly redundantly\ndesigned, see Figure 5.2.3. The limiting factor for the\nextent of ventilation in the module is the thermal\ncomfort range for humans, which is primarily de-\ntermined by the air temperature and velocity, and the\nhumidity. The indoor climate requirements are listed\nin Table 5.2.2. The odd numbers for air temperature\nand velocity are a consequence of conversion from\nUS units to SI units.\n\nFigure 5.2.3 shows the ventilation concept for\nColumbus. Via the fresh air inlet (IMV supply air)\nthe air processed centrally in the US laboratory is\nsupplied to the module through the IMV incoming\nair ventilator. The 210 m*/h volume flow is designed to\nsupply three astronauts in the Columbus module. But\nin order to generate an air velocity that is high enough\nthere, the same volume must also be recirculated via\nthe air recirculating fan.\n\nCondensing\nheat exchanger\nFilter\nIMV supply air =\nope x g==9227=\ny; | ht |\n!

The dominant humidity\nsources on a space station come from astronauts,\nwho exhale moisture and perspire, and from moist\ncloth or laundry drying in the cabin air. In order not\nto exceed a maximum relative humidity of 75%, the\ncabin air has to be dried. This is accomplished by a\ncondensing heat exchanger which both cools and\ndries the air.\n\nThe upper limit for relative humidity is chosen\nso that no condensate can form on the inner surfaces\nof the outer shell. Damp substances and condensate\nwould lead to microbial growth and mold, which\nwas a major problem on the MIR space station. The\nlower relative humidity level of 25% was chosen to\nminimize the risk of electrostatic charge and subse-\nquent discharge sparking caused by air that is too dry,\nand to keep the mucous membranes of the astronauts\nfrom drying out.\n\nThe condensing heat exchanger on Columbus, see\nFigure 5.2.5, is an air\u2014-water heat exchanger and con-\nsists of two identical transfer blocks.

A temperature control valve\n(TCV) is nothing but an air flap which divides the\nincoming air stream, directing it to the two transfer\nblocks. Cooling water flows through only one of the\ntwo transfer blocks. If the need for cooling increases,\nthen the TCV directs more air through the cooled\nblock, and vice versa. The cabin air cannot be actively\nheated. The heat loads are usually sufficient to incre-\nase the air temperature.\n\nWhen moist air is cooled, water drops usually form\non the cold surfaces of a heat exchanger. Under micro-\ngravity they would be swept along by the air stream\nand return to the cabin via the air outlets, which could\nlead to short circuits in the electrical equipment. It\nis therefore critical that any condensate forming on\nthe heat exchanger be safely removed. The technology\napplied for Columbus is shown in Figure 5.2.5.\n\nThe air fins on which the droplets condense have\na biocidal, hydrophilic coating. Less than 1 rm thick,\nthis hydrophilic layer causes the water droplets to\nflow over the fin surface as a film. This liquid film is\nthen transported via the air stream to the end of the\nfin, where it is sucked between the capillary plates\ndue to capillary forces and drawn off through holes\nas a condensate\u2014air mixture with the help of the\ncondensate water separator assembly (CWSA).

During its 10-year\nlifetime it is slowly released to the condensate, thereby\nreliably preventing the growth of microorganisms. In\naddition, at intervals of three to four weeks the cooling\nis switched from one to the other heat transfer block.\nThis gives the moist block a chance to dry out, which\nalso hinders the growth of microorganisms.\n\nThe CWSA in Figure 5.2.3 is a centrifugal sepa-\nrator which conveys the condensate back to the US\nlaboratory for processing. Whereas the modules on\nthe US side of the ISS (US laboratory, Nodes 2 and 3,\nJEM, Columbus) all have their own condensing heat\nexchangers, the air in the Russian modules (FGB1,\nSM, MLM) is cooled and dried centrally in the service\nmodule (SM).\n\n5.2.1.6 Air Revitalization and Trace\nContaminant Removal\n\nProcessing air to be breathed, filtering and removing\ngaseous pollutants, monitoring the composition of the\nair, and emergency care in case a critical component\nfails are the functions of the atmosphere revitaliza-\ntion system.\n\n2/24/09 5:21:34 PM\n\n\u00ae\n",
    "445": "CHOS5.indd 424\n\n424\n\nFigure 5.2.6: The US carbon dioxide removal assembly (Source:\nHONEYWELL).\n\nCarbon Dioxide Removal\n\nAn astronaut exhales on average almost exactly 1 kg\nof carbon dioxide per day. This means that if six as-\ntronauts are on the ISS, then 6 kg per day, or 2190 kg\nof CO, per year, have to be filtered out of the cabin\nair and disposed of. This is the function of the carbon\ndioxide removal assembly (CDRA) in the US labo-\nratory and of VOSDUKH on the Russian side; see\nFigure 5.2.6. Both systems make use of the adsorption\ncapability of zeoliths to extract CO, from the air.\nEach system has two beds. While bed 1 adsorbs, bed\n2 desorbs, and vice versa. Before adsorption the cabin\nair has to be dried. Desorption is accomplished by\nheating and discarding the CO, into space.\n\nOn the European side, another technology is\nbeing developed in the closed loop air revitalization\nsystem (ARES). It is based on the capability of carbon\ndioxide to adsorption on the surface of ASTRINE\u2122,\na specially developed ion exchange resin. As in the\ncase of zeoliths, cycling takes place between at least\ntwo beds; that is, one bed is always in the adsorption\nphase while the other desorbs. The air does not have\nto be dried or processed in advance when using solid\namines because the bonding is only slightly influenced\n\nby humidity.\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nRegeneration of a bed saturated with CO, is\naccomplished with slightly overheated water va-\npor (105-110 \u00b0C). The water vapor flows over the\nASTRINE\u2122, acting somewhat like a piston which\npushes the desorbed CO, in front of it. The advantage\nof water vapor desorption is that it can take place at\nambient pressure (approx. 1 bar) and the desorbed\nCO, can be easily used to close the oxygen cycle (see\nthe section on oxygen reclamation below). Ifa vacuum\nis required for desorption, then the CO, is released\nto the outside and any chance for reutilization is lost,\nor additional devices like vacuum pumps and CO,\ncompressors are required for its reuse.\n\nOxygen Supply\n\nThe supply of breathing oxygen on the ISS is provided\nchiefly via water electrolysis. The primary backup\nsystem consists of a solid fuel oxygen generator\n(SFOG); there is a second backup system on the US\nside consisting of two pressurized oxygen tanks out-\nside of the US airlock.\n\nOxygen is also required for medical care and for\nthe emergency breathing masks, for which there are\nsupply connections in every module. The masks are\nworn in emergencies when pollutants are released,\nsuch as from fires. The oxygen from the pressurized\ntanks is primarily used to prepare the astronauts for\nextravehicular activities, see Section 5.2.1.9.\n\nIn water electrolysis, liquid H,O is broken down\ninto its molecular components, hydrogen H, and\noxygen O,, with the help of electricity:\n\n2H,O>2H, +0,\n\nWater electrolysis can be carried out using various\ntechnical processes, whereby there are three processes\nqualified for space applications. The Russian Space\nAgency (RSA) uses alkaline electrolysis with a po-\ntassium hydroxide solution and a circulation pump\nsystem, as was done on the MIR space station. NASA\nhas an electrolyzer [5.2.3] based on proton exchange\nmembrane (PEM) technology, while ESA uses fixed\nalkaline electrolysis (FAE) [5.2.4].

With the help of the Sabatier\nreaction most of both substances could be utilized,\nbecause the material loop could then be closed; see\nsection 5.2.2.\n\nFigure 5.2.8 shows the incorporation of the Saba-\ntier process in the life support system.

The water which is generated\ncan be used in the electrolyzer; there is no use for the\nmethane on the ISS so it is discarded into space. The\nconversion efficiency for the hydrogen is between 90\nand 100%, depending on the operating point. The\nreactor (Figure 5.2.9) is run under subpressure to\nprevent any hydrogen leakage into the cabin.\n\nMethane Pyrolysis\n\nIf one wants to avoid having to bring additional hy-\ndrogen on-board the space station, then only about\n58% of the carbon dioxide can be converted in the\nSabatier reactor using electrolysis and hydrogen;\nsee also Section 5.2.2. The oxygen and hydrogen\ncycles can be completely closed by adding a subse-\nquent step involving the pyrolysis of methane. The\nmethane is split into its components of carbon and\nhydrogen at high temperatures with the addition\n\nCHO5.indd 425\n\nof energy. This hydrogen is then fed into the Saba-\ntier reactor; the amount is adequate to convert the\nentire CO, flow. The entire process is illustrated in\nFigure 5.2.10.\n\nMonitoring and Removal of Particles and Gaseous\nPollutants\n\nBefore air enters the condensing heat exchanger, parti-\ncles are filtered out with the help of a high-efficiency\nparticle filter (HEPA, Class EU6).\n\nIn a closed habitat, humans emit gaseous pollu-\ntants (defined as gases other than O,, CO, and water\nvapor) to the ambient air; materials outgas; processes\n(cleaning, gluing, soldering, cooking, etc.) emit gases,\nas can leaks, for example from the cooling system.\nReaction products from the attitude control jets can\nbe transported into the module via the space suits as\na consequence of extravehicular activities.\n\nThe theoretical and actual pollutant cocktail on\na space station can be an exotic mixture. In the pro-\ncedure used on the ISS in the US On-Orbit Segment\n(USOS), shown in Figure 5.2.11, gaseous pollutants\nwith high molecular weights are adsorbed on ac-\ntivated charcoal. Contaminants with low molecular\nweight such as CO, CH,, H, and other hydrocarbons\nare combusted to water and carbon dioxide via a\nhigh-temperature catalytic converter. Since there\nis a risk that, for example, Freon refrigerant from\nthe Russian cooling cycle decomposes into toxic\nby-products because of the high temperatures in\nthe catalytic converter, a lithium hydroxide bed is\n\n2/24/09 5:21:43 PM\n",

The only difference is that the water\nfor drinking has mineral additives.\n\nWhereas the water on the Russian side is preser-\nved with silver oxide, the US side uses iodine. The\nwater networks on the Russian and US sides are not\nconnected and the water is supposed to be processed\nseparately. But because not all subsystems have been\ninstalled (on the US side, the toilet; on the Russian side,\nthe urine processing unit), and in order to be able to\nuse the US water on the Russian side for oxygen ge-\nneration, an exchange of water was necessary in 2004.\nHowever, mixing iodized water and silver oxide water\nled to the precipitation of silver iodide, which blocked\nthe pipeline. So a water treatment system had to be\ndeveloped afterwards to assure safe water transport.\n\nQuality Control of Water\n\nIn addition to the sensor system at the end of the water\nprocessing chain, the water quality is monitored by\nmeasuring conductivity and pH values and determi-\nning iodine or silver oxide concentrations.\n\n5.2.1.8 Fire Detection and Suppression\n\nIn order to rapidly detect a fire the modules of a\nspace station are subdivided into individual sections.\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nThey are usually in the form of systems or payload\n\nracks which are ventilated and separately supplied\n\nwith smoke sensors. There are also usually additional\n\nsmoke sensors in the modules themselves and in the\n\nventilation ducts. Besides the removal of heat from the\n\nracks, this assures rapid detection ofa fire. A fire alarm\n\ncan also be triggered manually. Fire alarms are indica-\n\nted by an acoustic warning and a visual indication of\n\nfire risk on an LED display. The alarm plan requires the\n\nastronauts to immediately put on breathing masks and\n\nlocate the source of the fire indicated on the display\n\npanel. The following measures are carried out either\n\nautomatically or manually:\n\ne Power is cut off from the affected rack to isolate\nthe fire and turn off its ventilation system.\n\ne Air exchange between the affected module and its\nneighbors is stopped.\n\ne Fire extinguishing measures are initiated.\n\ne The oxygen and nitrogen supplies are turned off.\n\ne The CO, removal unit is turned off.\n\ne The analysis units of the air quality control sys-\ntem are switched to standby status.\n\ne Anevacuation of the module is initiated (venting of\nthe cabin air into space); this can normally only be\ndone by the crew or the mission control center.\n\nIn the ISS each rack is a separate flammable seg-\nment: that is, the racks are separated from each\nother by bulkheads and fabric. Each rack has one\nor more small openings in which fire extinguisher\nnozzles can be inserted so that a rack fire can be\nquenched locally. The fire extinguishing chemical\non the ISS is carbon dioxide, stored in conventional\nfire extinguishers.\n\nAlso after a fire it should be possible to make a\nmodule habitable again. The CO, released from the\nfire extinguisher is extracted from the cabin air by\nthe CO, removal unit. If the module was evacuated\nto extinguish the fire or remove the gaseous pollut-\nants which were generated, there is the possibility to\npressurize it and make it habitable again.\n\n5.2.1.9 Extravehicular Activities\n\nHighlights of extravehicular activities are certainly the\nrepair and refueling of satellites in orbit, the retrieval\nof satellites for later repair on the ground, and of\ncourse the assembly of the ISS in space.\n\n2/24/09 5:22:09 PM\n",
    "452": "5.2 Life Support Systems\n\nThe Airlock\n\nFor activities outside a space station or orbiter, or ona\nplanet, space suits are essential. At an internal pressure\nof 1 bar the suit would be extremely bulky in space\nand movement not possible, so the internal pressure\nis only about 300 mbar. To adapt a human body and\ncirculatory system to this lowered air pressure, before\nexiting into space the astronauts have to spend a certa-\nin amount of time in an airlock in which the cabin air\npressure is reduced to a vacuum or to the atmospheric\npressure existing on the planet. The duration is such\nthat the body can adjust to the new environmental\nsituation. The airlock usually has two compartments,\none for equipment and the actual airlock. The space\nsuits are stored in the equipment compartment,\nwhere some physical exercises can be done, followed\nby donning or removing the space suit.\n\nIn the equipment compartment the astronauts put\non oxygen masks and begin to breathe pure oxygen. In\norder to activate their circulatory system, they spend\nabout 10 minutes on a stationary exercise bicycle. Over\na period of about 50 minutes the cabin pressure is redu-\nced from 100 to about 30 kPa. During this time nitrogen\nbegins to escape from the blood and leaves the body. At\nthis point the astronauts remove their breathing masks\nand put on their space suits. Hoses and cables supply\nthe suit and are used to reduce the internal pressure\nto about 30 mbar and supply it with pure oxygen. The\nlock is then evacuated to match the outside pressure\nand the extravehicular adventure can begin.\n\nThe Space Suit\n\nThe space suit, also called an extravehicular mobility\n\nunit (EMU), supplies the astronaut with everything\n\nrequired for life support and makes it possible for the\nastronaut to work in space (Figure 5.2.14). The EMU\nconsists of two subsystems: a life support system and\nthe space suit itself.\n\nThe life support system assures:\n\ne The supply of oxygen for breathing and pressure\nregulation of the space suit.\n\ne Thermal control in the suit through controlled\ncooling of the circulating water in the space suit\nenvelope.\n\ne Dehumidifying, and removing odors and gaseous\npollutants, including CO, removal from the cir-\nculating oxygen.\n\nCHO5.indd 431\n\n431\n\ne A communication link to and from the astro-\nnaut.\n\nFresh air, in this case pure oxygen, flows into the\nhelmet behind the astronaut\u2019s head, passes first over\nthe face and then down into the suit. Exhaled oxygen,\ncarbon dioxide and water vapor are carried along by\nthe flow, which is drawn off at the astronaut\u2019s elbows\nand feet and enters the mobile life support system for\nprocessing. This air first passes through an activated\ncarbon cartridge to remove gaseous pollutants and\nthen through a lithium hydroxide cartridge which\nremoves carbon dioxide. A downstream sublimator\ncools the air, removing moisture and separating it\nfrom the air stream by means of a slurper and a\nrotating water separator before routing it to a water\ntank. The oxygen flow is then measured and whatever\nhas been consumed is replaced from the oxygen tank.\nOxygen circulation is handled by a ventilator (volume\nflow about 10 m?/h).\n\n5.2.1.10 Thermal Control\n\nHeat generated by life support aggregates such as the\ncondensing heat exchanger, the electrolyzer, the CO,\nremoval system, and especially that generated by the\nusually water-cooled electronic equipment, has to be\neliminated by radiating it to space. Figure 5.2.15 shows\na thermal system using the ISS as an example.\n\nA distinction is made between two heat transfer\ncycles. There is a low-temperature (LT) bus with\nwater as the transfer medium, working at flow tem-\nperatures between 1 and 6 \u00b0C and primarily feeding\nthe condensing heat exchanger by which the air in\nthe module is cooled and dehumidified. The second\ncycle is the moderate-temperature (MT) bus, likewise\nusing water as a heat transfer medium, with a flow\ntemperature of about 18 \u00b0C and a maximum return\nflow temperature of 49 \u00b0C. At such temperatures the\npipes do not have to be protected against condensate\nforming on the pipe surfaces. Electronic equipment\nand other aggregates which are not harmed by these\ntemperatures are cooled with this water. On the ISS\na moderate-temperature heat exchanger is simply\nconnected in series downstream of a low-temperature\nheat exchanger; that is, the moderate-temperature\nheat exchanger receives as flow the warmed return\nflow from the low-temperature heat exchanger.\n\n2/24/09 5:22:11 PM\n",

Since there is no\nrefrigerator for cooling drinking water or food on the\nISS, it has to keep well also at temperatures between\n20 and 28 \u00b0C. The food has to be shaped to conserve\nas much space as possible to achieve high packing\ndensity in the storage lockers.\n\nAstronauts consume four meals a day. In consulta-\ntion with each individual astronaut, nutrition experts\nhave selected meals that assure that the body receives\nthe proper balance of calories, vitamins and miner-\nals. Caloric consumption varies by person and sex\nbetween 1900 and 3200 calories. The food consists of\nfruit, nuts, chicken, beef, seafood and sweets, among\nmany other things, and has usually been conserved\nby heating, dehydration or radiation.

When designing\na life support system it is the daily averages which\nare of interest. Measurements have confirmed the\nusefulness of the values employed in the design\nprocess.\n\nPer person and day an astronaut requires 0.85 kg\nof oxygen.

In the simplest case the oxygen is\ncarried in pressurized tanks, cryogenically, or in the\nform of oxygen cartridges and continuously fed into\nthe cabin.\n\nThe CO, is removed using lithium hydroxide\ncartridges, and the moisture released to the air by\nthe astronauts is collected with adsorbers like silica\ngels or a condensing heat exchanger. Typical of open\nsystems is that emitted substances like CO,, waste\nwater and urine are not recycled but disposed of.\nUrine is collected and burns up together with an\nunmanned supply vehicle when it reenters Earth\u2019s\natmosphere.\n\n5.2.2.3 Closed Life Support Systems\n\nA closed life support system means that waste pro-\nducts on a space station are reprocessed and reenter\nthe cycle.

Besides functioning\nperfectly, there are additional quality requirements like\nhigh durability, ease of maintenance and repair, safety,\ngood failure identification, and good man\u2014machine\ninterfaces. Systems must be developed for a service\nlife extending over the entire operational phase of\nthe mission (10 years for the ISS, for example) and\nwhich includes the construction phase (five years for\nthe ISS). In order to carry out maintenance and repair\nwork safely and with simple means, maximum surface\ntemperatures cannot be exceeded and requirements\nhave to be met for surface roughness, labeling, the na-\nture of knobs and handles, the design and installation\nof warning signs, etc.\n\nThe associated safety analyses distinguish among\nfailures which are life threatening for the astronauts\n(catastrophic), those which can lead to minor injuries\nor damage to nearby systems (critical) and those with\nnegligible consequences. For example, the failure of a\nload-bearing structure, the explosion of a pressurized\ncontainer, and possible contact with high-voltage or\nunhealthy substances are always ranked as catastro-\nphic. Motivated by safety considerations, it is accor-\ndingly specified in the technical design of systems that\npossible \u201ccritical failures\u201d be one-failure tolerant and\npossible \u201ccatastrophic failures\u201d be two-failure tolerant,\nin order to inhibit their occurrence.\n\n2/24/09 5:22:20 PM\n",

Face masks and fire extinguishers must be located\nat fixed distances throughout the station.\n\nThe particular design philosophy used to fulfill these\nrequirements may vary considerably. During con-\nstruction of the ISS it was the US approach to make\nsystems as redundant as possible (e.g., to have two\nidentical subsystems, one of which is in operation\nand the other only switched on if the first fails, or to\noperate two identical subsystems in parallel, but at\nreduced power). So in the ISS there are, for example,\ntwo CO, scrubbers, one located in the US laboratory\nmodule and one in Node 3. The Russian approach is\nto have a replacement system available based on a\ndifferent technological design to be used if a major\ncomponent fails. For example, if the CO, scrubber is\n\n2/24/09 5:22:21 PM\n",
    "458": "5.2 Life Support Systems\n\ndefective, lithium hydroxide cartridges are on hand\nfor CO, absorption; if the electrolyzer fails, oxygen\ncartridges are ignited to produce oxygen until a re-\nplacement unit can be provided. This design philo-\nsophy is viable because the ISS is regularly resupplied\nfrom Progress and Soyuz rockets. For lunar or Mars\nmissions another solution would be necessary.\n\nIn connection with a failure-tolerant design, the\nconcept of design to minimum risk is used. Liquids\nthat can seriously endanger health and thus represent\na \u201ccatastrophic\u201d threat for the astronauts have to be\nlocked away with a two-failure-tolerant approach.\nOne could also say that possible contact with this\nliquid by an astronaut must be hindered by two-failure\ntolerance. This might be realized, for example, by sto-\nring it in two nested containers. If one container fails,\nthe other could still prevent contact with the liquid.\nBut it is also possible to lock away the liquid in only\none container, making it so massive (designing it to\nminimum risk) that its failure according to the state\nof the art is not plausible.\n\nMost of the equipment in the life support system\nis zero-failure tolerant: that is, if the unit fails, then\nits function is not available (the failure of the electro-\nlyzer, for example, would lead to the end of oxygen\nproduction with this equipment). However, the design\nphilosophy would then specify either the operation of\na duplicate aggregate, or the availability of another unit\nthat can guarantee the performance of the function.\nExceptions confirm the rule here, too. For example, the\nfunctions of ventilation between modules, ventilation\nwithin a module, heat removal and monitoring the\nmodule atmosphere are all one-failure tolerant.\n\nThere are other differences in design philosophies\nregarding individual aggregates. For example, the US\nelectrolyzer is composed of several orbital replacement\nunits (ORUs). These are a number of interconnected\nindividual components regarded as one unit and\nreplaced as such in case of failure. In other words,\nNASA puts a priority on the reparability of equipment.\nAlthough the Russians also use water electrolysis for\noxygen generation, the Russian electrolyzer on the\nspace station is not designed to be repaired in orbit;\nit has to be replaced if it fails.\n\nNASA also pays attention to minimizing con-\nsumables and using regenerative technologies as much\nas possible, examples being condensate and urine\n\nCHO5.indd 437\n\n437\n\nprocessing for obtaining drinking water, and oxygen\ngeneration using electrolysis.\n\n5.2.3.2 ECLS System\n\nAs this handbook went to press, the ISS was still in the\nconstruction phase.

They were\nexpanded to include human-populated systems at\nthe Institute of Biophysics in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia,\nunder the leadership of Josef Gitelson in the BIOS\nProgram, and continued up to the BIOS-3 facility.\nTwo to three test subjects lived for up to six months in\nthis closed system [5.2.8]. The air was regenerated via\nphotosynthesis in a chlorella algae reactor and in up\nto three plant chambers (Phytotrons), which were also\nused to produce food. Protein food such as meat was,\nhowever, introduced into the system from outside. The\nfacility was able to recycle waste water and urine. Waste\nwas broken down via catalytic combustion and then\nadded to the biological cycle for reprocessing. Feces\nwere dried but not processed. The cycle was almost,\nbut not completely, closed (approx. 85%).\n\nThe only major human-populated facility for a\nclosed biological life support system is Biosphere-2\nin Arizona. It is based on a combination of different\nclimatic zones such as desert, mangrove forest, ocean,\nrainforest and the astronaut crew habitat, and is com-\nplemented and supported by an elaborate operations\ntechnology (\u201cTechnisphere\u201d).\n\nThis facility can supply up to eight test subjects\nwith air, food and water in a closed system [5.2.9].\n\n2/24/09 5:22:26 PM\n",
    "461": "CHO5.indd 440\n\n440\n\nAlthough there were some technical problems in the\ninitial phase and sometimes an inadequate supply of\nfood, Biosphere-2 is today the longest permanently\nfunctioning life support system.\nNASA has also intensively investigated this subject\nsince the mid-1980s. The focus is on:\ne Food production\ne Oxygen production via photosynthesis\ne Pollution removal using plants and symbiotic\nmicroorganisms\ne Recycling waste water and urine.\n\n5.2.4.3 Plant Experiments\n\nSince the beginning of space activities many plant\nexperiments have been undertaken to study selected\ncomponents and processes of biological life support\nsystems.\n\nA good overview of facilities, step-by-step tech-\nnical improvement and experimental results can be\nfound in Casado [5.2.7]. Relevant equipment on the\nfirst Russian space station, Salyut (1971), the MIR\nmissions, and the ISS up to 2006 is covered.\n\n5.2.4.4 Open Questions\n\nMost activities concentrate on the technical and pro-\ncess aspects of life support systems. The biological\nsystems are supported with relatively high technical\neffort (e.g., MELISSA, Figure 5.2.19). In most cases\ntheir operational stability and tolerance for malfunc-\ntions without external control is rather low.\n\nThere is less work published about other, operatio-\nnally related problems with the long-term performance\nof these systems. Typical examples are as follows.\n\nA: For long-term missions, reliable and operatio-\nnally robust performance is essential. This is normally\nachieved by using redundant or extremely depen-\ndable systems. It is theoretically possible to arrange\nredundancy for biological components or even entire\nsystems. The following questions arise:\n\n1. While system A is in operation and supplying the\ncrew, what is the nutrition source for the redun-\ndant system B in the meantime? The crew and the\nwaste products it produces have to be ruled out\nbecause, if the primary system A in use were to\nbecome contaminated, the redundant system B\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nwould also be influenced and no longer available\nas an optimal, contaminant-free system.\n\n2. But if the redundant system B is running at redu-\nced output, just to keep it operating, then how\nrapidly can its performance be ramped up to\nefficiently take over the recycling processes? Even\na simple biofilter for biological cleansing of used\nair requires several days to be activated. Aquariums\nneed several weeks of adjustment before their\ncondition is stabilized.\n\n3. How can a contaminated or collapsed biological\n\nsystem in orbit be cleaned or sterilized and then\n\nreconfigured?\n\n4. How can the biological starter cultures needed\n\nfor the purpose be safely stored in advance so that\n\nthey can become biologically active enough when\nrequired?\n\n5. How can the biological safety of the technical\n\nfacilities be reliably tested before they are put in\n\noperation? It is not sufficient merely to sterilize\nthe equipment. It has to be assured that it does\nnot emit any outgassing residue afterwards, that\nall materials are compatible with the sterilization\nprocess, and that the remains of dead biological\nmaterial such as cell walls are removed by bacteria.\n\nThese fever-generating sources are tailored to the\n\ncrew, so they can become very dangerous. Actu-\n\nally, one should strive for the absence of anything\ncausing fevers.\n\nB: During human long-term missions the accu-\nmulation of pollutants and metabolites in the rege-\nnerative environment is a matter of concern. Typical\nsubstances are outgassing products from the technical\nfacilities and equipment as well as metabolic degrada-\ntion products from the biological systems and from\nnature:\n\n1. For example, the plants themselves produce\nethylene. As a plant hormone it controls vari-\nous phases or effects of plant development such\nas growth, blossoming, fruit maturation and\ndeath. Many plants produce ethylene in order\nto approach or avoid walls (positive or negative\nthigmotropism). For other plants, ethylene works\nas a hormone which negatively influences growth\n[5.2.2]. Other plants require ethylene to initiate\nthe ripening of their fruit.\n\n2/24/09 5:22:27 PM\n",

It is also not enough\nto know its population dynamics.\n\nFrom an operational point of view the most impor-\ntant consideration is positively identifying the\nmost suitable methods of decontamination and\ncleaning before use, and verifying their effec-\ntiveness. After large-scale application of these\nmethods, their effectiveness must be verified by\nsuitable on-board analysis or diagnostics.\n\nFor effective decontamination it is not enough\nonly to kill or deactivate microbiological loads.\nEven segments of cell walls from dead biological\norganisms represent a high health risk for the\ncrew as pyrogens or endotoxins. In the meantime\nin vitro pyrogen tests have been developed to\ndetermine the objective sensitivity of individuals\nto such loads.\n\nAn open question is how to react when it is deter-\nmined that some of the crew are reacting negative-\nly to the environment and that there is a health\nrisk. Such problems cannot be eliminated before\nthe flight by testing, since sensitivity may arise\nonly in the course of the mission as pollutants\naccumulate.\n\nD: Another open question is the genetic stability\n\nof biological systems. Multigeneration experiments\nwith plants suggest that their biological fitness changes\nover time.

Since then, numerous\ndocking maneuvers have been performed and with the\ninstallation and operation of space stations (Russian,\nAmerican and today the International Space Station\nSS)) it has become increasingly a standard maneuver\nfor servicing vehicles. Accordingly, automatic systems\nhave been developed, implemented and successfully\npplied, in particular for unmanned servicing vehicles.\nThough well mastered and \u201cquasi-standard,\u201d the\nmaneuver remains risky and is safety critical, as can be\nseen by numerous small and sometimes large mishaps,\nlike the Progress/MIR accident in June 1997. Maybe\nthis is the reason why manually controlled docking\nis still the preferred method for servicing vehicles like\nthe American Space Transportation System (STS), the\nSpace Shuttle, when visiting the ISS. Moreover, there is\na backup system on the space station which can take\nover control of the approaching vehicle, and in the case\nof an unmanned vehicle at least prevent collision.\nThe existing systems are becoming obsolete (in\nparticular because old electronic components are\nno longer available); they have relatively high power\ndemands and they are heavy and expensive. This is\nwhy almost all large space agencies are working on new\nsystems or improvements to increase performance\nand reduce cost, mass and power consumption. The\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) has also developed a\nnew, fully automatic system based on GPS, lasers and\ncameras and implemented it in an automated transfer\nvehicle (ATV), the European servicing vehicle suppor-\nting the operation of the ISS. The first representative\nvehicle of the planned four ATVs is called Jules Verne\nand it performed a successful automatic docking\nmaneuver with the space station on April 3, 2008.\nMating in space is not only needed for space\nstation servicing but also a key technology for\n\n2\n\nCHO5.indd 443\n\n443\n\nin-orbit satellite repair (Hubble Space Telescope), the\nassembly of large space systems, as well as for Moon\nor Mars missions where samples are to be returned\nto Earth.\n\nThe physics of the relative motion of space vehicles\nin planetary orbits will be briefly described below and\nconcepts for the rendezvous and docking technology\nwill be outlined. In view of the first European success-\nful docking recently performed by Jules Verne with the\nISS, the focus will be on the ATV concept.\n\n5.3.2 The RVD Mission\n\nThe rendezvous typically comprises the steps (a) \u201cpha-\nsing,\u201d (b) \u201cfar-range approach, (c) \u201cfinal (or short-\nrange) approach\u201d and (d) \u201cdocking\u201d (or berthing, if no\nmating is performed). In the case of a mission to the\nspace station, the servicing is followed by (e) \u201csepara-\ntion and departure\u201d and finally (f) \u201cdeorbiting.\u201d\n\nThe primary objective of phasing is synchro-\nnization of the chaser orbit with the target orbit\n(anomaly, eccentricity, semi-major axis). This is achie-\nved by executing a number of orbit transfer maneuvers,\nthe execution errors of which are corrected by a\nnumber of small \u201ctrim\u201d maneuvers. Due to the rather\nlong time period between such maneuvers (mainly\nvelocity increments), they may be calculated on the\nground with the information then being uploaded\nby telecommand.\n\nWhen the desired conditions in terms of position\nand velocity are reached, the far-range approach\nstarts.\n\nThe transition point is not fixed but depends on\nthe accuracy and performance of the on-board ren-\ndezvous and docking (RVD) system (Figure 5.3.1).\nWithin this phase absolute guidance and navigation\nis usually replaced by relative guidance and naviga-\ntion.\n\nAt the end of the far-range approach the chasing\nvehicle is already in the vicinity of the target so\nthat additional requirements and constraints such\nas exclusion zones and approach corridors become\napplicable. Moreover, the needed accuracy no longer\npermits ground control but requires on-board con-\ntrol. For human systems this can be manual control\nor automatic control.\n\n2/24/09 5:22:36 PM\n",

The ISS is equipped\nwith two types of mechanisms, the Russian \u201cprobe\nand drogue\u201d and the American APDS (Androgenous\nPeripheral Docking System). For unmanned missions\nsuch as for a Mars sample return mission, there is no\nneed for pressurization and fluid transfer through the\ndocking port, thus resulting in a much simpler, lighter\nand cheaper mechanism.\n\nIn a rough approximation, separation and de-\nparture may be regarded as an inverse approach. De-\nparture from the space station must be within a well-\ndefined corridor in a well-defined time frame. Only\nafter sufficiently large distancing can the thrust- and\nfuel-demanding deorbitation maneuver be executed.\n\nBefore presenting some insight into the physics of\nrelative motion, commonalities and differences in the\nrendezvous approach of today\u2019s servicing vehicles for\nthe ISS will be briefly reviewed.\n\n5.3.2.1 Space Shuttle (USA)\n\nFor the US Space Transportation System phasing\nis controlled from the ground. It is completed after\n\narriving in the target orbit at a location about 74 km\nbehind the target. Here a thorough checkout of all sys-\ntems is performed. Thereafter clearance is given for a\nfurther approach to about 15 km, this time controlled\nby on-board systems. The subsequent phase depends\non the selected docking port at the station, which\ncan be either in the velocity direction (V-bar) or ina\ndirection toward the center of the Earth (R-bar). In\nthe case of V-bar, a point about 300 m in front of the\ndocking port is acquired. This is the starting point\nfor so-called \u201cV-bar hopping,\u201d an approach method\nwhich complies with the safety requirements (see\nalso Section 5.3.3). In the case of an R-bar docking,\na braking maneuver is performed at the point where\nthe trajectory crosses the prolonged R-bar axis and\nthen so-called \u201cR-bar hopping\u201d is started toward the\ndocking port (see Figure 5.3.2).\n\nIn both cases the cargo bay is oriented toward\nthe target docking port. Though the shuttle is able\nto perform automatic rendezvous and docking, the\nlast 100 m is usually manually controlled by the\npilot. This is supported by navigation aids such as a\nCOAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight, a passive op-\ntical instrument), CCTV (Closed Circuit Television\n\n2/24/09 5:22:37 PM\n",

Consequently,\nstrong thrusters are needed for the orbital maneuvers,\nparticularly during phasing and deorbiting. This is\nprovided by the orbit maneuvering system (OMS)\nwith its two 26 700 N thrusters. Smaller maneuvers as\nneeded for the proximity operations are performed\nby the activation of a combination of the 38 RCS\n(Reaction Control System) thrusters, each providing\n3870 N, and the six vernier engines with a thrust level\nof 110 N each.\n\nMission planning ensures that the final approach\nis always performed during daylight.\n\n5.3.2.2 Soyuz/Progress (Russia)\n\nIn contrast to the shuttle, the phasing of Soyuz and\nProgress is not performed in eccentric orbits but essen-\ntially in circular orbits. Arrival and departure of these\nphasing orbits are performed by ground-controlled\nHohmann maneuvers. Appropriate node corrections\nensure a coplanar orbit with the target at the end.\nThe far-range approach is performed automatically\nby the on-board systems and starts with a transfer\nmaneuver toward an aiming point on the target orbit\nabout 1.5 km in front of the target. For navigation the\nRF \u201cKurs\u201d system is applied, which provides relative\ndistance and velocity as well as the bearing angles.\nThe final approach is performed with the Sun\nshining from behind (30 to 60\u00b0) so that the docking\n\nCHOS5.indd 445\n\n445\n\nport is well illuminated. If the target is not Earth\npointing then the docking port generally is not par-\nallel to the flight direction. In this case a \u201cfly-around\u201d\nmaneuver is introduced to position Soyuz/Progress\nat a relative distance of 200 to 400 m opposite to the\ndocking port.\n\nThe successive final approach is automatically\ncontrolled and follows an imposed straight line toward\nthe docking port, ending with mechanical contact at\na relative velocity of 0.1 to 0.3 m/s.\n\nSoyuz, with a mass of about 7 t, is equipped with\na main engine of 3000 N, 14 thrusters of 130 N force\nfor position control (translational motion) and 12\nthrusters of 26 N each for attitude control.\n\n5.3.2.3 ATV (Europe)\n\nWith the ATV, Europe is providing an important\ncontribution to the servicing of the ISS. The maiden\nflight with high-precision automatic docking at the\nRussian docking port (V-bar) was performed on\nApril 3, 2008.\n\nAs for the other RVD systems, phasing is con-\ntrolled from the ground. The orbit and maneuver\ncalculations are supported by GPS measurements\nwhich the ATV sends to ground. At the end of this\nphase ATV is in a circular orbit about 6 km below the\nISS\u2019s altitude and drifting towards the station (see S_1)\nin Figure 5.3.1). The far-range approach starts when\nthe communication link with the ISS (local link) is\nestablished and stable. Via this link ATV receives GPS\nmeasurements from the ISS which allow high precisi-\non determination of the relative position and velocity\nneeded for the on-board calculation and automatic\nexecution of the maneuvers to reach aiming point S,,\non the target orbit, about 3.5 km behind the station.\n\nThis point is left only when permission is given\nfrom the space station. After receiving the go-ahead\ncommand, the closing phase is started and the relative\ndistance is reduced to about 300 m when reaching\naiming point S,. Again, a go-ahead command is nee-\nded to proceed with the final approach by means of\nforced motion in a straight line toward the docking\nport. When in close vicinity, an optical RVD camera\nis used as the primary navigation sensor.\n\nThe orbital maneuvers are performed with the\nfour main engines of 490 N each, while the smaller\n\n2/24/09 5:22:38 PM\n",

In this section,\nonly a short synthesis of the equations of motion and\ntheir impact on the selection of approach strategies\nwill be given. The latter are driven by safety require-\nments, mainly collision avoidance, which needs to be\nensured even in cases of loss of vehicle control.\n\nWhen using a reference system with its origin in\nthe target\u2019s center of mass (Figure 5.3.3), the relative\nmotion in a circular orbit can be described by a set\nof simple linear differential equations known as\nthe Euler\u2014Hill (sometimes also called Clohessy and\nWiltshire) equations:\n\nF,\nX= ~+4202\nm\nj= Dory w= 2% (5.3.1)\nm Torbit ~\nz= fe \u20142wx +30\u00b0z\nm\n\nwhere To,,it is the time needed by the target for one\norbital revolution, m is the mass of the chaser vehicle,\nand F, are the components of the sum of the forces\n\nLOW EARTH orbit\n\nYLoF\n\nFigure 5.3.3: Earth-pointing coordinate system (rotating; LOF,\nLocal Orbital Frame).\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nacting on the chaser (external perturbations like air\ndrag and forces generated by the thrusters).\n\nLooking at these equations we can see immediately\nthat the motion is decoupled into an in-plane motion\n(x-z) and an out-of-plane motion (y).

Though in the short\nterm the chaser is approaching, the motion is reversed\nat about \u2014100 m and in the long term (average per\nv_ orbit) the distance is increased. This is because v. is\nnegative. If the second maneuver A Vz, is not applied or\nonly partially applied, then we are on a collision-free\ntrajectory. If the maneuver is correctly executed we are\nona hold point at a closer distance to the target; that\nis, we performed an approach on a safe trajectory.\n\nA sequence of such maneuvers is called V-bar\nhopping, as above. It should be noted here that the\ndistance between the individual hops can be varied:\nthey may become smaller, the closer we are to the\ntarget.\n\nThe same principle may be applied for the radial\nmotion. Let us assume we are at point 2 (\u2014300/\u2014160).\nWe arrive at point 1 (\u2014300/+100) along the blue tra-\njectory when imposing a velocity increment in the\nnegative \u201cx\u201d (\u20140.33 m/s) and positive \u201cz\u201d (0.1 m/s) di-\nrections.

Accordingly a sequence\nof such maneuvers is called R-bar hopping.\n\nBoth strategies can be applied by the Space Shuttle\nwhen servicing the ISS (see also Figure 5.3.2).\n\nIf the acceleration during a maneuver is high en-\nough, then the changes in velocity can be performed\nwithin a short time period and considered as appro-\n\nximately instantaneous.

For con-\ntrolling the out-of-plane motion the same principle\ncan be applied.\n\nThe desired velocity increments are realized by\nappropriate commands to the thrusters.

The air\ndensity (the order of magnitude is p= 107'' kg/m?\nat 400 km altitude) not only is a function of altitude\nbut varies according to the solar activity (F10.7)\nand the geomagnetic index.

For the relative motion the difference in air\ndrag between target and chaser needs to be computed.\nA typical impact over several orbital revolutions is\nshown in Figure 5.3.7 for an ATV (chaser) and ISS\n(target) configuration. It can be seen that the initial\nnegative drift (away from the ISS) is reversed after\nthree revolutions to a positive drift (approaching the\nISS), thus becoming a potential safety issue.\n\nCHO5.indd 449\n\n449\n\n150\n-3000 -2500 -2000 -1500 -1000 -500 0 500 1000 1500 2000\n\nFigure 5.3.7: Free drift trajectory with (blue) and without (red)\nair drag.\n\nTo a first-order approximation the air drag is\nconstant over one orbital revolution.

For safety monitoring it is therefore\nrequired that the visiting vehicle be on a well-known\n(and well-predictable) position or trajectory 90 min\n(about one orbital revolution) prior to arrival at\nthe edge of the AE. The point at which the entran-\nce to the AE is initiated is called the AI (Approach\nInitiation).\n\nBefore the AI is triggered, the vehicle status has\nto be such that any free drifting trajectories resul-\nting from a potential loss of control of the vehicle\n(including 36 uncertainties) stay outside the AE for\nat least 24 h.\n\nWithin the keep out sphere (KOS) the vehicle is\nonly allowed to move within a cone of 10\u00b0 with respect\nto the desired docking port.\n\nOn the request of the ISS, the vehicle must be ca-\npable of aborting the approach and withdrawing to a\nsafe hold point. After this, up to 34 h (one day + one\nISS crew shift) needs to be bridged before permission\nfor a new approach can be expected. The total dura-\ntion of the maneuver within the AE may not exceed\n10 h, corresponding to one crew shift.\n\nWhen departing from the station a monotonic\nincreasing of the distance is required. The edge of the\nAE has to be reached after 90 min at the latest and\nreentrance thereafter is not allowed.\n\nThe vehicle must be able to recognize an impen-\nding collision and automatically trigger a collision\navoidance maneuver (CAM). By this maneuver it\nmust be ensured that the vehicle stays out of the AE\nfor at least 24 hours. Should the CAM be executed\noutside the KOS, then it is not allowed to enter this\nsphere.\n\nApart from these operational and mission require-\nments, there are a number of design requirements to\nensure ISS safety, an important one being the required\ntwo-failure tolerance with respect to collision. This\nmeans that any two independent failures within the\nsystem or its control unit should not result in a colli-\nsion risk, or, in other words, after any two failures the\nsystem must be able to execute a CAM.\n\nFor monitoring and communicating with the visi-\nting vehicle the space station provides a bidirectional\nlink, a so-called \u201cproximity link.\u201d\n\nFigure 5.3.9 shows the communication zone when\napproaching the Russian docking port at the V-bar\nside. This link is used for continuous transfer of data\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\nshowing the system\u2019s health state of the approaching\nvehicle.\n\n5.3.5 The ATV RVD System\n\nBased on the fundamentals described above, the\nATV approach strategy is easily understood (see,\ne.g., Figure 5.3.10). The AI point corresponds to S,\nin Figure 5.3.11. The nominal coordinates have been\nselected such that it is about 100 m above the target\norbit. Though this increases fuel consumption for\nstation keeping, it improves passive safety because\nit ensures a negative drift (away from the ISS) if the\nsystem control fails. The transition from S, to S, is\ncalled \u201choming\u201d and corresponds to two impulsive\nHohmann transfers with two intermediate correction\nmaneuvers. The latter are needed because of errors in\nboth measurements and navigation as well as in the\nexecution of the maneuvers. The required velocity\nincrements for all maneuvers can be computed accor-\nding to the formulas given above.\n\nWhen clearance is given for the rendezvous, the\n\u201cclosing\u201d from S, to S; is performed by applying a\nV-bar hop. As for homing, the transfer includes two\ncorrection maneuvers and aims at a hold point outside\nthe KOS in front of the approach cone. It is worth\nmentioning that by selecting a transfer duration of\nless than half an orbital revolution, a trajectory is estab-\nlished which follows the passive safety concept; that\nis, in case of loss of control the free flight trajectory\nwill have an average drift away from the station. Like\nS,, hold point S; represents a time-flexible element in\noverall mission planning.\n\nFor the further approach the ATV must stay with-\nin the 10\u00b0 cone zone extending from the docking\nport (approach corridor). This essentially prohibits\nthe application of orbital arc maneuvers (hopping).\nConsequently, the final approach is performed by im-\nposing closed-loop-controlled direct motion (straight\nline) toward the docking port.\n\nThe approach velocity follows a profile as given\nin Figure 5.3.12. It gets smaller as the distance to the\ndocking port closes. The linear decrease with distance\nis again determined from safety considerations. It\nensures that the bulge of a potential free drift trajec-\ntory (see also Figure 5.3.6) will not hit the structure\n\n2/24/09 5:22:49 PM\n",

Orbit transfer maneuvers\nof up to 75 m/s require burn durations of more than\n30 min resulting in a fuel consumption of about\n500 kg (Igp = 311).\n\nThe eight tanks (2 x 4) allow the stowage of up to\n6960 kg of fuel, more than half (4 t) being foreseen to\nboost the space station. These maneuvers are needed\nto compensate for the air drag effect, which results\nin a small but continuous deceleration, invoking a\nsmall but continuous decrease in altitude. The two\nhelium tanks with an initial pressure of 310 bar act as\na pressure reservoir which allows the operational tank\npressure to be kept at a constant value of 18 bar, which\nis needed to ensure a constant thrust level.\n\n2/24/09 5:23:05 PM\n",

They are controlled by\n\u2018our propulsion drive electronic (PDE) units such that\nafter any failure, fully six degrees of freedom control\ncapability is guaranteed, and after any two failures a\nCAM braking maneuver is possible. For the latter at\neast four thrusters are required along the x-axis. This\nis why each PDE provides dedicated drive electronics\nor two thrusters out of the eight which can be used\n\u2018or a CAM.\n\nTo achieve the required accuracy in control, in\nparticular during docking, the thruster must be able\nto execute very small impulses. The minimal duration\nor the 220 N attitude control thrusters is 25 ms. In\nthis operational mode the specific impulse (nominally\n286 s) decreases significantly (about 180 s), thus in-\ncreasing the relative fuel consumption.\n\n5.3.5.2 Guidance and Control\n\nThe guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system\naboard the ATV determines the dynamic state (posi-\ntion, velocity, attitude and attitude rate) of the ATV,\ncomputes the trajectory along which the vehicle is to\nmove, generates the set points for the attitude to be\nestablished, and ensures that deviations due to dis-\nturbances and perturbations are counteracted. The\nbasic principles of guidance are described in Section\n5.3.3. In close proximity the trajectories are compo-\nsed of segments following simple laws like constant\nacceleration, constant velocity or linear variation\nof the velocity as a function of distance (see also\nFigure 5.3.12).\n\nFour solar arrays are available for power genera-\ntion. Since they can be rotated only around one axis,\nthe ATV needs to establish a certain attitude to allow\nthe solar array area vector to point directly toward\nthe Sun (best efficiency for power generation). The\nattitude allowing this while keeping one axis pointing\nto Earth is called \u201cyaw steering.\u201d Figure 5.3.16 shows\nthe principle. The ATV rotates around the z-axis\n(pointing towards Earth) such that a second rotation\ncan be performed by the solar arrays, allowing Sun\npointing of the latter.\n\nCHOS5.indd 455\n\n455\n\nSun\n\nFigure 5.3.16: Yaw steering.\n\nFor small solar elevation angles f (this angle\nbetween the orbital plane and the Sun is a function\nof season), high angular rates would be requested\naround z. Therefore this concept is applied only for\nB> 10\u00b0.\n\nThe state estimation within the navigation function\napplies Kalman filter techniques for the optimal deter-\nmination of position, velocity, attitude and attitude\nrate, both absolute and relative. With the exception of\nthe last meter, translational and rotational motions\nare decoupled.\n\nThe attitude estimation is based on four gyros,\neach of which provides a two degrees of freedom\nmeasurement. Since gyros are affected by a drift\neffect, the estimation is regularly updated by means\nof star sensor measurements. To avoid singularities\n(also known as gimbal lock) the attitude kinematics\nare formulated in terms of quaternions (see [5.3.6]).\nAs for classical satellites, an emergency or \u201csurvival\u201d\nmode is defined, the major objective being to ensure\nsufficient power generation and provide a communi-\ncation link with the mission control center. To support\nthis mode, the MSU has access to two dedicated Sun\nsensors.\n\nFor position estimation, two nine-channel GPS\nreceivers are available, and for monitoring the ma-\nneuvers three two-axis accelerometers.\n\nWhen the local link is established, the GPS\nmeasurements from the receiver of the ISS are\navailable within the GNC of the ATV.

But in the close vicinity of the ISS even\nthis accuracy is not good enough. Moreover, RF re-\nflections from the ISS may disturb the measurements\n(multipath effects). Therefore, for distances smaller\nthan about 200 m a video camera is used for relative\nposition and bearing angle measurements. During\nthe last part of the approach (< 40 m) relative at-\ntitude measurements can be derived by evaluating\nthe image of the target pattern mounted close to the\ndocking port.\n\nFor independent monitoring of this system two\nlaser-based telegoniometers are available. Like the\ncamera, these sensors provide range and bearing angle\nmeasurements.\n\nThe attitude control is performed fully auto-\nnomously. The required torques are provided by short\nimpulses of the attitude control thrusters. To reduce\nfuel consumption during the long-lasting drift phases,\na specific control mode is activated which allows one\nthruster only to fire within a control cycle.\n\nDuring the mission, large transfer maneuvers\nand small correction maneuvers are distinguished.\nThe first are performed with the four main engines\nof the orbital control system. They require a proper\nalignment of the ATV to obtain the desired thrust\ndirection; generally an appropriate slewing maneuver\nis required before and after. The smaller correction\nmaneuvers can be performed with attitude cont-\nrol thrusters. Their configuration allows thrust to\nbe generated in all three axes so that appropriate\nthruster commanding gives a thrust vector in any\ndirection, thus avoiding the need for a dedicated\nslew maneuver.\n\nThe control of the 28 ACTs is not trivial. The GNC\ncomputes from the deviation between the set point\nand the actual state a continuously varying request\nof forces (from position control) and torques (from\nattitude control). This force-torque vector needs\nto be translated into appropriate commanding of\nthe thrusters. This is done within the thruster ma-\nnagement function (TMF). Since the thrusters are\neither on or off, neither the force nor the torque is\nused but rather the impulse. The maximum impulse\ncorresponds to the thrust level times the control cycle\n\n5 Aspects of Human Space Flight\n\ntime of the discrete controller. Modulating the time\ngives a quasi-linear variation of the impulse. To save\nfuel the number of thrusters involved to realize the\nrequired impulse is minimized; that is, there is a linear\noptimization problem, as given below:\n\nfix fre fae F,\nfiy fry fay uy f,\ntix by tnx : T,\nhy ty wm thy Uy T,\nhe tb, te T,\n\nwith |u;|<1and 0 <a <1\n\nor\n\nA-u=a-C,\nIt can be solved by the well-known simplex algorithm\n(see [5.3.8]). The u; components give the percentage\ntime of the control cycle needed to realize the reques-\nted impulse. Multiplying this by the control sample\ntime gives the command to be issued to the thrusters\n(more precisely, to the PDE units).\n\nThis approach is rather flexible, particularly in\nview of configuration changes as a function of mission\nsuccess or failure. However, due to the iterative search\nfor an optimum solution, convergence within a pre-\ndefined number of iterations cannot be guaranteed;\nthat is, deterministic behavior with respect to time as\nneeded for a real-time system is not ensured. On the\nother hand, simple termination of the optimization\nprocess after a predefined number of cycles does not\nguarantee an acceptable solution.\n\nAn alternative to this optimal approach is a sub-\noptimal approach. In this concept a fixed allocation\nof thrusters to a well-defined force-torque impulse\nis stored in terms of tables. Since these tables are\nvalid only for a fixed set of thrusters, they need to\nbe defined for each possible configuration, that is\neach failure case triggers the need for a new table. In\naddition the solution is suboptimal and less accurate.\nNevertheless, the differences are small and it provides\ndeterministic behavior; therefore it was the preferred\nsolution for the ATV.\n\n2/24/09 5:23:11 PM\n",

As a consequence, simulation\nby appropriate simulators [5.3.4] is needed for the\nverification process. The driving element is the cor-\nrect mathematical modeling of the environment and\nall perturbation effects on the equations of motion,\nincluding disturbances from the vehicle system itself\n(e.g., fuel sloshing, flexible appendices). Also the sti-\nmuli of sensors (e.g., stimulation of star sensors with a\nstar pattern, or the stimulation of a GPS receiver with\nan appropriate RF signal) need to be simulated.\n\nThe orbital mechanics including perturbations\nlike air drag, nonspherical gravitational field, Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field, solar activity, influence of the ionos-\nphere on RF signals, etc., are well known. Flexible\nappendices and fuel sloshing can also be modeled with\nhigh accuracy. Compromises, however, have to made\nwith respect to model complexity and fidelity (i.e.,\nthe model has to be simplified to obtain reasonable\ncomputation times for real-time testing, or simply\nto reduce cost). In the development phase the effort\nand cost of the implementation and verification of\nthe test environment are quite significant and may\nwell exceed the cost for the development of the item\nto be tested.

Due to the high related\ncosts, a demonstration flight of the ATV was not\nplanned, but a number of specific tests were embed-\nded in the first ATV (Jules Verne) mission to increase\nconfidence in mission success. This included the\nexecution of a CAM maneuver well away from the\nstation, a mission interruption (within the KOS), and\na retreat to S;, where an appropriate escape maneuver\nwas commanded from the ground followed by the\ninitiation of a new sequence of phasing, proximity\noperations and a new rendezvous approach.

Public interest in a mission \u2014 which shows the\nfascination of space flight \u2014 is especially high during\nthis early phase and at critical moments of a mission.\nThen mission operations are in full focus and often\ndetermine mission success or failure.\n\nThe objective to explore new, unknown paths con-\nstantly encourages new ideas from scientists, engineers\nand technicians. Therefore, no one mission is the\nsame as another. Suspense will always be immanent\nin future missions even though it is the ultimate goal\nof mission preparation to define detailed mission sce-\nnarios and eliminate flaws early before liftoff. For this\nreason the preparation of a mission is initiated many\nyears in advance of the spacecraft launch, depending\non the complexity of the mission.\n\nA significant part of the operations of the space\nsegment is conducted from the ground. Thus the\ncorrelation between hardware, software and involved\npersonnel is nowhere more visible than in mission\noperations. It is here where the operations infrastruc-\nture, which comprises numerous antennas, computer\nsystems, communication links and control rooms, is\ndefined and subsequently designed, and the ground\noperations system developed and integrated. Parti-\ncularly the interfaces between the individual compo-\nnents of the ground segment, but also most notably\nthe space-to-ground interfaces, require the utmost\nattention. Not least, the definition of operations\nprocesses and the writing of procedures requires a\nconsiderable amount of the preparation phase when\n\nall conceivable failure cases and corrective measures\nhave to be identified and translated into procedures.\nBecause it is impossible to cover all cases of anomalies\nin advance, the reaction of the operations teams to\nunforeseen events has to be defined so that the best\npossible solution can be rapidly determined.\n\nAfter implementation of the ground operations\nsystem, an intensive test and validation phase is initi-\nated. Computer and communication systems, opera-\ntions procedures as well as the personnel have to be\ntested and certified. Step by step the risk can be re-\nduced to an acceptable level by conducting additional\ntraining sessions and numerous simulations.\n\nIn the following sections the complex task of\ninitiating, monitoring and controlling mission ope-\nrations will be described, depending on the mission\ntype. The relevant infrastructure, control center and\nground station network play a significant role and are\nresponsible for much of the effort and reliability of\na mission. Using the example of European participa-\ntion in the International Space Station (ISS), the last\nsection of this chapter describes the special features\nof mission operations for human space flight.\n\n6.1 Spacecraft Operations\nManfred Warhaut\nSpacecraft operations (platform and payload) require\n\nintensive long-term preparations.

All operations are\nconducted according to procedures laid down in the\nflight operations plan, a comprehensive document\nprepared by the flight control team based on project/\nindustry deliverables (user manual and database), the\nscience operations plan and agreements with the prin-\ncipal investigators (PIs). Payload operations specifically\nare based on experiment user manuals, procedures and\ndatabases which the PI teams are required to produce\nand deliver to the prime contractor, who will integrate\nthem into a single spacecraft user manual.\n\nSpacecraft operations during all active mission\nphases are generally carried out following an \u201coff-line\u201d\napproach. All activities are preplanned and the resul-\nting telecommands are uplinked to the spacecraft for\ntime-tagged execution (on-board mission timeline).\nTelemetry evaluation is also mainly off-line, with the\nlimited possibility of quasi-real-time intervention in se-\nlected critical phases and in major contingency cases.\n\nThe radio frequency contacts between the ope-\nrations control center and the spacecraft are in most\ncases not continuous and are primarily used for pre-\nprogramming autonomous operation functions on\nthe spacecraft, and for data collection for subsequent\noff-line status assessment. The downlink will nor-\nmally be so configured that most of the bandwidth is\ndedicated to the dump of telemetry stored on-board,\nwith limited housekeeping and/or event telemetry\ntransmitted in real time during the pass according to\nspacecraft monitoring requirements. Anomalies will\nusually only be detected on the ground after a delay\nwhich as a minimum corresponds to the travel time\nof light, but typically will rather be in the order of one\nto several hours.\n\nThe PI institutes which have developed the scien-\ntific instruments will also define their on-board ope-\nrations. The primary responsibility for developing the\npayload operations strategy for the scientific mission\nlies with the complete science working team.\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nPayload science operations are already defined\nprelaunch according to user requirements, conside-\nring constraints from both spacecraft and ground\nsegment systems. Planned scenarios are validated\n(prelaunch) by the spacecraft prime contractor and\nchecked by the science operations center. Some mis-\nsion phases are planned without ground support for\npayload operation (i.e., the instruments will remain\ninactive or in basic, safe and autonomous low-activity\nmodes).\n\nOperations during the routine operations phase\nare preplanned and spacecraft health and mission\nprogress monitoring is conducted off-line after delay-\ned recovery of the required telemetry. This implies a\nhigh level of autonomy to be implemented on-board\nthe spacecraft at system, subsystem and instrument\nlevels.\n\nIn case of failures, ground intervention will nor-\nmally take place a considerable time \u2014 depending\non the mission phase \u2014 after the intervention of the\non-board systems. The approach on the ground will\nbe to collect the necessary information on the failure\nand the actions already taken autonomously on-board\nand, if necessary, to reconfigure the spacecraft subsys-\ntems or instruments to reestablish the generation of\nmission products.\n\nOperations (for both spacecraft and scientific\npayloads) are only conducted in strict compliance\nwith validated event sequences and procedures docu-\nmented in the flight operations plan. This comprises\nall operations activities, namely special operations\nand contingency operations, as well as routine ope-\nrations for the mission operations phase. Changes in\nprocedures and timelines produced after the launch\nare managed through the configuration control pro-\ncedures applicable to the flight operations plan. This\nincludes approval signatures from all parties involved;\nfor timelines the signatures of the representatives of\nthe project office and the spacecraft operations ma-\nnager are required.\n\nThe science telemetry packets are in most cases\nnot processed at the control center. Any information\nthat the control center needs to carry out nominal\nand contingency operations for the payload must be\nincluded either in the nonscience telemetry house-\nkeeping packet or in event telemetry packets.

The ground contact periods of\n8 to 12 hours are mostly used for data acquisition\nin playback mode and to configure new, subsequent\non-board timelines. Data transmission rates are low\n(bits to kilobits per second) and the signal reaches\nEarth only after several hours.

These tests comprise spacecraft comman-\nding from the control center, data flow tests between\nsatellite and control center, and real-time nonscience\ntelemetry data processing in the control center in\nparallel with the telemetry processing performed\nin the checkout equipment. The connection of the\ncontrol center with the spacecraft is established by\nmeans of leased data lines or by the use of existing\ncommunications facilities via a network data interface\nunit presenting the same interface to the control center\nas actually used by the operational ground station(s).\nThe telemetry and telecommand traffic is visible to\nthe assembly, integration and validation team at the\nspacecraft integration site.\n\nAsecond system validation test involving the space-\ncraft, control center, mission control software and\nspacecraft controller is performed about nine months\nprior to launch. It includes confidence testing of com-\nmunication links and final on-board software deliveries.\nAround two to three months prior to launch a third\nsystem validation test is performed for final verifica-\ntion of the integrated ground segment interfaces to\nthe spacecraft, with the spacecraft being located at the\nlaunch site. The results serve as inputs to the ground\nsegment readiness review. The final readiness decision\nis taken in the course of the launch readiness review.\nThe project and the prime contractor review/approve\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:465\n\n465\n\nthe test procedures and ensure specialist participation\n(project personnel, prime/subcontractors) at the con-\ntrol center, as required.\n\nSystem Operations Validation\n\nThe system operations validation program aims to exe-\ncute a series of end-to-end operational scenarios to\nverify the readiness of the ground segment as a whole\nto support the mission. As such, a number of standard\nand mission-unique tests are executed, such as an end-\nto-end commanding test, routine mission operations\ntest, routine phase ground segment contingencies, and\nLEOP scenario load test and contingencies.\n\nIn addition, a set of mission-unique tests is\nplanned. A test is performed to validate the capability\nof recovery of the spacecraft from safe mode, according\nto procedures supplied by the spacecraft prime con-\ntractor. Interface tests for data access by remote users\nare performed to demonstrate compatibility in terms of\nphysical/logical connectivity and application interfaces\n(file request/transfer mechanisms, command request\ncapability). This test is performed around 10 months\nprior to launch, applying an \u201coperational\u201d scenario\nwith multiple users and may include measurements\nof the turnaround times. This test is repeated about\nsix months prior to launch with the equipment of the\nPI teams installed at the control center. In case the\ndistribution of data is required ona hard data medium\n(CD/DVD), a special test verifies the production, data\nformats and structures. The objective of the control\ncenter/user center interface test is to verify the inter-\nface functions and procedures required to generate\na consolidated operation request schedule ready for\nsubsequent uplink to the spacecraft. Furthermore, all\noperational interfaces with users or user centers as defi-\nned in the interface control documents are exercised. In\ncase the utilization of (ESA-)external ground stations\nis required, their related interfaces and functions are\nvalidated. This includes telemetry, telecommand and\ntracking interfaces, exchange of state vectors and or-\nbital data for all relevant mission phases.\n\n6.1.3.4 Training and Simulations/Mission\nReadiness Tests\n\nA system simulator which is representative of no-\nminal spacecraft behavior and a number of selected\n\n2/24/09 2:11:15 PM\n",

The system simulator is the prime\ndata source for ground segment validation testing,\nfor training the staff and for exercising the complete\nground system in a predefined series of simulations\nprior to launch. The system simulator also is required\nas a means of validating operational procedures. As\ndescribed, the simulator is used prior to launch and\nthroughout the entire postlaunch mission period. The\nsimulations campaign focuses primarily on LEOP and\ncommissioning activities, as well as on critical orbit or\ntrajectory correction maneuvers, whereby some of the\nactivities may be repeated in postlaunch simulations\n(e.g., preparations for planet fly-bys and planet orbit\ninsertion and correction maneuvers).\n\nThe mission readiness tests are designed to prove\nthe readiness of the overall ground station network to\nsupport the mission in primary and backup modes and\nto validate the operational status of the ground system\nand communications interfaces. These tests are normal-\nly extended data flow tests, with additional processing,\ndisplay requirements and/or specific performance\nchecks. The mission readiness tests are organized and\nconducted around two months prior to launch.\n\nSpacecraft prime contractor staff and payload\nspecialists participate in the training and simula-\ntions program prior to launch, as well as in the actual\nLEOP activities. For routine postlaunch operations,\nindustrial and/or specialist availability is reduced to\nanomaly investigation support on a call-out basis, as\nrequired. The operational validation flow is depicted\nin Figure 6.1.3.\n\n6.1.4 Mission Phases\n\n6.1.4.1 Launch and Early Orbit Phase\n\nThe LEOP operations typically last from three to seven\ndays, starting from a few hours before launch and end-\ning with the start of the in-orbit commissioning phase.\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:467\n\n467\n\nLaunch support starts eight hours before the launch\nand includes a final readiness test with the ground\nstations. A few hours prior to launch, data flow tests\nand data confidence tests are performed with the data\nbeing transmitted from the satellite at the launch site\nto the control center. This permits final verification\nof ground system and network readiness for the final\ngo/no-go decision about 30 minutes prior to liftoff.\nAfter spacecraft separation from the launch vehicle\n(typically 20 to 90 minutes after launch), a series of\nconfiguration activities is performed automatically by\nthe spacecraft, including priming of the reaction con-\ntrol subsystem, acquisition of a Sun-pointing attitude,\ndeployment of the solar array panels and establishment\nof radiofrequency contact with the ground stations.\nAt that time the control center takes over control of the\nspacecraft and completes the initial configuration acti-\nvities including configuration of the main subsystems\n(data management system, attitude and orbit control\nsystem) and activation of the most important system\nfunctions. In parallel, precise orbit determination is es-\ntablished by analysis of the radiometric measurements,\nand the parameters for the first trajectory correction\nmaneuver are calculated if required.\n\nThe LEOP operations are primarily carried out\nfrom the main control room accommodating the\nflight director, the project representative, the space-\ncraft operations manager and flight control team,\nthe ground operations manager and the data systems\nmanager. For missions operated from ESOC the\nESTRACK (ESA tracking stations) Control Centre is\nin charge of the control of the ground stations and\nthe communication network and is manned with a\nteam having multiple-mission responsibilities. In the\nflight dynamics room a team of specialists is in charge\nof all activities related to the analysis of the dynamic\nbehavior of the spacecraft and of the calculation and\ncommand generation for the execution of orbital and\nattitude maneuvers. The project support room hosts\nthe project support team, composed of spacecraft\nexperts from the project office and the spacecraft\nmanufacturers, who can communicate directly with\nthe flight control team during critical phases or in\ncase of anomalies. All control rooms have standard\nconsoles with voice loops, alphanumeric and graphical\ndisplays of telemetry data for commanding, as well as\ndisplays of the actual position of the spacecraft.\n\n2/24/09 2:11:16 PM\n",

All ground\nsegment elements are often provided with full redun-\ndancy, and communications circuits to the control\ncenter are routed via diversified data lines. The mission\ncontrol team in this phase is structured in a traditional\nway under the supervision of the flight operations\ndirector. The organizational structure of the mission\ncontrol team typically used at ESOC is depicted in\nFigure 6.1.4. The team covers 24 hours of daily ope-\nrations in two shifts of about 12 hours each.\n\n6.1.4.2 Commissioning and In-Orbit Test Phase\n\nThe commissioning and in-orbit test phase starts after\ncompletion of the LEOP activities. In this mission\nphase additional orbit/trajectory and/or attitude cor-\nrections are implemented, if required. This mission\nphase is primarily dedicated to activation and check-\nout of the payload, instrument calibration and veri-\nfication that the overall system performance meets the\nrequirements. This involves amongst other activities a\ncheckout of the payload interfaces with the spacecraft\nsubsystems, and interference measurements between\nthe payloads and the subsystems in order to detect\npossible influences on the payloads. All subsystems not\nimmediately tested during LEOP operations are also\ncommissioned at the beginning of this phase.\n\nCommunications with the spacecraft during this\nphase utilize ground stations allowing high data\ntransmission rates. Experiment specialist partici-\npation is required at the control center for the first\nexperiment switch-on operations and subsequent\nperformance checkout. The mission products and\nthe facilities provided to payload specialists and sci-\nentists at the control center are defined in Section\n6.1.5.4 below.\n\nAll payload instruments are operated in vari-\nous operational and calibration modes, followed by\nan analysis of output measurement data including\nany relevant instrument or spacecraft housekeeping\ndata. The scientists/users will verify the correct func-\ntioning of the instruments using this data. Critical\noperations such as power-up sequences during com-\nmissioning will initially be performed only during\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nground coverage periods when real-time control and\nmonitoring of the spacecraft are possible. Details\npertaining to payload commissioning activities are\ndefined in the flight operations plan.\n\nThe control center operations are often carried\nout from a dedicated control room planned for rou-\ntine operations at a later stage. It consists of a small\nnumber of spacecraft control workstations and other\nworkstations (typically 3-4 consoles) for monitoring\nnetwork and station activities and accessing all off-line\nauxiliary systems (e.g., data disposition system, data-\nbase system, simulator, etc.). All operations requiring\ndirect interaction with the spacecraft are conducted\nfrom this room.\n\nA special room or area hosts the scientist/instru-\nment teams and their dedicated equipment for mo-\nnitoring the performance of their instruments. These\nteams have access to their data streams and are able\nto submit command requests via electronic links for\nprocessing and uplinking.\n\nDuring the commissioning and in-orbit test phase\nvery often only one ground station is used, which is\nidentical to the one planned for later routine ope-\nrations support. At the start of the commissioning\nphase the responsibility for conducting all mission\noperations is delegated to the spacecraft operations\nmanager and team, namely the flight control team.\nNetwork and station operations are carried out by\nmultiple-mission support teams in their respective\ncontrol rooms. Specialist support for flight dynamics\nactivities and maintenance of generic control center\nand mission-dedicated hardware and software are\nprovided during normal working hours, but for the\ninvestigation of anomalies a call-out scheme applies.\nThe flight control team shift pattern is aimed to\ncoincide with the varying ground station visibility\nperiods. The commissioning strategy is based on an\never-increasing use of the on-board mission timeline\nwith the resulting telemetry obtained in near real time.\nThe Pls are then expected to follow the same wor-\nking hours, in order to correct or prevent anomalies\nwithout losing a single day.\n\n6.1.4.3 Routine Operations Phase\n\nThe routine operations phase duration is adapted to\nthe mission needs and initially lasts just two years, but\n\n2/24/09 2:11:17 PM\n",

In this phase various science\nobjectives are pursued according to the master\nscience plan established by the scientists and user\ngroups. This plan provides the complete set of gui-\ndelines for science operations as well as the selection\nof orbit and attitude strategies. The mission planning\ncycle further details the plan and translates it into\noperations timelines using special mission planning\nsoftware. Routine mission operations are carried out\nfrom a dedicated control room.

Support per-\nsonnel carry out network and station operations.\nThere is no requirement for scientist/expert support\nto be present at the control center. Support for the\ninvestigation of anomalies can be ensured through\na call-out scheme as necessary. For major anomalies\nor specific critical/contingency situations, expert\nsupport is available through related contractual\nprovisions. Requirements for flight dynamics sup-\nport and for maintenance of generic control center\nsystems are identical to those for the commissioning\nand in-orbit test phase.\n\n6.1.4.4 Recovery Operations\n\nIn case a major launcher or spacecraft contingency\nmakes it impossible to achieve the mission objectives\non the basis of the available mission timeline and\nprocedures, the original mission is terminated and if\npossible redefined. In this special emergency case the\nmission control team develops contingency proce-\ndures under the lead of the flight director and mission\nmanager. If possible a new mission will be defined,\nwhereby additional facilities and/or new contingency\nprocedures will be specified and implemented. A\nrevised flight operations plan, comprising new or\nupdated procedures on the basis of actual spacecraft\nstatus, will be used to operate the new mission. This\nwill, in particular, take the spacecraft\u2019s health and\nsafety into account in order to ensure the success of\nthe redefined mission.\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\n6.1.4.5 Run-down Phase and Deorbiting\n\nSpacecraft lifetime is often limited by available\non-board consumables (fuel, batteries) and the life-\ntime of on-board transmitters/receivers. Taking into\naccount the increasing problem of space debris,\npolicies are being developed to require a controlled\nrun-down and deorbiting of spacecraft in low Earth\nand geostationary orbits. Spacecraft close to Earth are\nreentered into the atmosphere in a controlled manner\nin order to burn up the vehicles as completely as pos-\nsible. Geostationary spacecraft are maneuvered into a\ngraveyard orbit (somewhat higher than the geosta-\ntionary position) to free their location for new ones.\nThe run-down phase operations include the shutdown\nof instruments. Thereafter, the flight control team\narchives software and documentation, and compiles\na \u201cpostmission evaluation report\u201d highlighting the\nmajor mission events and addressing the lessons\nlearned during the course of the mission, as well as\ndocumenting the final cost at mission completion.\n\n6.1.5 Mission Operations Tasks\n\n6.1.5.1 Spacecraft Monitoring\n\nSpacecraft telemetry data is controlled and monitored\non a routine basis. Telemetry data analysis allows\ndetermination of trends and possible critical out-of-\nlimit conditions.\n\n6.1.5.2 Anomaly Handling\n\nThe flight control team prepares a formal anomaly\nreport comprising all operational errors or anomalies\nof the ground segment, the spacecraft and the payload.\nWhere required the spacecraft operations manager\nrequests detailed investigations and analyses from\nthe prime contractor in order to explain the anomaly\nin more detail in a separate report also containing\nproposals for the procedure to close or avoid the\nanomaly.\n\nUpon receipt of the anomaly report the spacecraft\noperations manager immediately initiates a failure\nanalysis, together with the definition, implementation\nand validation of appropriate corrective actions. After\n\n2/24/09 2:11:19 PM\n",
    "492": "6.1 Spacecraft Operations\n\ncompletion of the analysis and implementation of the\nrecovery action, the spacecraft operations manager\ndistributes a close-out report. All anomaly reports are\nstored in a database accessible to all project members\nto provide them with current information about the\nactual status of the mission.\n\n6.1.5.3 Spacecraft Operations\n\nSpacecraft operations activities are dependent on the\nmission phase and the criticality of operations. During\nground station contact periods the control center\nreceives telemetry data from all spacecraft subsystems\nand the payload. Data acquired and stored on-board\noutside the coverage periods is dumped at high data\nrates to the ground. All telemetry data is analyzed upon\nreceipt in detail utilizing mission control system soft-\nware. This includes calibration and display of selected\ntelemetry parameters, comparison of analog or digital\ntelemetry parameters with preset limits or expected\nvalues, triggering audible and visible alarms in case of\nout-of-limit conditions and the calculation of derived\nparameters combining different received telemetry data\nmeasurements of the spacecraft. This allows a quick\ncheck of the summary status of the spacecraft and the\npossible identification of on-board anomalies.\n\nThe flight control team analyzes the received\nand processed information at the control center and\ndetermines the spacecraft status on the basis of the\ntelemetry data. The reaction to detected anomalies\nis based on available contingency procedures. In the\ncase of anomaly situations not covered by existing\ncontingency procedures, specialist support can be\ncalled at any time during or outside contact periods\nwith the spacecraft. In addition to the monitoring\nand control activities, spacecraft operations require\nregular commanding to maintain functionality and\nto execute the planned operational timelines. Typical\nexamples of spacecraft commanding activities are:\nspacecraft configuration to enable ground station\ncontacts, like turning on the on-board transmitter\nand configuring telemetry transmission; starting or\nstopping data dumps from on-board storage devices;\nexecuting attitude maneuvers, maintenance of orbit\nor correction of trajectory; periodic or seasonal ca-\nlibration and configuration of sensors; periodic tests\nof spacecraft subsystems and payloads.\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:471\n\n471\n\nThe amount of manual commanding initiated by\nthe flight control team during ground station contact\nperiods is limited to minimize risk of operational\nerrors. Most spacecraft operations are preplanned and\nthe resulting telecommands are uplinked to the space-\ncraft for time-tagged execution (on-board mission\ntimeline). Telemetry data transmission is continuous\nduring contact periods and amounts to several minutes\nfor near-Earth missions and several hours for inter-\nplanetary missions, or is permanent for geostationary\nsatellites. Commanding activities are, however, always\nperformed over relatively limited time periods.\n\n6.1.5.4 Data Acquisition and Distribution\n\nData Access\n\nDuring the entire mission a data disposition system\nat the control center allows for external rapid access\nto the most recent data available via communication\nlines on a call-up basis. The data includes telemetry\nand auxiliary data, as well as related catalogs. Tele-\nmetry data (spacecraft and payload) is provided as\nraw data; that is, time-stamped packets individually\nstored on logical files according to the application\nidentification (ID) consisting of process identifier\nand data type. Auxiliary data generated by the con-\ntrol center contains information needed to assist in\nprocessing and analyzing the science data, and also\nto support mission planning and command request\ngeneration. The data may be stored on different files\naccording to its nature. The catalogs contain a full\nrecord of all data sets available and the time period\nto which each data set pertains. The data disposition\nsystem is a near-real-time processing system which\nprovides data access on a demand-driven basis; that\nis, the user or delegated representative is responsible\nfor generating appropriate data requests. The data/\nmessage transmission is via file transfer.\n\nData access is possible either at the control center\nor from a remote location and access to the data is\nlimited to authorized users. Confidentiality agree-\nments might be necessary in addition. The complete\ndata set is kept online for the whole mission duration.\nFile transfer requires network functions and protocols\nto be compatible with FTP (TCP/IP). The users are\nresponsible for providing the required terminals or\n\n2/24/09 2:11:20 PM\n",

It describes the formatting of\ndelivered data down to the level of detail necessary to\nenable users to retrieve science data and any required\nhousekeeping or auxiliary data.\n\nCommand Request Handling\n\nIn addition to the data access capability, the system\nallows for transfer of consolidated command requests\nfrom the user center to the control center as inputs to\nthe mission planning system during routine operations.\nThe system supports approval, authentication and au-\nthorization of command requests. After validation the\ncontrol center incorporates the command requests into\nthe mission planning system, which generates the final\ncommand schedule for uplink to the spacecraft.\n\nCritical Payload Operations\n\nA special control room or area for users and scientists\nat the control center provides data access and payload\ncommand request capabilities, as well as communi-\ncation with remote locations (e.g., via the Internet).\nThe interface is identical to the remote interface\nand supports both telemetry delivery services to the\nexperiment\u2019s electrical ground support equipment\nand special command requests from users.\n\nRaw Data Medium Distribution\n\nThe distribution to users of all science data and the\nnecessary auxiliary data on a raw data medium (CD,\nDVD or similar storage medium) is supported as\nrequired.\n\nRaw Data Long-Term Archiving\n\nRaw telemetry and auxiliary data is kept at the con-\ntrol center throughout all postlaunch mission phases\nin a long-term archive accessible through the data\ndisposition system.\n\nData Delivery Formats\nEach data delivery request to the data disposi-\ntion system results in the transfer of a block of data\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\ncontaining three main areas: an acknowledgment,\nincluding request details and status; a catalog entry\ngiving identification details of the requested data\nactually supplied (e.g., experiment, date, time); and\nthe requested data itself.\n\nSimple packaging in standard formatted data\nunits (SFDUs) will be applied, following a recommen-\ndation of the Consultative Committee for Space Data\nSystems (CCSDS). Apart from providing a convenient\nmechanism for handling the variable length of reques-\nted data, this standard also provides administrative\nsupport for the description of application data. Both\nthe formatting of data delivered through the data\ndisposition system and long-term data archiving\nfollow this standard.\n\nData Recovery\n\nScientific data acquisition is maximized to be com-\npatible with achievable space-to-ground link mar-\ngins. The detailed data collection requirements are\nderived from the payload interface document and the\noperations rules and constraints document for each\nexperiment. Consistent with this aim, the strategy\nfor scientific operations and scientific data recovery\nare defined in the pertinent master science plan appli-\ncable to the required mission phases (commissioning,\nroutine operations phase).\n\n6.1.5.5 Mission Planning\n\nIna typical mission planning scenario the user teams\nprovide, at fixed deadlines and with a fixed periodicity,\ninputs to the user center for the requested science ope-\nrations. The user center passes a consolidated request\nto the control center, which checks the requests against\nmission, environmental and resource constraints. For\nthe routine science operations phase, the timeline\nof the spacecraft attitude and the season (eclipses,\noccultations, Earth distance, etc.) play a major role in\nestablishing the constraints scenario against which the\npayload operations plan has to be checked.\n\n6.1.5.6 Navigation and Flight Dynamics\n\nThe term flight dynamics covers all operations related\nto spacecraft orbit/trajectory and attitude. The moni-\ntoring of spacecraft attitude encompasses analysis of\n\n2/24/09 2:11:21 PM\n",
    "494": "6.2 Control Center\n\ntelemetry data delivered by on-board sensors, gyros,\nstar trackers, Sun sensors and Earth sensors. These\nallow precise determination of the attitude as well as\nmonitoring and control of the proper functioning of\nthe related sensors and elements. Attitude determina-\ntion includes command generation for the on-board\nattitude and orbit control system of the spacecraft,\nin particular its thrusters and control mechanisms,\nin order to correct the attitude by means of special\nmaneuvers.\n\nThe orbit determination of a spacecraft is perfor-\nmed through analysis of radiometric data obtained\nfrom the ground stations. Doppler data (shift of radio-\nfrequency signals) is analyzed during the respective\ncontact periods and the spacecraft orbit/trajectory is\ncontinuously recalculated and compared to the ex-\npected orbit or trajectory. Depending on the mission\ntype, the spacecraft velocity can be determined to an\naccuracy of fractions of millimeters per second and\nthe spacecraft position to an order of meters or kilo-\nmeters. To determine the trajectory of interplanetary\nspacecrafts which have to fly by bodies in our Solar\nSystem like comets and asteroids whose position is\nnot known accurately enough, Doppler measurements\nand range/range rate measurements are insufficient.\nTherefore, other methodologies like optical navigation\nare required. This method uses images of celestial\nbodies obtained by on-board cameras. After analyzing\nseveral of these image sequences, the relative position\nand velocity can be determined to high accuracy.\n\nIn case the measured trajectory deviates signifi-\ncantly from the planned trajectory, correction ma-\nneuvers have to be planned and implemented with\non-board thrusters and the propulsion system. Trajec-\ntory correction maneuvers are also required at specific\ntimes during the mission. After launch of a spacecraft\nand separation from the launcher, the desired orbit or\ntrajectory has to be reached. For this purpose orbit/\ntrajectory correction maneuvers are required and\nthe flight dynamics team has the task of optimizing\nthem by calculating related parameters like thrust\ndurations and to generate resulting commands for\ntransmission to the spacecraft. The results obtained\nfrom flight dynamics calculations are required for\nroutine spacecraft operations. They include the pre-\ndiction of basic mission parameters like the start and\nstop of ground station contact periods and eclipses, as\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:473\n\n473\n\nwell as orbital parameters to allow pointing of ground\nstations towards the spacecraft.\n\nAdditional flight dynamics activities include mo-\nnitoring and control of the special dynamic behavior\nof the spacecraft, such as boom oscillations, nutation\nand spin velocity of spin-stabilized spacecraft, the\ncalculation of fuel utilization and remaining fuel, as\nwell as the resulting changes to the center of gravity.\n\n6.2 Control Center\n\nGeorge Hiendlmeier and Thomas Kuch\n\nThe text below, in its details, refers to the German\nSpace Operations Centre (GSOC) of the DLR at\nOberpfaffenhofen, near Munich. This control center\ndiffers from other control centers in that it hosts\noperations facilities for the support of human space\nflight missions as well as of unmanned space missions.\nHowever, the general principles are valid for other\ncontrol centers around the world as well.\n\nComputer systems employed inside a control\ncenter can be grouped into systems used to maintain\nexternal data interfaces, for routing and logging of\ndata, to process data (telemetry and telecommand)\nand to visualize data. These systems are comple-\nmented by systems used for mission planning, flight\ndynamic calculations and so-called operations tools\n(e.g., Ops-Web, which allows information exchange\nvia the Internet or Intranet).\n\n6.2.1 Control Rooms\n\nControl rooms are the \u201cbusiness card\u201d of a control\ncenter. But how did they come into existence? In the\ninitial days of space flight it was necessary to combine\nexpensive specialized hardware systems in dedicated\nrooms. Work areas for engineers and scientists were\nco-located with the hardware, and the data networks\nused today were unknown. Additional benefits were\nthe easier security control and the existing exploratory\nand team spirit of the early years.\n\n2/24/09 2:11:21 PM\n",

Who does not remem-\nber the first pictures from NASA's control rooms at\nHouston, Texas, during the Apollo missions and the\nlunar landings?\n\nToday, the hardware used in control rooms mainly\nstems from the standard lines of different manufac-\nturers. Networking technologies allow distributed\nsolutions in different rooms or even disbursed over\nvarious control centers. Increased security require-\nments have evolved from the necessity to exclude\nunauthorized persons from disrupting space opera-\ntions and/or accessing proprietary data. Requirements\ntoward ergonomic design and user-oriented inter-\nfaces have become important criteria in the design\nof control rooms.\n\nThe need for a strong team spirit in supporting\nthe cooperation of the whole team during important\n\nNASA\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nmission phases is unchanged. The ever-increasing\ninterest of the public and the presence of the media\nhave raised the quality requirements for presenting\nthe activities during ongoing operations.\n\nDifferent kinds of control rooms are found in a\ncontrol center (Figure 6.2.1). Mostly shown to the\npublic are the ones hosting mission operations. This\nis where experts on the different subsystems of a\nspacecraft are co-located with the flight director and\nrepresentatives of the owner and/or spacecraft manuf-\nacturer during the course of a mission. Depending on\nthe mission goal, the rooms are occupied for weeks\nor months \u2014 in the case of the International Space\nStation, even for several years.\n\nMission control rooms in general are furnished\nwith a number of consoles in a standard configuration\n(Figure 6.2.2 and Figure 6.2.3). The standard configu-\nration contains two to three workstations each with\none or two flat screens, a user station for the digital\n\nS/C-Checkout GFZ\nSystem\n\nFigure 6.2.1: Control center computer structure (Locations: WHM = Weilheim, NST = Neustrelitz) (Source: DLR).\n\n2/24/09 2:11:21 PM\n",

Besides specially configured work-\nstations, these rooms provide conference space for\ndiscussions within the expert teams. These necessary\ndiscussions would disturb operations in a mission\ncontrol room. Because of their specific know-how,\nthese experts usually support more than one mission\nat a time.\n\nFor similar reasons, special rooms exist for the\nconfiguration and handling of computer systems, for\nthe communications network and for ground station\ncoordination.\n\n6.2.2 Hardware Components\n\nA control center hosts numerous computer systems as-\nsigned to different tasks.

These are tailored to the\nrequired computing power. Another major selection\ncriterion is the noise emission of the computer.\n\nThe operating systems have evolved from real-\ntime operating systems (RMX, VMS, Unix) to Linux\nand MS Windows.

Using\nterminals digital voice conferencing system (Fi-\ngure 6.2.5), users inside and outside of the control\ncenter can be interconnected to subject- or task-\noriented conferences. Participants in such con-\nferences can be experts located in a control room\nonsite in external control centers or ground stations,\nor even astronauts in orbit. Terminals are configu-\nrable and may be connected to various conferences\nin different modes (listen only, talk enabled). The\ndigital conferencing node allows for the recording\nof selected conferences and time-controlled selective\n\nplayback.\n\n6.2.2.3 Video System\n\nVideo has evolved as a standard communications tool\nin control centers. Besides supporting public relations\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nactivities, video is also utilized as an operations\nsupport tool (especially in the area of human space\nflight).\n\nThe technology trend is toward digital systems;\nvideo signals are distributed as digital streams via\nthe data network and may be accessed throughout\nthe control center and on request also in external\npartner facilities.\n\nGSOC supports human space flight missions using\ndigital video.

Users of\nelectrical energy are fed from a so-called online supply.\nThis supply draws energy froma set of batteries which\nare buffered from the normal power grid. This makes\nit possible to bridge interruptions of the grid lasting\nup to 10 minutes, as well as short disruptions. Within\n30 seconds of the occurrence of an interruption, a\ndiesel-powered generator takes over the function of\nthe mains grid. This diesel system is able to run per-\nmanently which is important for long-duration grid\nfailures, and limited only by the fuel supply.\n\nThe normal power supply (grid) is provided via\ntwo independent connections to the local energy\ncompany\u2019s high-voltage network (Figure 6.2.6).\n\nAll control center-internal subsystems are supplied\nwith full redundancy.\n\n6.2.2.5 Access Control and IT Security\n\nAlthough control centers are usually hosted on the\npremises of existing security-controlled areas, addi-\ntional local-level security measures are necessary to\nprotect access to operations areas and systems.\n\n477\n\nAreas and rooms are secured via electronic badge-\ncontrolled door locks; critical areas are protected\nby additional fingerprint readers. During critical\nhigh-activity phases additional guard personnel are\non duty. All critical areas and entry doors have video\nsurveillance.\n\nIT security is a complex matter which needs to\nbe customized to mission requirements. Firewall and\nproxy systems are divided into various security tiers.\nNetworks are also split into different security levels.\nThe operations area is allocated to the highest security\nlevel and divided into projects and subprojects. Access\nto systems is password protected and implemented\nvia the well-known Lightweight Directory Access\nProtocol (LDAP) which specifies and controls access\nrights.\n\nAccess to workstations is also controlled via card\nand fingerprint readers.\n\n6.2.3 Software Components\n\nWithin a control center many specialized software\nsystems are developed to support the operations\n\nRegular power grid\n\nRegular power\ngrid user\n\nBackup power grid\n\nUPS power\ngrid user\n\nBackup power\ngrid user\n\nUPS power grid\n\nFigure 6.2.6: Control\ncenter energy supply\nsystem (EVU = energy\nprovider; G = diesel ge-\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:477\n\nnerator) (Source: DLR).\n\n2/24/09 2:12:11 PM\n",

The most important ones are described in the\nfollowing.\n\n6.2.3.1 Telemetry and Command System\n\nThe telemetry and command system is the key ele-\nment for satellite monitoring and control. In the\nearly days separate software tools were implemented\nand used. Since 1995 integrated software systems\nhave been made available, able to handle both tasks\nsimultaneously. Examples are SCOS-2000, developed\nby ESA, the American EPOCH or the German MCS\nwhich was derived from the development phase of the\n\nISS/Columbus project.\n\nThe following capabilities are common to all\nsystems:\n\ne Processing and archiving of telemetry data.\n\ne Data distribution to users within or outside the\ncontrol center.\n\ne Flagging and alarming when single telemetry\nparameters violate limits, or generating summary\nalarms.\n\ne Real-time as well as time-tagged commanding.\n\nSCOS-2000 Clients n\nTelemetry Event Command Manual\ndisplays displays history command\nTelemetry stack\nprocessing\nTelemetry Event Command CORBA\ncache cache cache\nT\nSCOS-2000 Packet CORBA\ndistribution\nPacket OB-Queue | | Command\narchiving model multiplexer\nCommand\nverifier\nTelemetry Limit Command\nreceiving checking sending\nSCOS-2000 Server\n\nTelemetry Command\n\nFigure 6.2.7: SCOS-2000 system architecture (Source: DLR).\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\ne Logging of all transmitted commands.\n\ne Managing/displaying the commands which are\nto be sent (Figure 6.2.8).\n\ne Autonomous sending of commands relating to\ntelemetry changes.\n\nThe rules specifying how commands are to be packed\nand how telemetry parameters are to be unpacked\nare defined in a special mission database. All allowed\nranges for the different parameter values are also\nstored; these often depend on the mission phase or\nthe overall status of a unit or subsystem. In order to\nachieve high reliability, two systems run in parallel (hot\nbackup) and a switchover to the redundant system is\naccomplished in less than a minute. A third system is\nprovided for critical mission phases (cold backup).\n\nThe system allows a data recall (replay) which is\nof special importance given the short contact times\nfor Earth observation satellites, or the longer periods\nof no contact for probes. It is also required that data\nwhich cannot be received in real time and has to be\ndumped from the mass memory of the probe or the\nsatellite has to be downloaded at a high data rate,\nprocessed and displayed at a higher than normal\nplayback rate. Most of the telemetry and command\nsystems like SCOS-2000 (Figure 6.2.8) support the\nrelevant CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space\nData Systems) recommendations on standardized\ntelemetry and command packet formats and ESA\u2019s\npacket utilization standards (PUS). The typical confi-\nguration of SCOS-2000 (Figure 6.2.7) is a distributed\nsystem based on a network of workstations. It may\nalso be used in a minimized configuration as a single\nconsole solution (SCOS-2000 in-a-box) for simple\nmissions or for test and training purposes.\n\n6.2.3.2 Display System\n\nTelemetry and telecommand systems do not always\nprovide a user interface that can be handled in an easy\nand intuitive way. Therefore, and because of the use\nof different software tools for telemetry and telecom-\nmand data processing required by different projects,\nthe need arises for one additional user interface layer.\nAt GSOC the SATMON display system (Figure 6.2.9)\nis used, which provides many different types of data\ndisplay in a very special intuitive way.

The specialty is that the current\nsatellite configuration can be graphically presented\non any console or on the big screen in the control\nroom, reflecting the actual status and value of the\ntelemetry.

Since the algorithms can\nbe adapted to user requirements, PLATO can be used\nfor different problem areas and applications. A server\nversion allows several users to work in parallel. Tasks\ncan be displayed hierarchically in three levels, the\nlowest level being the one which uses the resources.\nDifferent types of resources can be defined.

It contains precisely\ndefined execution times for each activity and thus\none of the executable and conflict-free solutions of\nthe defined problem. In parallel the timeline presents\nadditional options for using the resources showing all\nthe potential availabilities of resources, constraints\nand time dependencies which led to the calculated\nsolution.

Now digital links and associated\ntechnologies are employed, tailored to the detailed\nproject requirements.\n\nThese requirements define the type of connection\n(leased line, dialup line), which strongly depends also\non the available communications budget of the pro-\nject. The type of communications technology changes\ndynamically in this field. Currently, ISDN, ATM or IP\nover SDH are utilized.\n\n6.2.4.1 Real-Time Data Transmission\n\nUnlike the early days, real-time data transmission is not\nof the highest importance today. Previously real time\nwas required because pulse code modulated data was\nnot easy to store and had to be transmitted from source\nto destination upon receipt. In addition, computational\nintelligence on-board spacecraft was limited and control\ncenters had to be included in the control loops.\nToday, spacecraft have a high level of autonomy.\nTelemetry and telecommands are used to monitor and\ncontrol spacecraft functions in an off-line fashion. Pro-\ngram and parameter loading as well as housekeeping\ndata downloading are the main support functions.\n\n6.2.4.2 Offline Data Transmission\n\nOff-line data transmission is defined by time-delayed\ndata transfer from control centers or ground stations\n(e.g., scientific data from experiments). If not prohi-\nbited by reasons of propriety and high volume, the\npublic Internet or science intranets are used to support\noff-line data transmission.\n\n6.2.4.3 Audio and Video Links\n\nAudio transmission is in principle defined by the\nrequirements of telephone systems. Delays of more\nthen 150 milliseconds are disturbing in conversations\nand have to be avoided. This is, however, not feasible\nfor long-distance interconnections due to physical\nreasons. Voice discipline and adherence to protocols\nhelp to avoid problems. Transmission of video and\naudio in parallel but using different transmission lines\nrequires lip synchronization of the audio transmission.\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nVideo transmission is very susceptible to variations\nin signal runtime. Special buffer techniques help to\navoid problems.\n\n6.3 The Network of Ground\nStations\n\nMartin Hdusler and Klaus Wiedemann\n\n6.3.1 The Functions of a Ground\nStation\n\nOperational communications between a control cen-\nter (the spacecraft control and/or the payload control)\nand a spacecraft, in principle, are effected through\na ground station. The transmission of user services\nbetween the ground and the satellite is accommodated\non radiofrequency carriers.\n\n6.3.1.1 Transmission from Ground to Satellite,\nthe Uplink\n\nFor transmission on the uplink the ground station\nmodulates the signals (digital data) received from the\ncontrol center onto a radiofrequency carrier. The\nuplink transmission encompasses the transmission of\ntelecommand signals from the ground station for the\nspacecraft platform, commands to the payload, signals\nfor ranging of the space vehicle, and, in the case of com-\nmunications satellites, the telecommunications services\nof the users. To this end, the signals are modulated onto\nthe radiofrequency carrier; the carrier is then amplified\nand sent through a suitable antenna to the satellite.\n\n6.3.1.2 Transmission from Satellite to Ground,\nthe Downlink\n\nThe transmission from the satellite to the ground (down-\nlink) is typically received with the same antenna that\ntransmitted the uplink information. To avoid interference\nbetween transmit and receive signals, they are sufficiently\nseparated in frequency on uplink and downlink.\n\nThe information transmitted on the downlink in-\ncludes data on the condition of the satellite (housekeeping\ndata), data on the configuration and performance\n\n2/24/09 2:12:29 PM\n",

Today, the analog signals are generally\nconverted to digital in analog/digital converters and\nthen processed by special electronics (digital signal\nprocessors). Software processors can be used for data\nrates under 1 Mbit/s. After demodulation, the signals\nare restored to their original form. Due to the trans-\nmission from space to ground, the limited power on-\nboard the satellites and the given size of the receiving\nantennas on the ground, the signals received are not\nfree of errors. Extensive processing through filtering,\nsynchronization and error correction is required\nbefore the data can be relayed to the control center\nvia the appropriate communications channels. The\nbasic communications architecture is different for the\nvarious types of applications.\n\nThe telemetry and telecommand data (TM/TC) is\nrelayed between the ground station and the control\ncenter in real time. Navigation data, such as direction,\ndistance and velocity of the spacecraft relayed from\nthe ground station to the control center, and the orbit\nprediction data emitted from the control center to the\nground station, is relayed off-line (Figure 6.3.1).\n\nRemote sensing Earth exploration satellites\n(Figure 6.3.2) are programmed to dump the data they\ncollect during the time with no ground station con-\ntacts to a preprogrammed receiving ground station.\nFor this operation no uplink is necessary.\n\nCommunications satellites (Figure 6.3.3) have\ntransponders which convert and amplify the carriers\nreceived from the ground and then retransmit them\nback to the service regions on Earth. These service\nregions can be large scale, up to global or very large\nareas (e.g., the USA), or smaller, geographically con-\ncentrated areas served by spot beams.\n\n6.3.1.3 Telemetry\n\nIn space technology, telemetry is referred to as the\ntransmission of data generated on-board the space-\ncraft, down to a ground station. This telemetry data\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:485\n\n485\n\nFigure 6.3.1: The control of a spacecraft (Source: DLR).\n\ncan be of different types. The payload data of scientific\nexperiments can be sensor data, images or radar data\nof different objects. The housekeeping data carries\ninformation about the status and health of the space-\ncraft such as the present charge of the batteries, the\nsupply voltage, the temperature, the switch settings,\nhow much fuel is left in the tanks or information\non the attitude of the spacecraft. Often additional\ninformation is transmitted, for example about the\norbital position of the spacecraft. This telemetry data\nis preprocessed at the ground station to be passed\nonto the control center.

State-of-the-art satellites and space probes\ntoday permit reprogramming or improvements to the\non-board software, so frequent uploading of software\nhas to be foreseen.\n\n6.3.1.5 Tracking\n\nIn space technology, tracking refers to all activities\nconcerned, in the widest sense, with the tracing of\nspace vehicles, including procedures to assess and\nmeasure their orbits, using steerable antennas on the\nground. Different techniques are employed to deter-\nmine the exact orbits.\n\nWith angle measurements, angular data can be\nobtained relative to the location of the ground station.\nFor low-orbiting satellites, this is performed with spe-\ncial antennas (autotracking antennas with monopulse\nor conical scan feeds). For the tracking of geostationa-\nry satellites, step track antennas can be used.\n\nRange measurements relative to the location of\nthe ground station can be made using a transponder\nin the satellite, if available, which loops uplink signals\nback to ground. Measuring the latency of the loop-\nback signal, the distance between the ground station\nand spacecraft can be determined. This technique is\nused both for satellites and space probes.\n\nThe flight velocity of the satellite relative to the\nground (the ground station) can be determined by\nmeasuring the Doppler frequency shift (range rate\nmeasurement) between the transmitted and received\nfrequencies. For this procedure a transponder on-\nboard the spacecraft is required also, for which, in this\ncase, coherency between the received and transmitted\nfrequency in phase and amplitude is required and must\nbe known exactly. The measurement of the flight speed\nis used for remote sensing satellites and space probes\nand for geostationary satellites in transfer orbit.\n\nFor the determination of the spacecraft\u2019s position,\nnavigation satellites are used, such as, presently, GPS.\nThis works well when the orbit is suited to sufficient\nreception of such navigation signals. This is the case\nfor satellites in LEO. Transmission of this data to Earth\neliminates the need for orbit determination through\nthe ground station.\n\n2/24/09 2:12:30 PM\n",

The Network of Ground Stations\n\n6.3.2 Site Selection of a Ground\nStation\n\nAppropriate site selection of a ground station is cri-\ntical for the operation of the antennas free of radio\ninterference. Several aspects need to be taken into\nconsideration in selecting a site, such as the terrain;\nthe required property size for placing the antennas;\nthe ground structure and soil chemistry; the availa-\nble infrastructure in terms of road access, electricity,\nwater and particularly communication trunks; and\nthe radio interference at the site. The importance of\nthese aspects depends on the exact purpose of the\nground station to be built. If it is to serve only geo-\nstationary satellites, there are different requirements\nthan for stations serving satellites in LEO, which will\nremain in view of the ground station for only about\n10 minutes during one pass.\n\nIn this context, it is important to determine the mi-\nnimum elevation angle under which the satellite ope-\nration can be supported. Nearby hills and mountains\nhelp to block radio interference received from distant\nsources, but they limit the view angle of the satellite\nand thus shorten the time that a satellite is in the field\nof view of the ground station. To assess this situation,\na horizon profile should be generated for the ground\nstation; an example is depicted in Figure 6.3.4.\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n487\n\nThe figure illustrates how the surrounding terrain\ndictates the horizon. Between 120\u00b0 and 300\u00b0 azimuth\na clear view of a satellite is given for elevations above\n2\u00b0 except for nearby obstacles. Below 2\u00b0 satellite\noperation is not possible. For operation with LEO\nsatellites, an unobstructed view of the entire sky is\nrequired. Therefore, obstacles should be in the far\ndistance, and a large area is needed for the antenna. In\nthe figure there are some obstacles shown which need\nto be taken into consideration in the operation of the\nantenna, such as, at 200\u00b0 azimuth, there is an antenna\nmast (a straight line in the diagram) extending up to\nan elevation of some 14\u00b0. It will not interfere with the\noperation, but will certainly cause a small loss.\n\nAn example computation of this type of situation\nis shown for an antenna with a diameter of 11 m, that\nis an aperture of 95 m\u2019. In the near field, the power is\ndistributed cylindrically from the antenna. The anten-\nna mast (used for antenna calibrations) with a width\nof 0.7 m has a surface of 0.7 m X 11.0 m = 7.7 m\u2019,\nwith which it blocks the radiation of the ground\nstation and which leads to some 0.4 dB reduction\nof the field of view. In that situation, 91.9% of the\nradiated power still gets through; the link still works\nif an appropriate link margin has been budgeted.\n\nFor operation with communications satellites it\nmay be sufficient to have an adequate view of a given\n\n\u00b0\n\nElevation [\u00b0]\nao\n\n@\nG\n\u20ac\nsj\ni\ni\ni\n=\no\n<\n2\n\n0.0 30.0 60.0 90.0 120.0 150.0\n\n180.0 210.0 240.0 270.0 300.0 330.0 360.0\n\nAzimuth [\u00b0]\n\nFigure 6.3.4: Horizon profile of a ground station (Source: DLR).\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:487\n\n2/24/09 2:12:31 PM\n",

Often it is desirable to have several\nantennas for multiple simultaneous satellite links.\nWhen real estate is limited, the antennas must then\nbe packed together in a small space. If the antennas\ncan be arranged side by side in the east/west direction,\nthey do not cause mutual interference. If this is not\npossible, they must be co-located in the north/south\ndirection, sufficiently separated so they do not inter-\nfere with each other. Some antenna manufacturers\nrecommend, for this case, to separate antennas for\noperation with the geostationary orbit so that an\nantenna has more than 15\u00b0 angular clearance to the\nantenna in front of it (see Figure 6.3.5). One reason\nfor keeping enough separation is the generation of\npassive intermodulation (PIM).\n\nAnother aspect to be taken into account when\nplacing a ground station is the soil condition. Coastal\nregions often have quite sandy ground, which leads\nto expensive foundations; they are quite similar to\nloamy soils in this regard. Typically, the manufacturer\nof the antenna will quote the required ground com-\npression factor. In any case, it is advisable to obtain an\nexpert opinion on the soil condition to assure a solid\nand stable antenna foundation. This is all the more\nimportant if the antenna is to be used for satellite\norbit determination. Here, difference settings for the\nfoundations are the predominant problem.\n\nTo have a favorable interconnect infrastructure is\nof great advantage. Ingress and egress for personnel\nand transport are quite essential, as are connections to\nwater, sewage, electricity and the telephone network,\nand to high-speed data services. These conditions\nare typically given when there is a town nearby, al-\nthough settlements in the neighborhood can also be\n\ndirection (Source: DLR).\n\nof disadvantage because they can affect satellite ope-\nrations adversely by causing radio interference.\n\nOther sources of radio interference such as mobile\nradio and similar telecommunications systems can\nlead to curtailment of the usable frequency spectrum\nof the ground station.\n\n6.3.3 Subsystems of Ground Stations\nfor Orbiting Satellites\n\nAll ground stations have similar architectures and\nemploy similar subsystems to link up to the satellite.\nFigure 6.3.6 shows a block diagram of a satellite\nground station.\n\nThe antenna transmits all signals using the uplink\n(U/L) chain, and receives all signals with its downlink\n(D/L) chain.\n\n6.3.3.1 The Downlink\n\nFigure 6.3.6 displays three receive chains each with\none low-noise amplifier (LNA), which feed into a\nthree-channel downconverter (3 CH D/C). The\ndownconverter transposes the receive frequency into\nthe intermediate frequency (IF) and inputs it through\na downlink matrix into the baseband equipment (TTC\nbaseband). The IF used is always the same, so that all\nantennas and all carriers into and out of these anten-\nnas can operate with the same standard baseband\nequipment. In the baseband, the signals are digitized\ninto bit sequences which are relayed via the network\n(LAN) to a telemetry processor for evaluation.\n\n6.3.3.2 The Uplink\n\nIn the other direction, the commands are sent to the\nsatellite, starting with the station computer sending\n\n2/24/09 2:12:31 PM\n",

This allows flexible connection of diffe-\nrent baseband equipment to an antenna, a feature of\nconsiderable utility in large ground stations.\n\n6.3.3.3 Antenna Tracking\n\nThere are three types of antenna tracking tech-\nniques.\n\nIn the monopulse tracking system four feeds\nare arranged in the quadrants of a circle around the\nbeam axis, which receive four different signals. The\ndifference between the two upper feeds and the two\nlower feeds refers to the elevation delta, and the dif-\nference between the two feeds on the left and the two\nfeeds on the right refers to the azimuth delta. These\n\n489\n\ndeltas are converted to offset voltages which are con-\ntinuously available and can immediately be used in\nthe antenna control unit (ACU) to automatically track\nthe antenna on the target. The system is also referred\nto as simultaneous lobing.\n\nThe conical scan feed is moved mechanically\nand describes a cone. This generates an amplitude-\nmodulated signal. This sequential signal can be eval-\nuated and then used to keep the antenna pointed\ncorrectly.\n\nThe step track method is generally employed in\nfixed antenna systems working with GEO satellites.\nThe antenna is continuously moved slightly left and\nright (azimuth) and then, similarly, up and down (ele-\nvation); the received signal amplitudes are compared\nto determine the maximal signal power and thus to\noptimally point at the satellite.\n\nThis conical scan and the step track technique are\nreferred to as sequential lobing.\n\n6.3.3.4 Low Noise Amplifiers\n\nThe first LNA behind the antenna output is very\nimportant.

Thus, the relevant characteristic of the LNA is its\nnoise figure, which defines the ratio of signal to noise\nat the amplifier input to signal to noise at its output.\nThe LNA should be as close to the antenna as possible,\nwithout long cable connections or other components\nsince the losses between antenna and LNA degrade the\nsignal-to-noise ratio.\n\n6.3.3.5 High-Power Amplifiers\n\nTo implement the required link budget for the uplink\nfrom ground to satellite, generally more than one\nhigh-power amplifier (HPA) is used, which enhances\nthe output of the upconverter sufficiently to command\nthe satellite. The gain in amplification is related to the\nantenna gain, which in turn is determined through\nthe diameter and type of the antenna. The result\nis the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of\nthe ground station.\n\nThere are different types of HPAs: traveling wave\ntubes (TWTs), klystron amplifiers and solid-state\npower amplifiers (SSPA). These are briefly described\nand their advantages and disadvantages discussed.\n\nThe TWT amplifier is the most common power\namplifier in space applications. Almost all satellites use\nthis type on the downlink from satellite to ground. The\ntube requires a voltage for the heating of the cathode\nand a very high voltage of several kilovolts to accelerate\nthe electron beam. The high degree of reliability, as\nrequired in satellites, results from the relatively simple\nperipheral equipment. TWT amplifiers also exhibit\nthe high efficiency required in satellites which have\nlimited power on-board, and they have a remarkably\nbroad bandwidth (about one octave) without requi-\nring special tuning to carrier frequencies. For this\nreason their use is also widespread in ground stations\nto amplify the uplink signals, since they require neither\nfrequency tuning nor mechanical maintenance. One\ndisadvantage is the decreasing power of the aging\ncathode. The output power of TWTs ranges from\nseveral watts to several kilowatts. Even at very high\noperating frequencies, the K-band (18-26.5 GHz),\nTWTs produce substantial power levels.\n\nThe klystron works similarly to the TWT, that is\nwith a vacuum-filled tube, a cathode, an anode and\na collector. The difference is that in klystrons the\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nfrequency is set by tuning cavities. This causes the\nelectron beam which is generated in the klystron to\nbe mechanically directed through the changes of the\ntuning sections. By narrowing or widening the cham-\nbers, the electron beam is tuned to the center frequen-\ncy, the resonance. Klystrons use four to five chambers\nto generate a homogeneous transfer function. The\nbandwidth of the tuning is a function of the gain\nand the desired output power. For large bandwidths\nthe gain factor is reduced, and vice versa. The main\nadvantage of this HPA lies in the high radiofrequency\npower that it produces.\n\nFor that reason, klystrons are used in commu-\nnications requiring high power, as well as in pulsed\nradars. It is reasonable to use them when the required\noutput powers exceed the capabilities of TWTs, that is\nsome kilowatts to several hundred kilowatts, whereby\nKlystrons operate both at low frequencies as well as\nat the high end of the frequency spectrum, but they\ndo require substantial effort for general servicing and\ntuning. Also, the higher output power leads to lower\nefficiency compared to TWTs, and it also requires\ncomplex cooling systems (e.g., water cooling).\n\nA state-of-the-art type of amplifier is the solid-\nstate power amplifier (SSPA). The continuous de-\nvelopment of semiconductor technology has led to\ntransistor amplifiers with acceptable efficiencies in\nthe gigahertz range, though the power consumption\nincreases exponentially with frequency. The output\npower at S-band (2-4 GHz) is presently some 100\nW with GaAs semiconductors, with an efficiency\nof 30-40%. Power can be increased by paralleling\namplifiers which then, of course, need to be tuned\nin phase. With power combiners, amplifiers can be\nparalleled also. These show a relatively large input\nattenuation, as a function of frequency and power, up\nto 1 dBand more. In summary, for higher frequencies\nand/or higher power, TWTs and klystrons are clearly\nsuperior to SSPAs. The only advantage of SSPAs is\nthe short warm-up times \u2014 a tube amplifier requires\nseveral minutes for the cathode to heat up.\n\nThe mounting of the HPA onto the feed sys-\ntem of the antenna must produce minimum losses.\nArcing in the waveguides caused, for example, by\ncondensates can be avoided with nitrogen over-\npressure or dry air. The cost and mounting effort of\nwaveguides are absolutely required for high power\n\n2/24/09 2:12:33 PM\n",

Their flexible\ninstallation and low cost compensate the higher\nattenuation in this case.\n\n6.3.3.6 Upconverter and Downconverter\n\nUpconverters and downconverters transpose the\nfrequencies and thus connect the baseband with the\nHPA or LNA on the receive side.\n\nIn the upconverter the modulated signal is trans-\nposed from intermediate frequency up to transmit\nfrequency. The upconverter consists of a frequency\ntransformation, a synthesizer and a power amplifier.\nThe frequency translation typically is performed in\ntwo steps (dual conversion), to avoid intermodulation.\nThe mixer frequencies are generated in digital synthe-\nsizers and synchronized with temperature-stabilized\nquartz oscillators or external station reference fre-\nquencies. The transmit signal then is bandpass filtered\nand enhanced in a driver amplifier to the input level\nrequired by the following HPA.\n\nIn the downconverter the received signal output\nof the LNA is transposed to an intermediate frequency\nsuitable for the baseband equipment. Depending on\nthe feed system used, single-channel or multichannel\nconverters are employed. A multichannel converter\nis used in receive systems with a combiner and/or an\nautotracking system. The elements of the downcon-\nverter are similar to those of the upconverter, namely\na frequency converter and a synthesizer.\n\nThe received signal is first bandpass filtered, then\namplified and fed into the frequency converter. Again,\nthe frequency conversion is done in two steps (dual\nconversion) to minimize intermodulation. The sig-\nnal at the intermediate frequency is again band-\npass filtered and is then inputted into the baseband\nequipment.\n\n6.3.3.7 Baseband Equipment\n\nThe baseband equipment (e.g., CORTEX) can be con-\nsidered as the heart of the ground station. It includes\nthe telecommand system, the uplink modulator, the\nreceiver, the combiner, the telemetry system, the\nDoppler measurement system, the ranging system,\nthe simulator and data storage.\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:491\n\n491\n\nState-of-the-art baseband equipment consists of a\npowerful industrial PC equipped with special input\nand output cards for uplink and downlink. These\nuplink and downlink cards interface with the analog\nsignals at intermediate frequencies (e.g., 70 MHz) and\nthe digital PC. The downconverter output is trans-\nposed in a high-resolution analog/digital converter\nfor further processing. In the other direction; the\ndigital signal is digital/analog converted, sent through\nthe upconverter and then to the uplink. To precisely\nformat data in time, the baseband equipment has a\ntimer code card which is slaved to an external station\ntime. All frequencies generated at baseband level can\nbe synchronized with the external station reference\nfrequency. A network gateway is foreseen for moni-\ntoring and control as well as data transmission (e.g.,\nEthernet).\n\nThe telecommand system transforms the infor-\nmation sent from the control center or generated\nlocally into a predefined protocol. There is a deci-\nsion whether the command is to be handled in the\nstart-stop (i.e., the modulation is turned off after\neach command) or in idle mode (an idle sequence is\nsent between commands to lock the bit synchronizer\nin the satellite).\n\nThe uplink modulator generates the intermediate\nfrequency with the appropriate power level needed\nin the upconverter for the modulation used. Typical\nmodulations on the uplink are frequency modulation\n(FM), phase modulation (PM) and binary phase shift\nkeying (BPSK; see also Section 4.7.6). In addition, the\nmodulation index for PM and the frequency deviation\nfor FM can be set. For the input to the modulator, se-\nveral sources are available: internal, the telecommand\nsystem (TC), the ranging measurement (RNG) and\nthe simulator (SIM). For \u201cnonstandard modulations\u201d\nthere is an external modulation port (AUX).A further\noption is the sweep generator in the uplink modulator\nto synchronize the uplink signal with the phase-locked\nloop (PLL) receiver in the satellite; the sweep range\nand the sweep rate can be set.\n\nThe intermediate-frequency signal from the down-\nconverter is fed into the receiver. The receive frequency\nis set and the sweep range defined. A loop filter band-\nwidth is set corresponding to the expected signal-to-\nnoise ratio. The receiver comes in two modes, a video\nmode and a PCM mode. The video mode is used for\n\n2/24/09 2:12:33 PM\n",

For the transmission\nof high data rates with large bandwidths such as for\nsensor signals (optical sensors, magnetometers, radar\nsensors, etc.), generally the PCM mode is used with\nBPSK, QPSK, OQPSK or PCM/PM modulation.\n\nThe satellite downlink signal is polarized linearly\n(vertical or horizontal) or circularly (right hand or\nleft hand). Due to impurities the signal will have a\ncertain component in the orthogonal polarization.\nA combiner is used to receive a signal with the ma-\nximum signal-to-noise ratio in the ground station\nwhich receives both polarizations, downconverts\nthem to the intermediate frequency and inputs them\nto two receivers. The combiner then passes the better\nsignal to the telemetry system or combines the two\nsignals. The use of this combiner can improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio by up to 2.5 dB.\n\nIn the telemetry system, arranged after the re-\nceiver or combiner, the signals are PM, FM, BPSK,\nQPSK, OQPSK or PCM/PM demodulated and then\nthe bit sequence with the PCM coding (BP-L/M/S\nor NRZ-L/M/S) is checked and synchronized with\nthe nominal bit rate. Coded signals then go through\nthe decoder. Common coding techniques are Viterbi,\nReed-Solomon, scrambling and combinations of\nthese. The bit-synchronized and decoded signal is\nnow checked for the sync word and the frame length.\nA CRC check can also be performed. The processed\ndata frames, equipped with a very precise time stamp,\ncan be stored internally for future processing, or\ntransmitted to the control center, in real time.\n\nAn integral part of the receiver is the Doppler\nmeasurement system which continuously measures\nthe receive frequency and determines the Doppler rate.\nThe Doppler rate is a measure of the satellite\u2019s velocity\nand contributes to orbit determination.\n\nThe ranging measurement system includes a\nranging modulator and demodulator, serving different\nranging standards such as the tone ranging standards\nof ESA, ESA-like or INMARSAT, as well as ESA code\nranging. For the desired standard, the major and mi-\nnor tones, the amplitudes of the tones and the code\nlength for code ranging are set. To avoid ambiguities in\nthe range measurement, the minimum and maximum\ndistances to the satellite are used as input.\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nBefore the ranging measurement proper, the\nlatency of the station equipment is calibrated. The\nranging signal generated in the baseband equipment\nis modulated, the intermediate-frequency signal up-\nconverted to the transmit frequency, enhanced in\nthe HPA to the required power level and sent by the\nantenna, which, for this purpose, does not aim at a\nsatellite but at zenith, at 90\u00b0 elevation. A mixer in\nthe antenna, the \u201creflective converter,\u201d transposes\nthe transmit signal to the downlink frequency. The\nsignal is then led through the receive chain, starting\nwith the LNA. The downconverter mixes it with the\nintermediate frequency and it is synchronized and\nthen demodulated in the ranging demodulator. The\nranging measurement system now determines the\nlatency of the signal. The station latency is taken into\nconsideration in the ranging of the satellite.\n\nThe signal flow in the ranging measurement\nproper is the same as in the calibration except that the\nreflective converter is not switched on and the antenna\nis pointed at the satellite. The satellite must be set to\nthe ranging mode; that is, the uplink ranging signal\nis added to the telemetry data for the downlink and\nsent off. In the ranging system, again, the latency of the\nsignal is measured. Subtracting the station latency (as\nmeasured in the calibration) and the satellite latency\n(as supplied by the satellite manufacturer) from the\ntotal latency, and then dividing the result by two, leads\nto the latency between ground station and satellite.\n\nA simulator is used to check the receive system\nand telemetry system. The uplink modulator output\nis connected to the receiver via an attenuator.

Commonly, different reference frequencies\nare generated (at 1,5 and 10 MHz) and distributed.\n\n6.3.3.9 Data Network\n\nThe data network of a ground station should consist\nof multiple, physically separated local area networks\n(LANs). With a structured cabling in the different\nbuildings, each of these LANs and patch panels can ac-\ncess any port in the various rooms of the building. The\nconnection between the building and the antennas is\nseparate for each LAN, for example over a multimode\n50/125 ym fiber optic link, depending on the distance\nbetween the buildings (gigabit links). It is reasonable\nto physically separate the several network areas within\na ground station for security reasons, which can be\nquite important in some applications. Basically, the\nfollowing three areas can be defined.\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:493\n\nt RS 232\nTerminal\nserve Station computer_}\n$RS 232\n_ Le Time code Antenna control\nao tT and pulse\nution ne signals\n\n493\n\nOP's LNA Office LNA\n\nThe operational system (OPS-LAN) interconnects\nall buildings and subsystems in the ground station, in-\ncluding the antenna steering, transmitter and receiver,\nup- and downconverter, etc. Station computers control\nthe different antenna systems and their subsystems.\nThe OPS-LAN is connected to the control center via\nrouters and firewalls using redundant, dedicated data\nlines. Telemetry, command and orbit data is exchanged\nover this link. The transmission protocol is TCP/IP. An\nNTP (Network Time Protocol) server in the OPS-LAN\nprovides a GPS-synchronized UTP time reference\nfor all clients. At present, all systems in the OPS are\nlinked in a virtual LAN (VLAN). Additional VLANs\nfor future extensions are readily possible.\n\nThe computers of all personnel in the ground station\nare networked in the office communication system\n(OCS). The file and print servers provide data exchange\nin defined working groups. The OCS of the ground\nstation is connected to the OCS of the control center via\nrouters and firewalls using a separate, dedicated data line\nto allow personnel at the ground station to access the file\nserver of the control center. Access to the Internet and to\nmail servers is also handled over this link. Virus scanners\nand firewalls are employed for safe transmission.\n\nThe external system (EXS) allows access for ex-\nternal customers to subsystems of the ground station.\n\n2/24/09 2:12:33 PM\n",

Every single connection\nshould be kept under surveillance to allow rapid detec-\ntion and correction of failures in the network.\n\n6.3.4 Link Design Aspects\n\nThe design and dimensioning of a transmission is\ncustomized to the individual service at hand. It is quite\ndifferent for fixed and mobile applications and par-\nticularly for different transmission rates and service\navailability requirements. The physical availability\nof the link depends on the frequency range and the\nclimate zone of the ground station, both on the uplink\nand on the downlink side.\n\nThe link \u2014 the radio connection between two\npoints relayed via one or more satellites \u2014 is the total\nlink from the transmitting ground station to the\nsatellite (uplink), possibly on to another satellite in\norbit (via intersatellite links) and back to the receiving\nground station (downlink). It does not include the\nterrestrial interconnects from the ground stations to\nthe users. The handover point is in the ground station,\nat the channel encoder input, and, at the other end,\nat the channel decoder output.\n\nFor successful transmission over this extreme\nradio link the transmit power and the noise power\nmust be dimensioned on each partial link such that the\ndesired signal quality and availability of service can be\nguaranteed for the resulting total transmission.\n\nThe signal availability p as a percentage of time\nis defined for the worst month in the year; the per-\ncentage values correspond to the following outage\ntimes:\n\np= 98.0% > 14.6 hours/month\np=99.0% > 7.3 hours/month\np=99.9% > 43.8 minutes/month\np=99.99% 4.38 minutes/month\np=99.999% 26.3 seconds/month.\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nPlanned downtimes of the ground stations for main-\ntenance etc. are organized such that they do not lead\nto nonavailability of service.\n\nThe signal quality of the transmission of digital\nsignals is measured by the bit error rate (BER) or the\npacket error rate (PER), whereby\n\u00a9 agiven BER = k- 10\u00b0\u201d means that k bits of 10\u201d\n\nbits are in error;\n\u00a9 a given PER = m- 10\u00b0\u201d means that there are\n\nm-10-\"errors in a packet of size n bits (n is the\nnumber of bits per packet).\n\nTypically m= 3 for uncompanded voice, m= 5 for\ngeneral data and m= 7 or higher for critical data.\n\nThe relationship between BER and PER is as\nfollows:\n\nPER=1-(1-BER)\" (6.3.1)\n=1-(l\u2014-n BER + n(n\u20141) BER? /2\n+...+ BER\")\n=n BER\n\nFor common packet sizes and BERs, the PER is equal\nto the BER multiplied by the number of bits in the\npacket.\n\nFor the design of the transmission link, a sui-\ntable frequency band has to be determined as well as\nan antenna size for the ground station such that the\npower radiated on the uplink in conjunction with the\nfigure of merit on the downlink leads to the required\nlink quality.\n\nThe relevant parameters and quantities of the link\nare given in the following sections.\n\n6.3.4.1 Frequency Ranges\n\nThe frequency spectrum from 7 kHz to 1000 GHz is\ndivided into ranges designated by industry (Institute\nof Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), USA)\nand the military (German armed forces, NATO, etc.)\nas in Table 6.3.1.\n\nNone of these bands covers the entire frequency\nrange up to 1000 GHz. The military sequence of stages\nseems logical but is impractical since several impor-\ntant frequency ranges such as Ku-band (10-19 GHz)\nand Ka-band (20-30 GHz) fall into the same SHF\n\n2/24/09 2:12:34 PM\n",

The NATO designations are particularly\nunfortunate since they used the same letters as industry\n(IEEE), leading to misinterpretations at L-band and C-\nband (only the K-band is approximately the same).\n\nThe choice of a suitable frequency band for a\ngiven application depends on the type of service\nrequired and the availability of satellite capacity, which\ncan be leased. For communications, space operations,\nbroadcast (TV), remote sensing and reconnaissance,\nresearch and amateur radio some 20 radio services\nhave been defined by the ITU\u2019 (Table 6.3.2).\n\nThe frequency allocations are defined in the three\nglobal ITU regions depicted in Figure 6.3.8: Europe,\nAfrica and GUS (Region 1), the Americas (Region 2)\nand the rest of the world (Region 3).\n\nThe ITU endeavors to harmonize allocations\nglobally, but often sufficient consensus can only be\nachieved regionally (which is often quite acceptable,\n\n1 International Telecommunications Union (Geneva), the\n\nUN organization globally administrating the frequency\nspectrum and the orbits.\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:495\n\ndesignation.\nA-band 0-0.25 GHz\nB-band 0.25-0.5 GHz\nC-band 0.5-1.0 GHz\nD-band 1.0-2.0 GHz\nE-band 2.0-3.0 GHz\nF-band 3.0-4.0 GHz\nG-band 4.0-6.0 GHz\nH-band 6.0-8.0 GHz\nI-band 8.0-10 GHz\nJ-band 10-20 GHz\nK-band 20-40 GHz\nL-band 40-60 GHz\nM-band 60-100 GHz\nactually).

The larger the\nantenna, the sharper the beam and the larger the gain\nfactor of the antenna. The size of the antenna is the\nratio of the antenna dimension (the diameter d if it\nis circular) to the wavelength of the signal it sends or\nreceives. The gain factor G is\n\nG=10 log(u-4A m7 +r? / A\u201d) in dBi (6.3.3)\nwith yw the efficiency, or approximately\nG=20 - log(2m r/A) in dBi (6.3.4)\n\nThe unit dBi refers to dB of antenna gain relative\nto isotropic radiation with 0 dBi of antenna gain.\n\n6.3.4.3 The Radiated Power\n\nWith the electric power Pinto the antenna, two aspects\nare important:\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:497\n\n0\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0 40\u00b0 60\u00b0 80\u00b0 100\u00b0 120\u00b0 140\u00b0 160\u00b0 180\u00b0\n\ne The operating point of the amplifier. If the ampli-\nfier is not operated at saturation, the output back-\noff (BO) below saturation has to be subtracted\nfrom the value for saturation power.\ne The feed losses V between the amplifier and\nantenna input, depending on the distance bet-\n\nween the two up to V= 2 dB, must be taken into\n\naccount.\nWith that information, the EIRP can be determined:\nEIRP=P-\u2014BO-V +G (dBW) (6.3.5)\n\nIt is obvious that, to generate the EIRP, in addition\nto increasing the electric transmit power P, a suitable\nantenna gain G can be used (the best radiofrequency\namplifier still is the antenna!). Contrary to the am-\nplifier, the antenna does not require electrical power\nfor its operation, and, particularly, it does not age in\nthe same way that radiofrequency amplifiers age with\noperating hours.\n\nSo the determining transmit parameter is the\nEIRP, which can arbitrarily be composed of electrical\npower and antenna gain.

They point at the satellite without tracking it, as\nlong as the diurnal motion of the satellite stays within\nthe half-power beamwidth of the antenna\u2019s main lobe.\nMedium-size antennas (larger than 2 m at Ku-band)\nare often program tracked. The tracker is program-\nmed on the basis of the deterministic motion of the\nsatellite. The alternative to program track is step track\nor sequential lobing. The power of a receive signal\nor a beacon is measured over a fixed period of time,\nsay 15 seconds. Then the antenna boresight is slightly\nmoved right or left and the measurement is repeated. If\nthe new value is higher, the antenna boresight is moved\nfurther in that direction; if it is lower, then the pointing\ngoes back to and beyond where it was. Following this\nright/left motion, the boresight is moved up and down\nin the same manner. In this way, it will always point\nright at the satellite (step track is employed, e.g., in\nINMARSAT ship terminals).\n\nFor the very precise pointing of large antennas,\nthe monopulse system is used.

With\nthe two horizontal receivers (of the three), the phase\ndifference can be assessed, thus the misalignment\nof the antenna in the horizontal plane can be deter-\nmined. The same is true for the two vertical receivers,\nallowing the misalignment in the vertical plane to be\ndetermined.

If it is relatively\nlow (C-N <10 dB), the harm to the carrier is less. So\nit is not reasonable to ask globally for C-I > 30 dB.\nThe ratio CI is therefore referred to the C-N of the\ninterfered carrier:\n\n(c-1)- (C\u2014N)>12.2 4B\n\nThe C-I must be 12.2 dB better than the C\u2014N; the\ninterferer degrades the carrier-to-noise ratio by < 0.25\ndB. Cancelling the carrier power C leads to N-I> 12.2\ndB (with Nthe thermal noise, I the interference). Can-\ncelling the bandwidths Band the factor K (remember\nthat n=t-b-k)in N-I, we get T-T, or for T,=AT the\ninterference, or T\u2014AT>12.2 dB, or equation.\n\nt/At>16.7 or At/t<6%\n\nThe interference is not referenced to the carrier power\nbut to the noise power. The value At/t < 6% cor-\nresponds to a C-I = 30 dB for the carrier-to-noise\nratio C-N = 17.8 dB, a relatively high value. Typical\nC-N values in digital transmission including error\ncorrection are in the range of 5 to 10 dB.\n\nRelating the interference to the thermal noise of\nthe victim carrier makes the interference independent\nof the error correction employed on the victim carrier.\nWith an error correction which reduces the C\u2014N of\nthe transmission by, say, 5 dB, the error correction\ndoes not change the thermal noise N (or T), but only\nreduces the required carrier power C.\n\nThe C-I> 35 dB method, in this case, would allow\nthe interference 5 dB more power, which would not\nbe in the interest of whoever invests in coding. The\nAt/t< 6% method, in contrast, can be applied without\nregard to the possible coding that may be used, since\nit is related to the noise temperature T.\n\nThus, At/t<0.06 or <6% or <0.25 dB; however,\nthe interference amounting to 6% applies per case of\ninterference! If there are 10 cases acting on the victim\ncarrier, then the total interference is 60% so that noise\nplus interference becomes 160% (or 10 - log(1.60) =\n2.2 dB) of the noise.\n\nUplink and Downlink\n\nFor serial links, such as the satellite uplink and down-\nlink, the individual values of Ad/tare added up similar\nto carrier-to-noise ratios:\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nY At /t=Atup /tup + Atdown/taown (6.3.16)\n\nThe interference-to-noise ratio of the uplink is added\nto the interference-to-noise ratio of the downlink.\n\nThe Interference Power\n\nTo determine the interference power, both the carrier\npower C (in dBW) as well as the spectral power den-\nsity Cy (in dBW/Hz) are used. The value of Cy in the\ncenter of the spectrum is used, which is higher than\nthe average over the bandwidth b by a factor F:\n\nCy=C~10- log(b)-F (6.3.17)\n\nwhere F in the case of FM, for instance, would be 8.5\nB. For PSK, Fis smaller since the power of the carrier\nmodulated digitally is spread much flatter over the\nbandwidth B.\n\nFor the carrier-to-noise C-N < 17.8 dB the re-\nquirement LAt/t < 6% allows a higher interference\npower (an extended coexistence under conditions\nof interference) than does the C_I > 30 dB method,\nwithout undue impact on the transmission.\n\nThe requirement C-N > 17.8 dB would lead to\nlower interference powers for ZAt/t < 6% than with\nC-I > 30 dB. Such C-N values, however, are not\ncommon.\n\nThe At/t method adapts better to the C-N of\nthe interfered-with transmission than does the\nrequirement C-I> 30 dB, which dates back to analog\ntransmissions.\n\nThe Calculation\nThe carrier-to-interference ratio C-I (in dB) is de-\ntermined by\n\nC14 = Py + Goi + Gog \u2014 Lai\n\u2014 [Py + Gu5(6j) + Gea (Oj )\u2014Ly | in dB\n(6.3.18)\n\nwhere:\n\nP= transmit power in dBW,\n\nG= antenna gain = 29 \u2014 25 - log(@) in dBi and @ in\u00ae,\nL= free space attenuation in dB,\n\ne = Earth station,\n\ns= satellite,\n\n2/24/09 2:12:40 PM\n",

Each operation during a pass is\nexecuted according to the procedure, and each action\nand event is logged. The operators are in contact with\nthe control center during the entire pass.\n\nThe operation of the pass is divided into three\nparts, as follows.\n\nPre-Pass (Preparation of the Pass)\n\nThe ground station is being prepared for the pass.\nAll systems are configured and loaded with the\ncurrent orbit data. Using the data flow test (DFT), the\nreceive function of the station is tested with simulated\ntelemetry data. In a command test the correct confi-\nguration of the uplink is verified. Then the antenna\nis pointed in the proper direction to start commu-\nnication with the satellite as soon as it has reached a\nsufficient elevation.\n\nThe Pass (Execution of the Pass)\n\nThe antenna can be tracked differently during the\npass, in autotrack, predict track or step track mode.\nThe link with the satellite can be established after\nacquisition of the satellite signal, possibly after a\nsweep. Commands can be sent to the space vehicle and\ntelemetry received. High-rate data can be stored in the\nground station(s) for distribution to the control center\nand to users. Navigation data (angle values, Doppler\ndata, ranging data) is stored according to need. The\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:505\n\n505\n\nplanned end of the pass is at the predicted end of the\ncontact with the spacecraft or, sometimes, the pass is\nterminated with the premature loss of the signal (loss\nof lock) by the ground station receiver.\n\nPost-Pass Processing\n\nAfter the pass the antenna is configured to a defined\nidle position. The payload and navigation data is\ndistributed, and a post-pass report containing all\nrelevant data concerning the pass, as well as a failure\nreport, if necessary, recording and explaining expe-\nrienced anomalies, is prepared.\n\n6.4 Operations for Human\nSpace Flight\n\nDieter Sabath and Thomas Kuch\n\nIn comparison to unmanned missions, human space\nflight missions offer great advantages. The crew on-\nboard is able to work and solve scientific problems\ndirectly: that is, they can observe in situ; intervene\ndirectly if the need arises and pursue defined goals;\nperform experiments; and solve problems in case of\nanomalies. Nevertheless, a human presence on-board\nrequires considerably improved safety precautions\nand therefore such missions need longer preparation\ntimes, more redundancies, more thorough reviews for\ndocuments and tools, and thus offer reduced flexibility\nfor short-term changes.\n\nSince 2000 Europe has used the International\nSpace Station (ISS) for human space flight activities.\nFor the transportation of astronauts the US Space\nShuttle or the Russian Soyuz capsules are used un-\nder the responsibility of the respective space agen-\ncies, NASA and Roscosmos. With the berthing of\nthe European Columbus module in February 2008\n(Figure 6.4.1), ESA assumed responsibility for opera-\nting the module at the ISS. The Columbus Control\nCenter (Col-CC), operated by the German Space\nOperations Center (GSOC) at DLR in Oberpfaffen-\nhofen, close to Munich, is monitoring and comman-\nding the module under ESA responsibility.\n\n2/24/09 2:12:42 PM\n",

NASA JSC is\nresponsible for the US segment of the ISS and has over-\nall responsibility for ISS operations. The second NASA\ncontrol center in Huntsville coordinates the operations\nof the US payload racks and experiments. The ZUP\ncontrols the operations of the Russian segment whereas\nthe SSIPC is responsible for the Japanese module.\n\n6.4.1 Preparation\n\nPreparing a human space mission is a demanding and\ncomplex job because of the high responsibility for the\ncrew on-board. Due to their high costs and complexi-\nty, human missions are mostly planned and conducted\nby international cooperation. This leads, in contrast\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nto most satellite missions, to a variety of interfaces\nbetween the partners which have to be respected in\nthe design. The US Constellation Program, currently\nunder development, is an exception. This program\nis to lead to a return to the Moon by the USA using\nthe Ares-1 and Ares-5 launchers as well as the Orion\ncapsule as national assets.\n\nDuring the preparation phase of a mission the\noperations concept, the procedures and the tools\nhave to be determined, designed, developed, tested\nand released. This is done partly in parallel with the\ndevelopment of the flight hardware and demands close\ncoordination between the development and opera-\ntions teams. One approach is to integrate operations\nteam members in the development team and vice versa\nto ensure an exchange of experience and data. This\nallows operational aspects to be taken into account\nduring development and to provide the expertise of\nthe development team to the operations team.\n\nThis approach was partly introduced during the\nColumbus operations preparation phase. Additionally,\nthe operations team benefits from the experience of\nthe American and Russian colleagues, both with long-\nstanding experience in human space operations. The\nColumbus module is operated by the Col-CC, which\nhas three major tasks: first, to monitor the orbital sys-\ntem (the Columbus module), second to coordinate the\nEuropean experiments and payloads on the ISS, and\nthird to operate the ground communication infra-\nstructure with the communication connections (lines)\nto all partners. For the first two tasks the Columbus\nflight control team (FCT) has two mission control\nrooms, a planning room and several user rooms, as well\nas a backup mission control room in a physically sepa-\nrate building which can be used in case of catastrophic\nevents (fire, aircraft impact). One control room (see\nFigure 6.2.3) is used for preparing a mission increment\nwhile the other mission control room accommodates\nthe team for the real time operations execution. The\ncontrol rooms are equipped with up to 14 consoles\ndisplaying the telemetry data of the Columbus module\nin various formats to the FCT and allow access to the\ndata and video channels of the ISS.\n\nThe FCT consists of flight controllers with de-\ndicated task assignments.

The\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nsoft boundary is linked to a \u201ccaution\u201d while the hard\nboundary is associated with a \u201cwarning.\u201d This is in-\ndicated to the flight controller by a color change in\nthe display of the parameter, for example yellow for\n\u201ccaution\u201d and red for \u201cwarning.\u201d In case of serious\nfailures a station-wide caution and warning system\n(CWS) is activated to inform the astronauts of such\nanomalies or failures.\n\nBesides the parameter displays, the flight con-\ntrollers can also use graphical displays, for example\nto show the current position of the ISS in its orbit\naround the Earth or the current attitude of the ISS\nwith respect to its orbit (Figure 6.4.4).\n\nIn addition, the beginning and end of upcoming\ncommunication slots with the ISS, the on-board\nshort-term plan (OSTPV) of the astronauts and cos-\nmonauts, as well as a list of the current cautions and\nwarnings, are displayed.\n\nThe interface procedures for the operations of the\ncontrol center, the communication between the flight\ncontrollers, as well as those between the different con-\ntrol centers, have been specified in several documents,\nagreed on by the flight and ground control teams\ntogether with European and international partners,\nand tested in simulations. To ensure the safety and cor-\nrectness of the products and documents they are va-\nlidated in a multistep approach. The validation of the\non-board procedures, tools and interface procedures\nstarts with stand-alone testing, followed by simulations\nwhich become evermore complex and finally include\nanomalies or failures. After successful validation the\nproducts and tools can be used in operations.\n\n6.4.1.2 Training, Simulations and Certification\n\nBesides the tools and documents which have to be\nvalidated for operations, the personnel also have\nto be trained and certified to work on consoles.\nThe training and certification plan is adapted to\nthe various needs of the dedicated control center; the\napproach at the Col-CC is described as follows.\nDuring baseline training the use of the tools nee-\nded when working on consoles has to be learned, for\nexample the use of the voice communication system\nand the monitoring and control system.

During these simulations the behavior\nof the Columbus module is modeled by a computer\nand the reaction of the subsystems to the commands\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:509\n\nfrom the FCT is presented on the screen. The goal of\nthe simulations is to improve the teamwork of the flight\ncontrollers under realistic conditions and to present\nfailure cases of the Columbus module to the team.

For payload operations in the\nRussian segment, there are also simulations with the\nRussian control center.\n\n6.4.1.3 Interface Coordination with the\nInternational Partners\n\nOne of the most important tasks during mission pre-\nparation is the coordination between the international\n\n2/24/09 2:12:57 PM\n\n\u00ae\n",
    "531": "CHO6.indd Sec1:510\n\n510\n\npartners. The Columbus module is one of the habitable\nmodules of the ISS. Columbus is directly attached to\nthe US segment and receives its resources (air, power,\nthermal and communication services) from this seg-\nment. Hence, the interfaces with the necessary subsys-\ntems of the ISS and with the adjacent modules have to\nbe described in detail. On the one hand this has already\nbeen accomplished during the development phase of\nthe modules when the mechanical, electrical, hydraulic\nand communication interfaces between the modules\nwere defined; on the other hand, there are operations\ninterfaces which have to be agreed by the FCTs in\nHouston, Moscow, Tsukuba and Oberpfaffenhofen.\n\nTo achieve these agreements in time, common\npanels among the FCTs are established, to coordinate\na joint approach during docking, activation and com-\nmissioning as well as during steady-state operations.\nIn the panels interface procedures between the control\ncenters are determined and access to the necessary\ntools (Web pages, documents and software tools) of\nthe partners is agreed. Additionally, cooperation is\ntrained in common simulations (see Section 6.4.1.2).\nStarting in 2001 the Columbus launch and activation\nwas prepared in the European Joint Operations Panel\n(EJOP), which consisted of teams from Houston and\nMunich. In the year before the launch the teams were\nincreased by the Space Shuttle FCT, representatives of\nthe shuttle crew and, as necessary, by teams from the\nother international partners (e.g., a Japanese team for\ninterfaces with the Kibo module).\n\nA similar approach was chosen for the preparation\nof joint missions during the assembly phase of the\nISS, for instance during the ESA Astrolab mission in\n2006. In this case representatives of the FCTs from\nMoscow, Houston, Huntsville and Munich met several\ntimes to finalize the interface procedures needed for\nthe mission and agree on the use of resources on the\nground and on the ISS.\n\nIn all cases the preparation team is almost identical\nto the operations teams working on consoles during\nthe mission. To certify them for the mission, the teams\nwere trained in a staggered approach using operations\nsimulations which increased in complexity.\n\n6.4.1.4 Planning\n\nThe time available to the astronauts to perform all\nthe necessary tasks on-board the ISS and therefore\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nto execute experiments is restricted and very expen-\nsive. To ensure that it is used to the maximum extent\npossible, all activities on-board the ISS as well as the\nrelated ground activities are preplanned and coordi-\nnated. It is the task of the planning teams in Europe\nand at the partner control centers to establish these\nplans.\n\nThe planning of the activities to be performed on-\nboard is done in half-year slices called increments. An\nincrement starts with the launch of a new core team\nto the ISS and ends with the landing of the same team\nabout six months later.\n\nIn the first phase, Phase A (see Figure 6.4.5), an\non-orbit summary (OOS) is established, describing\nthe task for the entire six-month increment period in\nan executable sequence of events. This preplanning\nensures that the time available for each activity of the\nastronauts and cosmonauts is sufficient to perform\nall tasks and that all necessary resources are available\nin time. Additionally, the preplanning determines\nwhich tools, devices, experiments and disposable\nmatter have to be provided on-board and ensures\nthat the crew on-board and on the ground are trained\nfor their tasks.\n\nThe next step, Phase B, is the weekly look-ahead\nplan (WLP), which is always established 10 days in\nadvance. The WLP details the activities for each day of\nthe week, showing all required tools and procedures.\nBased on the WLP the operations teams and the crew\ncan coordinate their preparatory activities.\n\nThe last step in the planning approach, Phase C,\nis the generation of the on-orbit short-term plan\n(OSTP), released one week in advance. This plan\ndescribes the sequence of activities of the crew\non-board the ISS and on the ground in the greatest\ndetail, including all procedures and tools and all\nchanges compared to the WLP. The OSTP is the\nbasis for the daily planning conference the evening\nbefore, when the tasks for the following day are coor-\ndinated with the astronauts. The scheduled tasks are\nperformed following the plan as closely as possible\n(Figure 6.4.5). The plan can be modified and adapted\nfor the required changes caused by anomalies that\n\nmay occur when an experiment is executed, or by\nother unforeseen events. The planning team tries to\nshift delayed activities to one of the next free slots in\n\nthe schedule.\n\n2/24/09 2:13:02 PM\n",

Nevertheless, a substantial\npart of the available time has to be invested in securing\nand maintaining the necessary living and working\nconditions for the astronauts. Two of the three astro-\nnauts on-board the ISS in 2007 had the sole task of\nperforming maintenance on the ISS modules and\nrepairing faulty parts. Only half of the working time\nof the third crew member was available for conducting\nexperiments and for payload operations.\n\nIn addition to the work of the ISS crew, the FCTs\nin the control centers provide an enormous amount\nof support to keep the ISS operational. In the control\ncenters in Houston and Moscow, and since 2008 also\nin Munich and Tokyo, the FCTs work around the clock\n\nCHO6.indd Sect:511\n\n511\n\nto operate the module assigned to their responsibility.\nThe teams ensure that the module is working cor-\nrectly, that the necessary maintenance is performed\nin time, that the environmental conditions for the\nastronauts are met, and that the payload operations\ncan be performed.\n\n6.4.2.1 System Operations of the Columbus\nModule\n\nThe main task of the FCT at the Col-CC is to activate,\ncommand and monitor the Columbus module after its\nberthing with the space station (see Figure 6.4.6).\nThe FCT, which is available 24 hours a day in three\nshifts during steady-state operations, has to ensure\nthat the environmental control and life support\nsystem (ECLSS) is working correctly, and that the\npower supply and distribution are working properly\nand providing sufficient power to the subsystems and\nexperiments. Additionally, the thermal subsystem for\ncooling the subsystems and experiments has to be\nmonitored, and it must be assured that all data, video\nand audio connections are properly routed. In case of\nanomalies or faulty equipment the team has to perform\ncountermeasures and provide a description of the fai-\nlure to the engineering support team for analysis.\nThe engineering support team consists of experts\nfrom the manufacturers of the various subsystems of\n\nFigure 6.4.6: Columbus module at ISS Node 2 (Harmony module)\n(Source: ESA).\n\n2/24/09 2:13:03 PM\n",

They are\ninformed by the FCT about failures in the module and\nprovided with the necessary data. The ESC analyzes\nthe anomaly, tries to reproduce the failure in simu-\nlators on the ground, and issues a recommendation\non how to solve the problem. It is the task of the FCT\nto execute the recommended procedures in order to\nregain the full functionality of the module.\n\n6.4.2.2 Environmental Control and Life Support\nSystem\n\nThe Columbus module is one of the pressurized\nelements of the ISS and has to provide a shirtsleeve\nenvironment for the astronauts. Despite the lack of\nits own resources for power, air and cooling (these are\nprovided via the US elements of the ISS), the FCT is\nresponsible for the correct environmental conditions\ninside the module. The operator on the systems po-\nsition (see Table 6.4.1) monitors the ECLSS and the\nparameters for the environmental conditions in the\nmodule. It has to be ensured that the air inlet and\noutlet flows, the air circulation within the module,\n\nthe oxygen and the CO, concentrations, as well as the\nhumidity, are in the correct range.\n\nIt is also the task of this operator to perform pre-\nventive maintenance of the ECLSS together with the\nISS crew. In the case of anomalies the operator will\ninitiate the commands to switch over to the backup\nsystems. The monitoring and the maintenance of the\nsmoke detectors are also under the responsibility of\nthe operator on the systems position.\n\n6.4.2.3 Power Supply and Thermal Control\n\nThere are two independent power connections pro-\nviding power from the solar generators, or in shadow\nphases from the batteries, to the ISS modules. Hence,\nclose cooperation between the responsible positions\nin the various control centers is necessary, because\nincreased power consumption in one module or the\npartial failure of a power subsystem directly influences\nall modules.\n\nMonitoring the power subsystem within the\nColumbus module and coordination with the ISS\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\npartners are also the responsibility of the operator\non the systems position. The flight controller has to\nensure that the subsystems and experiments receive\nthe power needed without exceeding the maximum\nallowed power consumption. Since a large part of the\nenergy is transformed into heat, the experiments and\nsubsystems have to be actively cooled. The excess heat\nis transferred via heat exchangers to the main cooling\nsystem and then radiated into space by radiators\noutside the ISS. The flight controller at the systems\nposition has to ensure that one of the two water\npumps is running all the time and that there is no\nleakage in the cooling lines. In the case of anomalies\nthe backup system is activated, or in the case of a total\nfailure most of the subsystems and all experiments\nare switched off.\n\n6.4.2.4 Data and Communications System\n\nThe data of the Columbus subsystems and the payloads\nare collected by the data management system (DMS)\non-board the Columbus module. The data is combined\nin packets and transferred via the US tracking and data\nrelay satellite system (TDRSS) to the NASA ground\nstation at White Sands, New Mexico. The data is then\nrouted to the control center in Houston and relayed to\nthe Col-CC via the ESA interconnection ground subnet\n(IGS) (see Section 6.4.4 and Figure 6.4.1). The operator\non the DMS position is responsible for monitoring and\ncommanding the DMS and monitoring data collection\nin the Columbus module.\n\nThe coordination of data transfer from the Co-\nlumbus module via NASA and ESA communication\nlines is the task of the communication officer. Due to\nrestricted bandwidth availability, not all parameters\nof the Columbus module can be sent to the ground in\nparallel. Hence, the FCT has to select those telemetry\npackets most suitable for the current task using the\nrelevant predefined parameters. The communication\nofficer is then responsible for switching the packets\ncontaining the necessary parameters.\n\n6.4.3 Coordination of ISS Payload\nOperations\n\nBesides the Columbus system operations, the coordi-\nnation of payload activities is one of the main tasks\n\n2/24/09 2:13:30 PM\n",
    "534": "6.4 Operations for Human Space Flight\n\nof the international partner (IP) control centers. As\nalready explained, the Payload Operations and In-\ntegration Center (POIC) at the MSFC in Huntsville\nperforms the payload coordination for NASA. POIC\ncoordinates all payload operations activities in the US\nsegment of the space station as well as all the payload\noperations for equipment racks integrated in other\nISS modules. POIC cooperates closely with the space\nstation control center at JSC in Houston. JSC is re-\nsponsible for coordinating overall ISS operations and\nall interfaces (power, cooling, data, video and voice)\nwith the other ISS modules.\n\nRussian experiment operations on the ISS are,\nas system operations, under the responsibility of the\nTsUP in Moscow. In contrast to this approach the Eu-\nropean ISS ground infrastructure has a decentralized\nstructure with the central Col-CC and nine USOCs in\ndifferent European countries. (see Table 6.4.2 below).\nThe Col-CC coordinates the payload operations in the\nColumbus module with the user centers and with the\ncontrol centers of the international partners.\n\nExploitation of the ISS is a common task of all the\ninternational partners. Therefore, close cooperation\nis required for payload operations and for providing\nthe necessary resources in time. Payload operations\ncan only be started after all relevant tools have been\nflight qualified and after the formal approval process\nin all involved control centers has been successfully\ncompleted.\n\n6.4.3.1 Payload Coordination at Col-CC\n\nAt Col-CC the operations coordinator (OC) is the\nperson responsible for experiment operations (Table\n6.4.1). The flight controller is in close contact with\nthe flight controllers at POIC and agrees with them\nthe sequence of payload operations. If European\nexperiments are performed in the Russian segment\nof the ISS, the OC has to coordinate with the flight\ncontrollers at TsUP, too. The necessary communica-\ntion lines for voice, data and video as well as the ne-\ncessary resources are established and monitored by the\nsystems, the \u201ccomms\u201d and the DMS engineers (see\nTable 6.4.1), together with their colleagues at NASA.\nNASA is the most important partner because Col-CC\nhas most of its system and payload interfaces with the\ncontrol centers in Houston and Huntsville.\n\nCHO6.indd Sec1:513\n\n513\n\n6.4.3.2 Coordination with the USOCs\n\nThe points of contact for European scientists who\nwant to perform experiments on the ISS are the nine\nUSOCs. Table 6.4.2 describes the task distribution\namong the USOCs. Five USOCs are responsible for\nall the internal payload racks and external payloads.\nThe others are responsible for single experiments in\nthe payload racks, performing experiments in the US\nor Russian segments, or supporting other USOCs in\ntheir payload operations activities.\n\nThe user centers support the scientists in pre-\nparing the experiments for transport to the ISS and\nduring the execution of operations there. Additionally,\nthey provide console positions for scientists monito-\nring and commanding their experiments or they set\nup communication lines to the home institutes of the\nscientists. The commands from the user centers are\nsent via the ground communication network to the\nCol-CC and forwarded to the control centers of the\ninternational partners and further on to the experi-\nments on-board the ISS.

The experiment data is recorded and analyzed\nby the scientists at the user centers or at the relevant\nuniversities and research institutes.\n\n6.4.3.3 Coordination with ESA\n\nESA is one of the international partners of the ISS\nand is responsible for the European contribution\nto it. Hence, ESA selects the experiments which are\nperformed on the ISS and places contracts with the\nUSOCs for ISS scientific exploitation. Similarly, con-\ntracts are placed with the Col-CC for payload and\nsystem operations via the prime contractor Astrium\nas industrial operator vis-a-vis ESA. When preparing\na new ISS mission or a new increment, ESA defines\nthe scope and selects the experiments which are to\nbe performed. ESA negotiates with the international\npartners on the coordination of all European ISS\nexploitation activities and places contracts for the\ntransportation of astronauts and payloads to and from\nthe ISS. During operations the FCT is in permanent\ncontact with the ESA operations manager to coordi-\nnate and agree on actions in case of unforeseen events\nor to change operations priorities. Additionally, ESA\nteam members work closely together with the FCT\nfor operations execution: the ESA MedOps and the\nflight surgeons monitor the astronauts\u2019 health and set\nup the necessary training programs; for example, for\nminimizing the loss of muscle and bone mass of the\nastronauts under microgravity conditions. ESA also\ncontributes the Eurocom team (see Table 6.4.1), which\nis responsible for the direct communication with the\nESA astronauts on-board the ISS.\n\n6.4.4 The ISS Communication\nInfrastructure\n\nThere are two independent means of communication\nfor routing data, voice and video to and from the ISS.\nThe first one uses NASA\u2019s TDRSS, which provides a\nnearly continuous communication link to the ISS by\nusing one ground station and communicating with\nthe appropriate TDRSS satellites in geostationary orbit\n(see Figure 6.4.7). The main US communication link\nto the ISS is routed from the control center in Houston\n\n6 Mission Operations\n\nto the ground station in White Sands, and from there\nto the TDRSS satellites. The signal is then transferred\nfrom the satellite to the ISS. Voice, video and data\nsignals from the ISS are sent back the same way.\n\nThe second communication link is provided by the\nRussian communication system, which relies on five\nground stations located between the Baltic Sea and\nthe Pacific Ocean. In the optimum case a continuous\ncommunication link of more than 20 minutes is pos-\nsible. The Russian FCT can also use the US satellite\ncommunication system when the ISS is out of range\nof its own ground station network since Russia does\nnot have a dedicated satellite communication system\nat present.\n\n6.4.4.1 Operations of the European\nCommunication Infrastructure\n\nThe European interconnection ground subnet (IGS)\nconnects the Col-CC with the control centers of the\ninternational partners in Houston, Huntsville and\nMoscow because the Col-CC has no antennas for\ncommunication with the ISS (see also Figure 6.4.7).\nHowever, the Col-CC not only routes system and pay-\nload data to and from the Columbus module, but also\ndistributes to the ATV control center (ATV-CC), via\nthe IGS, the ATV flight data and the data from docking\nand undocking activities as well as data generated\nduring docked operations at the ISS. The automated\ntransfer vehicle (ATV) is the European resource ve-\nhicle (Figure 6.4.8). It is launched by an Ariane 5 from\nthe European launch center at Kourou and can carry\nup to 10 tonnes of resources (food, oxygen, nitrogen,\nwater and fuel) as well as experiments to the ISS.\n\nEach IGS communication connection consists of\na prime and a backup line in order to switch to the\nbackup line in case of failure. The main communica-\ntion links (data, voice and video) to the ISS and to the\nColumbus module are routed via the Mission Control\nCenter in Houston. However, the experiment data is\nprovided via the POIC, the NASA payload control\ncenter in Huntsville.\n\nThe ground communication network has to\nprovide high reliability because it is the only com-\nmunication link for commands as well as voice com-\nmunication with the astronauts on the ISS. This\nhigh reliability of the communication network is\n\n2/24/09 2:13:31 PM\n",

Nevertheless, mili-\ntary considerations were clearly at the forefront during\nthe development of rocket technology. The early phase\nof space activities in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury was marked by technological competition\nbetween the two superpowers, the USA and the Soviet\nUnion, and an enormous amount of public financing\nwas accordingly spent on pretentious space projects.\nBut also during this phase, aspects of utilization, par-\nticularly those of a scientific nature, were continually\nemphasized and received the corresponding priority.\nSputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, was laun-\nched on October 4, 1957 with a payload consisting\n\nonly of a transmitter. It had no other function but to\ndemonstrate its existence in orbit \u2014 to overwhelming\nand sensational effect. The first US satellite, Explorer\n1, launched in January 1958, carried as science payload\na Geiger counter designed by James Van Allen. Despite\nthe unexpected saturation of its detector, its measure-\nments led to the discovery of the radiation belts which\nbear his name, and formed the foundation for the\ninvestigation of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere.\n\nPotentials for Exploiting Space\n\nSpace offers a wide spectrum of unique qualities and\nambient conditions which make it interesting or even\nessential for a variety of application areas (Figure 7.1).\nFound here are the new potentials and impulses for\n\nView toward Presence) Ambient conditions eerie\nApplication area Earth Space inspace = Vacuum __ Radiation cae dimensions\n\nEarth surface\n\nCCU\n\nClimate and environment\n\nCoU| \u00a9\n\nCCE\n\nAtmosphere and weather\n\n\u00a9\n\nCommunication\n\nCCU\n\nNavigation\n\n\u00a9\n\n\u00a9\n\nOOOO\n\nCCU\n\nAstronomy and astrophysics\n\n\u00a9\n\nie) CU\n\nPlanetary research\n\nCCU\n\nCCU\n\nCU\n\nMaterials sciences\n\nLife sciences\n\n1\")\n\n(@)| \u00ab| @)\n\nCU\nCoCo\n\n\u00a9 COC CO\n\nTechnology\n\n\u00a9\n\n\u00a9 On \u00a9) GC.\n\nFigure 7.1: Specific qualities of space and relevant application fields.

The images which showed\nus our home planet from a new perspective contri-\nbuted to the change of human paradigms and es-\ntablished a new understanding of our environment.\nContiuously improved cameras provide images of the\nEarth\u2019s surface at astonishingly detailed resolution,\ndown to 1 m. Presentations such as \u201cGoogle Earth\u201d\nare making them easily accessible to anyone and part\nof everyday life. Less well known are the distinctions\nnow possible with hyperspectral resolution, which\nhas vastly expanded information content and is being\nput into operational use in many areas. The metho-\ndology of radar monitoring, which provides detailed\nimages of the Earth\u2019s surface both day and night, also\nthrough clouds, has led to innovative applications in\na variety of fields.\n\nWeather maps and forecasts based on satellite\ndata have become a part of the modern news scene.\nWeather forecasts of up to two weeks are inconcei-\nvable without meteorological satellites. A look at\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere from low Earth orbit also\nprovides new insights, since it enables us to monitor\nour planet\u2019s gaseous envelope from its lowest to its\nhighest density, which makes possible measurements\nwith improved resolution. Along with such a global\nview, climate effects can also be detected and reasons\nfor changes identified. One example is the discovery\nof the ozone hole, which initiated a reversal in anthro-\npogenic influences through a worldwide ban on\nchlorofluorocarbons.\n\nTechnological developments associated with\ncommunication and navigation in space make use\nof global visibility from and to the Earth\u2019s surface.\nIn both areas commercial applications have gained\nacceptance and further developments are underway.\nIn the intercontinental voice communication or tele-\nphone market, satellite communication was first able\nto supplant inadequate cable technology, only to be\nsupplanted in turn by fiber optic communication \u2014 at\nleast in major population centers. Today there are\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\ninteresting markets in large developing countries\nand in mobile communications. Radio and especially\ntelevision transmission via satellite are economically so\ninteresting that these services are being offered to the\nuser free of charge. This is also the case for available\nnavigation services. Whereas the American GPS system\nwas taken over from the military sector, a European\ncommercial system, Galileo, is being developed with\nreturns expected from value-adding services.\n\nViewing Space from the Earth\n\nAlthough Earth\u2019s atmosphere appears to be completely\ntransparent to the human eye, this is true only for\nsmall parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, namely\nthe visible and radio ranges (Figures 7.2 and 7.4.1).\nFrom a vantage point beyond the atmosphere, a view\nof space reveals wide, new spectral ranges which are\nentirely untransparent or offer only limited access to\ninstruments on the Earth\u2019s surface. Space astronomy\nnot only made possible a large number of new disco-\nveries; it also helped to newly define our view of the\ncosmos.\n\nElectromagnetic cosmic radiation is to be found at\nthe extreme energy-rich end of the spectrum. Imaging\ntechnologies cannot be applied here; the information\ncoming from the depths of the Universe is obtained\nusing the measurement methodologies of particle phy-\nsics. In the X-ray range, high-energy cosmic sources\nsuch as quasars, pulsars and black holes are imaged\nand measured spectrally with grazing-reflection optics.\n\nFigure 7.2: Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which appears transparent to\nthe human eye, absorbs most of the electromagnetic spectrum\n(Source: NASA).\n\n2/24/09 2:38:02 PM\n",

This radiation pene-\ntrates the Universe\u2019s dust-laden regions and makes\nit possible to detect cold objects and processes such\nas the birth of stars. In the microwave range Earth\u2019s\natmosphere is basically transparent. But satellite\ninstruments were nevertheless necessary to measure\ncosmic microwave background radiation, since it is\nonly the tiniest fluctuations, not measurable through\nthe atmosphere, which provided the decisive infor-\nmation which confirmed our present cosmological\n\nmodel of the big bang.\n\nPresence in Space\n\nSome tasks require a physical presence in space. This\ndoes not inevitably mean the presence of humans. A\nrobot in space can perform valued services, whether\ninteractively controlled from the ground (telepres-\nence) or operating autonomously. Due to safety\nrequirements and the need for life support systems, the\ntechnical effort to place humans in space is high. The\nadvantage is in intellectual performance and flexibility,\nwhich cannot be achieved by any robot system. But\nthis does not lead to a general preference for either\nhuman or unmanned space activities. Depending on\nthe requirements set by the goal of the mission, the\nmost efficient approach has to be selected. It would\nnot make much sense to place a robot in space to\nconduct medical investigations relating to reversible\naging processes, for example.\n\nA presence in space is often required to research\nlocal fields or particle fluxes. Detailed temporal and\nspatial relationships within Earth\u2019s magnetosphere\ncan only be measured by exploiting the simultaneous\npresence of several probes at various known locations.\nThe first step toward achieving a local presence is to\nvisit objects in our planetary system for the purpose\nof undertaking instrument-based in-situ studies from\nnearby. All the planets and several of their moons have\nbeen observed during fly-by missions or from orbit.\nThe results have considerably expanded our know-\nledge, and the images which were sent back reveal\nunexpected, exotic worlds. The next step is to land ins-\ntruments for in-situ investigations (Figure 7.3). The\nprecondition for landing people on some objects in\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:521\n\n521\n\nFigure 7.3: In-situ investigations of planetary bodies contribute\nconsiderably to an increase of knowledge. The landing of the Viking\nspacecraft on Mars in 1976 is a milestone in the research of our\nplanetary system (Source: NASA).\n\nspace is mastery of return-flight technology. For that\npurpose there is an interim stage, in which material\nfrom a body in our planetary system is brought back\nto Earth for analysis. This verifies the return tech-\nnology. At the same time, prior precise investigation\nof the extraterrestrial material increases the safety\nof humans subsequently placed on the surface of a\nforeign planetary body. For long-duration presence,\nresources must be generated locally for fuel, energy\nand material.\n\nAmbient Conditions in Space\n\nThe density of the atmosphere drops exponentially\nwith altitude from its value on the Earth\u2019s surface of\n3-10\"? molecules per cubic centimeter. In low Earth\norbits of about 250 km altitude, particle density is still\nabout 10\" per cubic centimeter. A decisive criterion\nfor the utilization of space is the question of the stabi-\nlity of the orbit. Some mission goals, such as for Earth\nobservation or communications, call for low orbits.\nBelow 120 km, a satellite\u2019s lifetime in orbit, which is\nalso strongly dependent on solar activity, is too short\nfor practical purposes. Above 600 km, atmospheric\ndrag, which depends on the size, shape and orientation\nof the space vehicle, is no longer the limiting factor for\nservice life, which at this orbit height is over 10 years.\nBeyond 1000 km, the Sun\u2019s radiation pressure exceeds\nthe influences of the remaining atmosphere.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:11 PM\n",
    "543": "CHO7.indd Sec1:522\n\n522\n\nMissions with the goal of utilizing microgravity\nare likewise limited by the resistance of atmospheric\nfriction or drag. The influence of this force depends\non the relationship between the mass and atmosphe-\nric drag of the space vehicle. Satellites designed for\nthe special purpose of measuring relativity effects\nor details of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field have to be\nkept ina Keplerian orbit independent of residual atmo-\nspheric drag. This is achieved by using sophisticated\ncompensation techniques to follow the position of a\nfree-floating internal test mass.\n\nThe ambient vacuum is used directly in experi-\nments in plasma physics or molecular physics. For\ncertain scientific experiments, a suitable interface to\nthe outside of a pressurized laboratory module can\nprovide the required vacuum.\n\nThe electromagnetic radiation in the vicinity\nof a space vehicle is dominated by the influence of\nthe Sun. The spectrum of the radiation emitted by\nthe Sun ranges from X-rays to radio waves, with a\nmaximum in the visible range at about 500 nm. This\nis essentially the spectrum of black body radiation at\n5800 K, with variations at the two extreme ends of the\nhard and infrared radiation ranges. At these borders\none finds distinct fluctuations caused by solar activity,\nwhereas the total flux, expressed by the solar constant\nof 1371 W/m\u2019, remains basically unchanged.\n\nOutside the protective envelope of the atmosphere,\na space vehicle is exposed to the total particle flux o:\nspace. This consists of elementary particles, ions and\natomic nuclei. In the high-energy range this particle\nradiation penetrates organic as well as inorganic mat-\nter and can cause damage which affects the health o:\nastronauts or causes equipment to malfunction.\n\nThis particle flux comes almost entirely from the\nSun in the form of the solar wind, which is composed o:\nprotons, helium nuclei (alpha particles) and electrons.\nWith flux velocities of 400 km/s this is equivalent to\nkinetic temperatures around 10 000 K or energies o\n1 keV. Solar storms or eruptions can release signifi-\ncantly higher amounts of energy, which can approach\nthe realm of cosmic radiation at over 10 GeV. With\nincreasing energy, the particle flux of 10\u2019\u00b0 per square\ncentimeter and second at 1 keV drops by 18 orders of\nmagnitude in the gigaelectronvolt range.\n\nGravity is ubiquitous in space. It originates from\nthe overlapping of the gravity fields of all the masses\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\ndistributed throughout the Universe. It can be neither\nscreened nor switched off. Since this force decreases\nwith the square of distance, our planetary system\nis dominated by the gravity of the Sun, which has\n750 times as much mass as all the other planetary\nbodies taken together. Only in the immediate vicinity\nof another body does that body\u2019s own gravity field\npredominate.\n\nEarth\u2019s gravity field at the altitude of stable orbits,\nabout 250 km, is still about 93% of the value on\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. Weightlessness arises through\ncompensation of the remaining gravity influences by\nthe inertial forces arising from the satellite\u2019s motion,\nwhich in the case of an orbit coincides with the cen-\ntrifugal force.\n\nMicrogravity in space was an attractive pheno-\nmenon even in the early days of space activity. On the\nground, equivalent conditions can only be achieved\nwith drop towers, parabolic aircraft flights and sub-\norbital rocket flights, but only with inevitable restric-\ntions as to the time available for experiments and the\nquality of the gravity reduction. Under conditions of\nmicrogravity, the effects of sedimentation, convection\nand hydrostatic pressure disappear, which leads to\nnovel conditions, particularly for studying processes\ninvolving at least one fluid component. In the research\nfields of materials sciences, medicine and biotechno-\nlogy, as well as in the field of basic physics, innovative\nresults can be obtained and new approaches developed\nfor industrial processes on the ground.\n\nThe European space laboratory Spacelab\n(Figure 7.4) was designed primarily for scientific\nresearch under conditions of orbital microgravity.\nWith its 25 missions it was the Space Shuttle\u2019s most\nfrequently flown payload and was the foundation for\nthe development and utilization of the International\nSpace Station.\n\nGlobal and Cosmic Dimensions\n\nIn space there are no limits placed on the fantasy and\ninspiration of scientists and engineers. In the vastness\nof space, coupled with an absence of gravity effects,\nstructures of gigantic dimensions can be imagined.\nWernher von Braun had already developed in the\n1950s concepts for huge space stations; even artificial\ncolonies to house fractions of Earth\u2019s population were\nenvisioned.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:15 PM\n",

Early attempts by\nthe USA to conduct military reconnaissance using\ncamera-equipped satellites flying over the Soviet Union\nare known. Improvement of weather forecasts based\non observations of weather phenomena from space\nis now a matter of course, and even high-resolution\nimages of the Earth on the Internet are now drawn on\nby a large number of the most varied users.\n\n7.1.1 Categories of Earth Observation\nApplications\n\nWeather Observation and Atmospheric Conditions\nMonitoring the momentary state of the weather from\nspace is one of the oldest applications for satellite\ntechnology. The USA\u2019s Vanguard 2 satellite (launched\nin 1959) measured the reflection of sunlight from the\nEarth and clouds (albedo) as part of the International\nGeophysical Year (IGY) and can be regarded as one of\nthe first systems for monitoring weather and climate\nparameters. In 1960 the US TIROS satellite provided\nthe first black-and-white images using a video camera.\nThe successor system already included infrared spec-\ntral range observations. The sequence of weather and\nenvironmental satellites in low Earth polar orbits\ncontinued in 1970 with the satellite series of the US\nweather agency NOAA. With its advanced very high-\nresolution radiometer (AVHRR, with approx. 1 km\ngeometric resolution on the ground) the NOAA series\nof weather and environmental satellites still provides\nthe basis for mapping many atmospheric, land and\nwater parameters (e.g., vegetation indices, ground\nand water surface temperatures) on a daily, global\nbasis (see Figure 7.1.1). After 2006 the MetOp satellite\nof the European Organization for the Exploitation\nof Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) comple-\nmented this fleet and added additional functionality,\nparticularly for measuring atmospheric trace gases.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:16 PM\n",

Especially,\nmeasurements of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d over many years\nreveal important parameters for analyzing and pre-\ndicting global climate change.\n\nAlmost constant weather monitoring for given\nlocations on Earth from space is possible with geosta-\ntionary weather satellites. Since the launch of the US\nGOES-A satellite in 1975 further geostationary weather\nsatellites have been added. At present (2008) the USA/\nNOAA (135\u00b0W and 75\u00b0W), EUMETSAT (0\u00b0 and 63\u00b0E),\nthe Russian Federation (76\u00b0), China (105\u00b0) and Japan\n(140\u00b0) operate geostationary weather satellites, whose\ndata provide a view of the entire hemisphere at up to\n15 min intervals with a resolution of 1 km in nadir\n(this information relates, for example, to the SEVIRI\nsensor on the newest Meteosat satellites).\n\nThe data from geostationary satellites is usually\nreceived at central ground stations, processed, and\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nin some cases transmitted in processed form directly\nvia a transponder on-board the same satellite. The\nEUMETCAST service of EUMETSAT allows digital\nreception of additional environmental parameters\nwith an 85 cm Ku-band antenna and an appropriate\nPC interface.\n\nBesides the climate and weather data generated by\nnational weather services and increasingly also by pri-\nvate suppliers, all data is combined into a total picture\nat international data centers. The European Centre\nfor Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)\nin Reading, UK, is one of the institutions which\ngenerates long-term weather forecasts from satellite\ndata and models of the atmosphere.\n\nMonitoring the Environment\n\nMonitoring changes on the land surface, especially\nvegetation related to agriculture and forestry, has\nbeen a focus of interest in the utilization of remote\nsensing data since the 1970s. Up until that time,\nweather satellites supplied daily images of entire con-\ntinents at low geometric resolution. With the launch\nof the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (later\nrenamed Landsat 1) in 1972 the era of environmen-\ntal and resource mapping began (Figure 7.1.2). The\nmultispectral scanner (MSS) on the Landsat series of\nsatellites provides ground resolution of 80 m in four\nspectral channels. Ten years later, on Landsat 4, it was\ncomplemented by the thematic mapper (TM) with a\nground resolution of 30 m in six spectral channels\n(plus a thermal channel with 120 m resolution).\n\nRussian systems, and later especially the French\nSPOT program, presented more possibilities to\nmonitor large parts of the Earth\u2019s surface from space\nat higher geometric and multispectral resolutions. At\nthe end of the 1990s, Indian, Chinese and increasingly\ncommercial satellite systems were added to this obser-\nvation fleet. Of the last, the German RapidEye system\nwith its five satellites should be mentioned; with its\n6.5 m geometric resolution it will set new standards\n(launched in 2008).\n\nThe applications for data coming from such systems,\nstarting with the Landsat satellites, include estimates of\nbiomass, both natural vegetation and agricultural\ncrops.

High geomet-\nric resolution is necessary for detailed recording of\nsmall-scale changes in agricultural areas or the growth\nof cities. For even more precise recording of vegeta-\ntion types and their condition, as well as geological\nstructures, better spectral resolution is called for. In\naddition to multispectral measuring equipment (with\nup to 12 channels), hyperspectral sensors with over\n200 spectral channels will be required in the future.\nThe German EnMAP satellite will meet this need\nstarting in 2012.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:525\n\n525\n\nMonitoring Geophysical Parameters\n\nWhen approaching Earth from outer space, one of\nthe first geophysical parameters one encounters and\ncan measure when still at a distance of hundreds of\nthousands of kilometers is its magnetic field. But Earth\nobservation satellites move in much lower orbits,\nwhere they are subject to a variety of other physical\ninfluences, including complex geomagnetic fields and\nradiation. Nevertheless, from this vantage point and\nwith simple radiation measuring equipment, the very\nfirst US satellite (Explorer 1, 1958) discovered the Van\nAllen radiation belt.\n\nSince that time, magnetometers to measure\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field have flown on a number of\nsatellites. At present (2009), three satellites, including\nGermany\u2019s CHAMP, carry magnetometers. With their\norbit geometry especially attuned to this task, the ESA\nSWARM mission should be able to measure the inner\nand outer components of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\nstarting from 2010.\n\nGravity is a critical field for global and regional\ngeophysical phenomena, including global climate\nindicators. Masses and mass transport in the Earth\u2019s\ncore and on its surface deform the so-called geoid, a\nmathematically determined surface which represents\nareas of equal gravitational force. One of the largest\nanomalies is to be found in southern India, where the\ndiscrepancy from a regular ellipsoid is about 110 m\n(see Figure 7.1.3).\n\nSince Earth-orbiting satellites orient themselves\naccording to the local gravity field, even small vari-\nations cause minimal changes in the satellite\u2019s orbit.\nVery precise measurement of the satellite orbit (orbit-\nography) is accordingly the key to calculating the\ngravity field. Measurement methods include, for\nexample, laser tracking, in which reflectors on the\nsatellite reflect back laser pulses sent from the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. A global network of satellite laser tracking\nstations (SLRs) carries out these measurements. But\nthe position and velocity of a satellite are also affected\nby numerous other influences which must be taken\ninto account \u2014 not least the remaining atmosphere,\neven at high altitudes. Besides laser tracking, micro-\nwave signals and GPS positioning are used for precise\norbit determination.\n\nConversely, precise knowledge of the gravity field\nis used to calculate satellite orbits.

But also changes in\nclimate, such as the El Nifio effect in the Pacific Ocean,\ncan be tracked down as differential changes in the\ngravity field. Thus evidence for their existence comes\nfrom the methodology of satellite geodesy.\n\nMapping the Land Surface\n\nThe conversion of images of the Earth\u2019s surface into\naccurate cartographic representations is the subject of\nphotogrammetry (also known as aerial photography\nsurveying). Driven by government planning and mili-\ntary requirements and supported by the evolution of\naircraft and improved camera technology and film\nmaterial, photogrammetry is a child of the early\ntwentieth century. At that time, analog images were\nturned into maps using a combination of optical and\nmechanical approaches. Stereo-optical images were\nused to calculate the heights of topographic features\nand other objects.\n\nThe first \u2014 including military \u2014 Earth surveying\nsystems from space also depended on analog came-\nras and subsequent photogrammetric interpretation\n(e.g., the metric camera on the 1983 shuttle mission).\nThe first civilian electronic systems had geometric\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nresolutions of 80 m (Landsat 1, 1972) and 30m\n(Landsat 4, 1982) and thus lacked the geometric\nprecision required for generating maps at smaller\nscales. This meant that structures such as streets\ncould not be recognized. Also, these instruments did\nnot allow stereo-optical oblique views of the Earth.\nThis situation changed with the launch of the French\nSPOT 1 satellite in 1986. Geometric resolution of\n10 m coupled with the ability to point the sensor\u2019s\nfield of view made it possible for the first time to\ngenerate three-dimensional topographic maps at\nsmall scales. In addition, analog photogrammetric\nmethods could be replaced by new digital algorithms\nand procedures. With the fall of the Iron Curtain\ngeometric resolution better than 10 m was possible for\ncivilian applications. Besides the first Russian data, the\nlaunch of the civilian US satellite IKONOS-2 in 1999\nmarked the beginning of a new era of high-resolution\noptical satellites with resolutions better than 1 m (see\nalso Table 7.1.2 below).\n\nThe sensors on these satellites are optimized\nfor the purpose of rapid mapping. High geomet-\nric resolution is in most cases achieved only in the\npanchromatic channel (black-and-white images). A\nfew other channels with lower geometric resolution\npermit false-color representations. When the data is\nused as the basis for maps, the precision of the at-\ntitude control of the sensor or satellite is important.\nComplex control systems usually permit both rapid\nand precise orientation of the entire satellite. Also,\nnumerous orbit- and attitude-regulating sensors as-\nsure the precise location of a pixel on the Earth, down\nto a few meters. Further improvements permitting\nextension down to the meter range and below can\nonly be achieved by making a connection with known\nterrestrial targets (\u201cground control points\u201d) such as\nstreet crossings. Rapid modification of a satellite\u2019s\norientation also makes it possible to record a given\nscene once again from another oblique angle and thus\nto have a stereo pair for three-dimensional analysis. If\ntwo cameras with different orientations are available\non-board one satellite, such stereo-optical images can\nbe regularly provided.\n\nBesides generating and updating topographic\nmaps, the spectral information provided by these\nsatellites makes detailed thematic mapping possible.\nIn the civilian realm, basic information for planning\n\n2/24/09 2:38:34 PM\n",

They are among the most important factors\nin day-to-day weather and long-term climate deve-\nlopment. Direct measurement of parameters for the\nstate of the ocean surface can only be provided for\nspecific locations because of the enormous distances\nand depths involved (anchoring of buoys). Therefore,\nEarth observation satellites can provide important\ninformation on these parameters. Satellite-based\nmeasurement methodologies for ocean parameters\ncover almost the entire range of applications currently\npossible with satellites.\n\nIn the optical range, narrow-band radiometers\nand spectrometers are used to map the ocean sur-\nface in several spectral channels. Pure water is only\n\u201cvisible\u201d in the wavelength range between 400 and\n750 nm. In this range, suspended matter (sediments),\nchlorophyll (plankton algae) and other organic and\ninorganic material can be recorded (Figure 7.1.5). In\nthe thermal range, sea surface temperatures (SSTs)\ncan be measured. When mapping oceans, global daily\ncoverage is usually desired. Optical sensors thus have\nbroad-swath widths and low geometric resolutions\n(1150 km at 300 or 1200 m resolution in 15 spectral\nchannels for MERIS on ENVISAT, for example).\n\nMERIS Water Constituents\n{or the Baltic Sea\n\nChlorophyll Concentration (mg/m\n\nFigure 7.1.5: Map showing chlorophyll concentration in the Baltic\nSea based on data from the MERIS sensor on the ENVISAT satellite\n(Source: ESA/DLR).\n\n2/24/09 2:38:36 PM\n",

Ocean currents (\u201cthe Gulf Stream\u201d) and surface\nwinds can also be measured with this technology.\n\nActive imaging radar sensors (synthetic aperture\nradar (SAR)) have been used since 1978 (US Seasat) to\nmap the ocean surface and polar ice. Since water acts\nlike a mirror for microwaves, regular wave patterns\ncan be traced in SAR images. These patterns enable\nconclusions to be drawn about wave height and direc-\ntion and the velocity of surface winds. Such analyses\nhave applications in the optimal sighting of off-shore\nwind farms or in detecting oil slicks (because of the\nattenuation of surface waves). Special reception modes\n(\u201cwind and wave mode\u201d) on the European satellites\nERS and ENVISAT can be employed to generate small\nsamples (\u201cimagettes\u201d) along the satellite track; taken\ntogether these permit regular ocean monitoring.\n\nSecurity and Military Applications\nMost of the systems, technologies and methodo-\nlogies of satellite cartography come from military\nprograms. The first photogrammetric cameras on\nsatellites flew on top-secret missions of the USA and\nformer USSR. On August 18, 1960 the first military\nreconnaissance mission of the USA, the Discoverer\n14 satellite, was launched. The exposed analog film\nwas ejected in a capsule which was captured in flight\nby dedicated aircraft. The geometric resolution was\n5-10 m. Because of the typically low orbits and the\nhigh consumption of film material, these missions had\na short life. The entire program, named CORONA,\nflew about 95 missions up to 1972. The concept of\nanalog film ejected in film capsules was replaced in\nthe mid-1970s by electronic systems. Meanwhile, the\n800 000 analog images have been digitized and made\navailable to the public.\n\nThe former Soviet Union also operated recon-\nnaissance satellites. ENIT-2, launched in 1962, even\nhad separate lenses to be able to record in six different\nspectral channels. The camera, built by Carl Zeiss in\nJena, recorded these channels on different films of\n70 mm width and 120 m length which were likewise\nejected in capsules.\n\nNaturally enough, there is no detailed informa-\ntion available about current military reconnaissance\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nsystems. Nevertheless, the latest generation of US\nreconnaissance satellites in the optical range is said\nto achieve geometric resolution below 10 cm. Using\ngeostationary data relay satellites these images are\navailable in real time and presumably also as video\nsequences. The technical design and size of these\nsatellites can be compared to the Hubble Space\nTelescope. With enough fuel on board, they can also\nchange their inclination and orbit height during their\nservice life, in order to reach given targets on Earth\nearlier or more frequently. The satellites operated by\nthe US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) go by\nnames such as Keyhole.\n\nBecause optical systems do not have all-weather\ncapabilities, security applications instead require\nactive radar systems (SAR), which can provide images\nboth at day and night in all sorts of weather. The\nUS military have a few such systems (\u201cLacrosse\u201d) in\noperation. The possibility of also using SAR to detect\nmoving objects gave rise to a classified US project to\nlaunch a fleet of SAR satellites into orbit in order to\nrecord in real time all moving objects on the Earth. At\npresent its realization is precluded by the enormous\ncosts involved and by the very large amounts of data\nwhich would have to be managed by the ground\nsegment.\n\nAsan effect of its development of the SPOT series of\nEarth observation satellites, France, as the only country\nin Europe, operates optical reconnaissance satellites\nwhich are only available to the military (Helios 1 and 2).\nHowever, cooperation agreements make the data\nalso available to other countries, including Germany,\nwhich launched a military SAR system (SAR-Lupe)\nat the end of 2006. By contrast, a \u201cdual-use\u201d system\nis represented by the Italian COSMO-SkyMed SAR\nsatellite, which was launched in 2007. The European\nfleet of Earth observation satellites is complemented\nby the French PLEIADES system with a geometric\nresolution of some 70 cm. It is available for military\nas well as civilian use.\n\nIn addition, both military and security authorities\nalso use data from civilian satellites to meet their\ninformation requirements. For that reason the US\ncommercial systems IKONOS and QUICKBIRD as\nwell as their successors GEOEYE and WORLDVIEW\nare primarily financed by customers from the military\nrealm.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:39 PM\n",
    "550": "7.1 Earth Observation\n\n7.1.2 Elements of Earth Observation\nMissions\n\nThe requirements placed on Earth observation missi-\nons come from users as well as systems considerations.\nA primary task during the definition and design phase\nof Earth observation missions is to balance both sets\nof requirements and develop a coordinated mission\nconcept.\n\nFor the user, these requirements relate in the\nfirst instance to subsequent applications for the\nmission\u2019s sensor data [7.1.2], whereas the concern\nof the systems side is technical realization of these\nrequirements, the satellite and its subsystems, the\nground segment and later on mission operation.\nThe requirements can be organized into four main\ngroups.\n\n7.1.2.1 Observation Profiles\n\nOften the user\u2019s interest in Earth observation data is in\nhaving access to observation areas of interest which\nmay be scattered over the Earth\u2019s entire surface. The\nuser\u2019s application usually focuses on monitoring large\nareas: for example, following the transformation into\nsteppes or growing desertification, monitoring the\nannual vegetation cycle, or keeping track of changes\nin the polar ice caps. But the user\u2019s interest may also\nfrequently be in having very detailed information\nabout selected small areas of the type to be found in\nurban settings, or in discrete objects such as airports,\nor even individual buildings. These requirements\ndirectly influence the mission profile, the design of\nthe orbit and sensing system, and the subsequent\ndata processing. Corresponding to this observation\nprofile, there are different requirements for the orbit,\nthe sensing instrument and the operations plan.\n\n7.1.2.2 Typical Orbits of Earth Observation\nSatellites\n\nIn general, geostationary as well as circular or even\nelliptical near-Earth orbits are suitable for Earth\nobservation missions. However, the latter are typically\nemployed for very specialized observation profiles\nsuch as reconnaissance missions.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:529\n\n529\n\nGeostationary Orbits\n\nThe geostationary orbit is used primarily for perma-\nnent and wide-area observation of the Earth\u2019s surface\nand its atmosphere for applications in meteorol-\nogy, climatology and environmental investigations.\nSatellites in this orbit are able to permanently monitor\na large part of the Earth. Three satellites equally spaced\nover the equator assure a permanent observation con-\nstellation for more than 90% of the Earth\u2019s surface.\nHowever, the polar regions cannot be included. With\nthe satellites\u2019 continuous observation capability and\ntheir fixed position with respect to the Earth\u2019s surface,\ndynamic processes in the atmosphere such as cloud\nformation, strong wind phenomena such as cyclones,\nand the movement of large masses such as desert\nsand can be well detected and monitored. Because of\nthe satellites\u2019 great distance from the Earth\u2019s surface,\nthe spatial resolution of optical sensors is limited\nto about 1 km, and relatively long sensor integration\ntimes are necessary. Typical representatives of this\nsatellite type are geostationary weather satellites such\nas Meteosat and GOES.\n\nLow Earth Circular Orbits\n\nThis orbit is primarily used for applications with\nmedium to very high geometric resolution of objects\non the Earth\u2019s surface. These satellites use a corridor\nof about 430-930 km altitude and orbit the Earth\nwith a period of 90-110 minutes, in other words\nbetween 13 and 15 times a day. The monitoring of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface is therefore not continuous as in\nthe case of geostationary satellites, but rather occurs\nin daily flights over the target area. The number of\noverpasses and thus the daily observation duration\nas well as the contact time with a ground station are\nlimited and depend on the geographical position.\nContact times are at most 15 minutes during a direct\noverpass. The preferred orientation for circular orbits\nis over the poles, because the Earth\u2019s rotation under\nthe satellite orbit plane makes it possible to sense the\nEarth\u2019s entire surface at regular intervals. An important\nspecial case of this orbit orientation is the so-called\nSun-synchronous orbit. With careful selection of\naltitude and inclination (approx. 98\u00b0), the precession\nof this orbit is equal to one rotation per year. Thus the\norientation of the orbit is always the same with respect\nto the Sun, which means that a location on the Earth\u2019s\n\n2/24/09 2:38:39 PM\n",
    "551": "CHO7.indd Sec1:530\n\n530\n\nsurface is flown over at the same local time each day,\nso the solar observation angle remains constant. The\nresult for optical satellites is comparable conditions of\nillumination for daily observation at the target loca-\ntion. Some radar satellites also use Sun-synchronous\norbits by flying along the border between day and\nnight (dusk\u2014-dawn orbits) and do not pass over the\nEarth\u2019s shadow. This makes it possible for their solar\ngenerators to be continuously illuminated by the Sun,\nwhich is beneficial for the charging of the batteries.\nHowever, the required high spatial resolution can\nonly be achieved by limiting the width of the sensor\nscan, the so-called swath width around the footprint\non the ground. Typical swath widths are 20-85 km\nfor land surface observation systems (SPOT, IRS,\nLandsat) and 10-21 km for systems with object-\ndetection capabilities (IKONOS, QUICKBIRD).\nBy lining up scanned swaths next to each other,\none can obtain a complete image of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface within one observation cycle. As to the\norbit path, for almost complete daily coverage a\nso-called floating orbit is necessary, which leads\nto continuous offsetting of subsequent footprints\non ensuing overpasses. By contrast, a frozen orbit\nproduces a daily integral repeat pattern. The\ntime interval required for complete coverage of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface is called the repeat cycle and\ndescribes the time that passes before a particular\nground track is repeated. It should be distinguished\nfrom the revisit time, which describes the time before\nsome location on Earth can be sensed again. Since\nthis time is a function of the geographic latitude of\nthe target area and the capabilities of modern satellite\nsystems to rotate up to 60\u00b0 from their nadir track, the\nrevisit time is always lower than the repeat cycle.\n\n7.1.2.3 Sensor Systems\n\nFor Earth observation, primarily optical sensors and\npassive and active microwave sensors are used. The\ngoal of the recording system is to achieve as far as\npossible an image of the Earth with moderate to very\nhigh spatial resolution. For both sensor systems the\ncurrently preferred resolution range for civilian Earth\nobservation satellites is between 5 and 30 m for large-\narea monitoring (Landsat, SPOT, ERS, ENVISAT,\nRADARSAT-1), as well as the range between 0.5 and\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\n3m for detailed imaging (QUICKBIRD, IKONOS,\nTerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2). Typically, both types\nof sensors offer different sensing modes. These can\nproduce either a continuous, \u201cstrip map\u201d or a selec-\ntive, scene-oriented recording. For the latter, a \u201clook\nand stare\u201d or \u201cspotlight\u201d mode is frequently used, in\nwhich the sensor limits its scan onto the target area\nby mechanical or electronic means in order to obtain\nan acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nBoth optical and microwave sensors provide\ntechnical means for measuring the topography of\nthe Earth. Whereas optical sensors follow the classic\nstereo method of using fore- and aft-looking cameras\nor different satellite passes for sensing from different\nobservation positions, radar sensors primarily use\ninterferometric methods with two receivers at dif-\nferent locations or with two overpasses of the same\nreceiver in a multipass procedure.\n\nOptical Sensor Systems\n\nThe classic optical multispectral recording processes\nuse either mechanical scanning (Landsat) or elec-\ntronic line scanners with one to five rows (MOMS).\nMultispectral scanners usually employ 4-7 spectral\nbands in the visual and thermal wavelength range\n(Landsat 7) selected according to the desired applica-\ntion (Table 7.1.1).\n\nFrequently, a panchromatic sensor (0.45-0.90 jum)\nwith significantly higher geometric resolution is added\nto sharpen the multispectral image (IKONOS, SPOT).\nFor modern optical systems the radiometric resolution\nis 10-12 bits and permits object recognition even in\nshaded areas.

As\nimaging sensors, linear CCD rows with over 12 000\npixels are used.\n\nOptical sensing systems (Figure 7.1.6) with very\nhigh, so-called hyperspectral resolution of 200 or\nmore spectral bands have so far only been employed\nto monitor the atmosphere (GOME, TOMS, SCIA-\nMACHY). As they are used primarily to measure the\nconcentration of trace gases in the atmosphere, their\nmoderate geometric resolution (40-200 km) is ade-\nquate. The value of this type of sensor for land surface\nor ocean applications is, however, evident. Progress\nin technical developments will soon support their\napplication in spaceborne systems (EnMAP).\n\nInfrared sensors are being integrated in mul-\ntispectral and hyperspectral instruments. The spec-\ntral ranges of reflective (3.7-5.4 um) and emissive\n(12.3-15.4 ym) infrared are of particular interest.\nThe TM on Landsat 4/5 was equipped with spectral\nchannels in these infrared ranges and the planned\nsensor suite for the hyperspectral EnMAP satellite\nwill likewise be equipped with several channels in\nthe infrared range. Another special application of\ninfrared sensors is recognizing hotspots like forest\nand bush fires, volcanic eruptions and disasters at\ntechnical facilities (Chernobyl).

They are\naccordingly preferred for monitoring areas of the\nEarth which are cloud covered (as in the tropics)\nor do not receive sunlight (polar regions) for a high\nproportion of the year. Because of the need to send out\ntheir own illumination signal to the target area, active\nradar sensors using an SAR approach are technically\nmore elaborate than optical sensors, and are thus\nusually limited to one radar frequency range. This\ndisadvantage is partially compensated by the multiple\npolarization capability which is increasingly being\nused in new sensors, as well as in formation flights of\nsatellites bearing radar sensors of different frequency\nranges. Such formations were originally planned for\nthe TerraSAR-X (Figure 7.1.7) and TanDEM-X mis-\nsions and will presumably be realized with the Italian\nX-band mission COSMO-SkyMed and the Argentine\nL-band mission SAOCOM. Because of the different\nabsorptive characteristics of the microwave radiation,\nthe frequency ranges of L-band (2 GHz; TerraSAR-L,\nSAOCOM) for vegetation monitoring applications,\nC-band (5 GHz; ERS, RADARSAT, ENVISAT) for\nice and ocean monitoring, and X-band (9 GHz; Ter-\nraSAR-X, COSMO) for purposes of high-resolution\nobject detection are preferred. Radar sensors usually\nemploy active array antennas with a large number\n(384 modules in the case of TerraSAR-X) of transmit\nand receive modules as emitters, or concentrating\nreflector dishes.\n\nFigure 7.1.7: TerraSAR-X satellite in flight configuration (Source:\nASTRIUM).\n\n2/24/09 2:38:40 PM\n",

For this purpose, ESA has approved the\nADM-AEOLUS mission [7.1.7].\n\n7.1.2.4 On-board Data Handling\n\nModern Earth observation sensors generate data at\nrates and volumes which place extremely high demands\non handling and transmission of the data to ground.\nPeak data rates of several gigabits per second are no\nexception for modern Earth observation sensors and\ncannot as such be transmitted directly to ground, since\nthe required transmission bandwidth is not available\ndue to international regulations. Compression of the\nraw sensor data and interim storage in so-called solid-\nstate mass memories (SSMMs) on-board the satellite\nare therefore essential. Frequently, data processing\nalso includes encryption for the purpose of security\nfrom unauthorized access. The transmission of data\nfrom satellite to ground takes place in the dedicated\ntransmission band (X-band, 8.025\u20148.4 GHz) at the\ncurrent maximum data rate of 320 Mbit/s. The availa-\nble bandwidth is sufficient for data transmission from\nmost Earth observation satellites today. Future systems\nwill, however, require new transmission technologies,\nsuch as bandwidth-optimized modulation schemes,\nmultiple polarizations, a switchover to new transmis-\nsion bands, and the transfer of data via geostationary\ncommunications satellites at very high-frequency\ntransmission (Ka-)bands or via optical transmission\nlinks (e.g. Laser Communication Terminal).\n\n7.1.2.5 Payload Ground Segment\n\nThe logical connection between the sensor system\non-board Earth observation satellites and the users of\nthe sensor data on the ground is the so-called payload\nground segment. It comprises all the functions and\nservices necessary to supply the users with the informa-\ntion they desire and to make it possible for them to put\nit to the intended use. These functions include order\nplacement by the user as well as mission planning and\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nsensor tasking, data reception, processing, archiving,\nand distribution of information to the user.\n\nThe technical structure of a payload ground\nsegment is quite different from that of the flight or\nmission operation segment, which is responsible\nfor the satellite platform, mission planning and sensor\noperation. There are, however, numerous interfaces\nbetween both facilities at the level of mission planning\nand operation. The technical elements have much\nin common, as do the terrestrial communications,\nground stations, databases and archives; the main\ndifferences are in the techniques used to handle the\ndata rates and volumes from the sensor. These are\nfrequently several orders of magnitude larger than\nis the case for the mission operations. Transmission\nrates of several hundred megabits per second are today\nthe state of the art and will grow in future by another\nfactor of 10. This is the reason for differences in the\ntechnical design of the payload ground segment,\nwhich is oriented toward the provision of user services,\ndata sets and information products. These functions\nand services are making data access in near real time\nincreasingly possible and have the goal of generating\ninput products for geophysical and Earth-related ana-\nlyses. Another consideration is that in many cases new\nphysical insights can only arise from completely new\nreprocessing of data sets which incorporate long time\nintervals of monitoring. The most obvious example is\nthe discovery of the ozone hole over the south polar\natmosphere, which, although detected in the first data\nfrom the CCSZ sensor on-board the Nimbus satellites,\nwas only recognized after complete reprocessing of the\ndata with new algorithms.\n\nThe establishment of a payload ground segment\nis a significant step in realizing an Earth observation\ncapacity, since timely data availability and long-time\ncontinuity of data archiving are primary preconditions\nfor exploiting satellite-supported Earth observation\nactivities. This is true for applications of immedi-\nate interest, like provision of information during\ncatastrophes, as well as for evaluating data revealing\nlong-term changes in vegetation or urban landscapes,\nfor example. Thus the preservation and maintenance\nof large data archives from various data sources is a\ncentral task of payload ground segments, a task which\nhas been jointly carried out in Europe for a number of\nyears by several data centers in collaboration with ESA.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:41 PM\n",

It incorpo-\n\nrates the following services:\n\ne Processing to value-added levels.\n\ne Archiving and cataloging the received raw data\nand derived information products.\n\ne Order management and distribution of the reque-\nsted Earth observation products to users.\n\ne Online access via the Internet to existing data\nsets as well as to request the recording of new\ndata sets.\n\ne Monitoring and control processes, which ordina-\nrily operate automatically and reliably.\n\nData Libraries\n\nThe heart of a payload ground segment is its archiving\nand cataloging system. It stores all received raw data\nand derived value-added products for long-term pre-\nservation, manages this data and provides easy access\nto catalog information and data sets. The catalog\ninformation, which describes each individual product,\nis managed in databases to enable efficient searches\nand rapid access to millions of separate information\nitems. The image information, by contrast, is stored\n\n2/24/09 2:38:42 PM\n",

This staged\nprocedure assures that there are no delays in near-\nreal-time access when the magnetic tapes are accessed\n(Figure 7.1.10).\n\nProcessing\n\nProcessing systems are used within the payload\nground segment to convert raw data to value-added\ninformation products. Depending on the instrument\n(SAR, multispectral or hyperspectral sensor) and the\ndesired processing level, specific processing algorithms\nare used on the assigned computer platforms. These\nso-called (sensor) processors are integrated in the\ninformation technology environment of the multi-\nmission ground segment via modules which assure\nthe uniform and harmonized management of the pro-\ncessors. Different categories of processing sequences\nregulate the data flow in the ground segment. Thus\nin the ingestion processing sequence the raw data\nfrom in-house or external ground stations is recorded\nand associated metadata extracted as required by the\narchive, for example by determining image corner\ncoordinates, extent of cloud cover, or by deriving typi-\ncal processing parameters such as the pulse repetition\nfrequency (PRF) of the SAR sensor. Independently,\nsystematic data-driven processing sequences for\nindividual data sets can be automatically converted\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:535\n\n535\n\nwithout external request into end products by means\nof predefined parameters, or archived data sets cove-\nring several years can be reprocessed on the basis of\nnew algorithms, or refreshed at defined intervals by\nbeing copied onto new media. These systematic data\nflows can be contrasted with user-driven processing\nsequences. Here, individual requests for data reception\nare initiated and customized information products\ngenerated. Figure 7.1.11 is an orthogonal depiction\nof the horizontal data-driven and the vertical user-\ndriven data flows.\n\nUser Information Services\n\nAnother important function of the ground segment is\nproviding online access services for users. It permits\naccess to the product and data catalog and to sup-\nporting functions (guides), usually via a Web portal.\nSearches, coupled with visualization elements, provide\neasy access to browse images, to detailed parameters\nor permit the transfer of entire scenes. At the same\ntime the order management system initiates the order\nand delivery process and confirms ordering rights and\nuser profiles.\n\nProduct Distribution\n\nThe distribution of data and information products\nto a wide range of users (from individual scientists\nto organizations which operate their own service and\ndistribution facilities) reflects the variety of require-\nments which must be met by the data distribution\nsystem. Depending on the data volume and specified\ndelivery time, data sets can be copied onto various\ntypes of media (CD, DVD, magnetic tapes or disks)\nfor delivery. Complex distribution services allow\nthe supply of individual products, product bundles\nfrom various missions, or even mass supply of data\nsets covering several years of monitoring. The distri-\nbution of data sets in near real time via terrestrial or\nsatellite-supported networks is gaining in importance,\nespecially for civil protection purposes and in catastro-\nphic situations. The establishment of near-real-time\ndelivery mechanisms as well as the generation of user-\nspecific \u201cpostprocessing\u201d products, such as time series,\nmosaics and geoinformation in an OGC-compatible\nformat, are the goals driving current developments in\ndata distribution services.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:46 PM\n",

At the same time people\nexhibited a growing desire for a large number of tele-\nvision programs, so that satellites rapidly replaced the\nexisting terrestrial transmitters and cable facilities and\ntheir quite limited numbers of program channels.\n\nIn addition to communications and television\nbroadcasting, global satellite position determination\nwas an application directly derived from the first arti-\nficial satellite, Sputnik 1, and led to the global satellite\npositioning systems of Zykade (Soviet Union/Russia)\nand Transit (USA) with Doppler measurements. Since\n\n2/24/09 2:38:50 PM\n",
    "560": "7.2, Communications\n\nthen, one-way ranging technology has been employed\n(see Section 7.3).\n\n7.2.1 The Beginning \u2014 Sputnik\n\nUntil 1963 satellite technology was exclusively a secre-\ntive military matter, in both the Soviet Union and the\nUSA. Then President John F. Kennedy ordered in the\nCommunications Act of 1963 that it be employed for\nthe benefit and welfare of humankind (an idea ancho-\nred in the US Constitution, which nobly declares an\ninalienable right to the \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d).\n\nIn contrast to the usual political rhetoric, where\nthings may be promised but left unrealized, President\nKennedy ensured that his Act was implemented. He\nfounded COMSAT and commanded that an internati-\nonal operating agency be established and charged with\noffering satellite communications worldwide, also to\nthose nations not yet able to pay for it. There was a\nclear aim to found a company which would arrange\nfor the establishment of this international operator.\n\n7.2.1.1 The Entry - COMSAT\n\nFounded in 1963, the commercial company Com-\nmunications Satellite Corporation, Washington, DC,\nreceived initial financing of $300 million from the US\ngovernment. With this, it was able, within 10 years, to\nestablish the independent International Telecommuni-\ncations Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT); it continues\nto offer communication services at reasonable cost\nworldwide. It is also a company listed on the stock\nexchange, and it is the world\u2019s largest satellite operator\nin terms of number of satellites in orbit (53 operational\nspacecraft in 2008).\n\n7.2.1.2 Mobile Communications \u2014 MARISAT\n\nIn 1973, COMSAT took the second step and establis-\nhed maritime satellite communications. The first\nMARISAT satellite was launched 30 months after\nthe program started, and in 1976 the worldwide\nMARISAT satellite system for maritime communi-\ncations was put into operation. For its international\noperations, COMSAT then established a second inter-\nnational consortium, the International Maritime\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:539\n\n539\n\na TT&C antennas\n\n7 UHF antennas\n200/300 MHz\n\nj\u2014\u2014 L-band antennas\n1.5/1.6 GHz\na\n\n\u00ab {\u2014 C-band antennas\n\na\n\n4/6 GHz\n\n;\u2014\u2014 Sun sensor\n\nFigure 7.2.1: The MARISAT satellite with its UHF and L-band\nantennas on a spin-stabilized cylindrical body (the axis of rotation\nis parallel to the Earth\u2019s axis) and despun Earth-oriented antenna\n(Source: COMSAT).\n\nSatellite Organization (INMARSAT, London). In\n1983, INMARSAT took over the satellites and their\noperation from COMSAT, a task it continues to carry\nout independently and successfully today. It has since\nincluded aeronautical and especially terrestrial mobile\ncommunications.\n\nFigure 7.2.1 shows the MARISAT satellite, a spin-\nstabilized satellite (the axis of rotation is parallel to the\nEarth\u2019s axis) with a despun Earth-oriented antenna.\n\n7.2.1.3 The National MOLNIYA Program\n\nDuring this time the Soviet Union achieved optimal\ncoverage of its vast territory extending over 11 time\nzones with its nongeostationary MOLNIYA satellites.\nThese satellites also served \u201cbrother\u201d nations such as\nCuba, North Vietnam, the GDR, etc. The disadvan-\ntage of these satellites, namely that numerous ground\nantennas must track the satellites 24 hours a day, was\nnot trivial, since, besides those run by the state, there\nwere few private ground stations. This satellite system\nwas, despite the founding of the INTERSPUTNIK\norganization in Moscow and its mandate to offer\nsatellite transmission free of charge to communist\n\u201cbrother\u201d nations, scarcely of any use for the civilian\npopulation, quite contrary to the humanitarian call\nof John F. Kennedy.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:50 PM\n",
    "561": "CHO7.indd Sec1:540\n\n540\n\nIn contrast to INTELSAT, INTERSPUTNIK did\nnot own any satellites but was allocated commu-\nnication capacity according to need by the Soviet\ngovernment \u2014 some 300 telephone circuits worldwide\nin 1990 (compared to 300 000 telephone circuits and\nover 100 television channels for INTELSAT).\n\nLater, the GORIZONT fleet of geostationary\nsatellites was built up with greater capacity (in the\nC-band). This introduced a transition from global\nsystems to regional and national satellite telecom-\nmunications networks.\n\n7.2.1.4 National Satellite Networks\n\nOne of the first national civil networks, besides the\nmilitary networks of the USA and the Soviet Union,\nwas established in 1976 in Indonesia (a country of\n14 000 islands), and almost simultaneously in Canada\nwith the ANIK system (extending over 5000 km of\nthe sparsely settled northern part of the American\ncontinent).\n\nAt that time, ARABSAT started broadcasts for\nthe Arab language area, offering also telephony and\ntelevision services.\n\nThen, gradually, national systems were set up,\nfirst in the USA. The RCA SATCOM had the most\nmodern satellites of the time, also serving Alaska.\nOther regional systems followed for particular zones\nof interest. The EUTELSAT (European Telecommuni-\ncations Satellite Organization) was created to supply\ncoverage in Europe.\n\nIt should be emphasized that at a time in which\nnational terrestrial telephone systems were still ana-\nlog and thus of limited transmission capacity (with\ndata rates of 64 kbit/s at most) these satellite system\noffered megabits per second services between, say,\nScandinavia and the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe failure of the German television satellite\nTV-Sat provided the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Satellits\n(SES, Luxembourg) with an opportunity to offer pan-\nEuropean television coverage with the ASTRA system,\na service which EUTELSAT joined later. Today it is\ndifficult to imagine life in Europe without satellite\ntelevision transmission.\n\nNext to television, Europe-wide satellite radio\nbroadcast is growing, starting with the WORLDSPACE\nsystem. Radio, in contrast to television, is of course\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nmuch more determined by regional cultural interests:\none is more likely to view a Hollywood film than, say,\nlisten to Portuguese songs in Scandinavia, or vice\nversa. The essential attribute of satellites, to be able\nto serve large areas, is not demanded here; the radio\nstations with the most local appeal for listeners appear\nto be the most successful.\n\n7.2.2 Satellite Communication\nServices\n\nWorldwide, there are over 100 satellite operators in the\ncommunications business offering telephone services\nand data transmission, mobile telephony, television\nand radio [7.2.1], specifically in the fields of:\n\ne Fixed satellite services (FSS)\n\ne Mobile satellite services (MSS)\n\ne Broadcast satellite services (BSS).\n\nThese three categories, out of a total of 20 satellite\ntransmission services (see Table 6.3.2), are the most\nprofitable.\n\nSince the beginning of commercial space flight in\n1965 with Intelsat 1, the vast majority of satellites fly\nin geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) (see Section 2.2).\nThe official designation for this orbit is the geostatio-\nnary orbit (GSO), and for all other orbits the nonge-\nostationary orbit (NGSO).\n\nOriented toward the Earth\n\nOriented toward the Sun\n\nFigure 7.2.2: A communications satellite containing three flywheels\nto stabilize its position in the three coordinate axes [7.2.3].\n\n2/24/09 2:38:51 PM\n",
    "562": "7.2, Communications\n\nThese satellites have their antennas oriented tow-\nard the Earth while they are orbiting, but their solar\npanels always need to be oriented perpendicular to\nthe Sun in order to receive the maximal amount of\nsolar energy (see Figure 7.2.2). For this purpose they\nare mounted on the z-axis so that they can rotate\naround their axis once a day relative to the body of the\nsatellite (the satellite\u2019s z-axis is parallel to the Earth\u2019s\naxis). The electrical power generated is transferred to\nthe satellite body via slip-ring bearing and the power\ntransfer assembly (BAPTA).\n\nThe antennas have to be aligned with the target\narea with a precision of 0.1\u00b0 (and in the future the\nprecision specification will be even more stringent as\nantenna sizes and particularly frequencies increase).\n\n7.2.2.1 MOLNIYA Satellites and Orbits\n\nThe exception to the rule that commercially successful\nsatellite systems fly in GEO are the Russian MOLNIYA\nsatellites. In order to serve this massive country, at least\nthree GEO satellites are required (with only two, the\nnorth-central region would lack coverage). The highly\nelliptically orbiting MOLNIYA satellites (they bear\nthe same name as their orbits and the rockets used to\nlaunch them) fly in a relatively stable orbit inclined\n63.43\u00b0 relative to the equatorial plane. The MOLNIYA\norbits are so designed that the satellites stay over Russia\nfor a long time (apogee), with only a short flight over\nthe South Pole (perigee). Over northern Siberia, the\nMOINIYA satellites offer an almost vertical view angle\n(instead of a grazing angle in the case of GEO satellites,\nif they can be seen at all).\n\nA MOLNIYA orbit is used for satellite-supported\npay radio in the USA, the SIRIUS system. In a 24-hour\norbit with only two satellites, one is always over the\nUSA during its long time close to apogee.\n\n7.2.2.2 Local Services and the Last Mile\n\nOther national satellites are used occasionally in the\nUSA for very local applications, such as for vacationers\nin isolated national parks so they do not have to do\nwithout the Internet there.\n\nThe most exotic topological, but nevertheless very\nup-to-date application for geostationary satellites (who-\nse essential attribute is coverage of almost half of the\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:541\n\n541\n\nEarth) is the link for the last mile from the street cabinet\nin the neighborhood to the home. Particularly in North\nAmerica, where this last mile can be much longer and\nwith users today expecting gigabit per second services, a\nsatellite connection is faster to install and less expensive\nthan a cable connection for this bit rate [7.2.4].\n\n7.2.3 Low-Orbit Spacecraft\n\nSatellites flying in low Earth orbit (LEO) were never\nused commercially, even in the early days of space\ntechnology. The reasons are that a large number of\nsatellites are needed to achieve geographical coverage,\nand at each ground station two to three antennas\nare necessary to provide uninterrupted service (one\nantenna tracks the descending satellite, e.g., in the west;\nthe second looks toward the ascending satellite in the\neast, while a third is \u201cscanning\u201d the sky for a more sui-\ntable satellite, possibly at a higher altitude, less blocked\nby buildings or with more free capacity).\n\nThe supposition that launch into low Earth orbit\nis less expensive is a fallacy. Placing satellites into\norbit at the geostationary altitude of 36 000 km\nabove the equator has not been an obstacle ever since\nHarold Rosen of the Hughes Aircraft Company, USA,\ndeveloped the apogee kick motor (AKM) and the\nassociated launch procedure in 1965 and successfully\ndemonstrated them with Intelsat 1. With the AKM\nit is possible to put satellites into GEO with rockets\nlimited to LEO. The satellite\u2019s internal propulsion\nsystem, even today, remains the most efficient method\nof taking a satellite to GEO altitude. It competes with\ntransport via GEO-capable rockets, which have the\nsubstantial disadvantage that they themselves remain\nin the geostationary orbit where they could collide\nwith satellites.\n\nWhereas communications satellites fly as high as\npossible, preferably in geostationary orbits, so that\nthey can serve the largest possible region (42.6% of\nthe Earth), Earth observation and reconnaissance\nsatellites fly in low orbits to maximize the resolution of\ntheir imagery. An exception to this rule was proposed\nduring the Cold War as an answer to the question of\nhow to make a (military) satellite invulnerable. One\nsingle satellite cannot be made invulnerable, but many\nsatellites can be launched and operated so that it is\n\n2/24/09 2:38:52 PM\n",

After 1990, the number of satellites was\nreduced to only 77, later to 66, still a large number,\nparticularly since the requirement of invincibility of\nthe fleet was no longer a systems requirement.\n\nNevertheless, the Iridium, Globalstar and Orb-\nComm communications systems were realized. They\njoined the intermediate altitude circular orbit (ICO)\ndefined by INMARSAT. All four companies predic-\ntably went bankrupt in 2000, from which Iridium,\nGlobalstar and OrbComm recovered with the help\nof US government contracts. The commercial success\nof low-flying communications satellites has not been\nproven to date.\n\nFigure 7.2.3 shows the footprints of the Iridium\nsatellite constellation of low-flying satellites. Iridium\nflies in a polar orbit at an altitude of 790 km and has\nits highest satellite density at the Earth\u2019s poles. Over\nthe world\u2019s most heavily populated areas at about\n45\u00b0N latitude, only a single satellite is in view (whose\nfailure leads to service outage).\n\nFigure 7.2.4 shows the footprints of the Globalstar\nconstellation of orbiting satellites. In contrast to Iridi-\num, the Globalstar satellites fly at 1414 km altitude in\ninclined orbits and have their highest concentration\nover the latitudes of the Earth\u2019s population. Here up\nto four satellites are in view, so that the failure of any\none of them will not interrupt service.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of satellites\nin GEO and LEO are summarized below based on\nvarious considerations.\n\nLaunch Cost: About 50% of the cost of launch\ninto GEO arises during the first 10 km. The higher\nunit cost for a GEO is outweighed by the large\nnumber of satellites necessary in LEO. Low orbits\nhave no advantage over geostationary orbits as to\ntheir energy balance.\n\nTransmit Power: Recalling the law of the conser-\nvation of energy, the power received on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface is independent of the flight altitude from which\nit is transmitted. So LEO offers no signal advantage\ncompared to GEO.\n\nFigure 7.2.4: The footprints of the Globalstar satellites.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:52 PM\n",

This argument was not\nalways correct either. For satellites having on-board\nsignal processing, there can be latencies as high as the\ntime required for the signal to reach GEO because of\nthe processing time.\nFor broadcasting services (television) low orbiting\nsatellites are totally inappropriate because the users\u2019\nantennas would have to track those satellites 24 hours\na day.\n\nIn the case of other services, particularly Earth\nobservation and reconnaissance, only a small number\nof ground stations are operated and it is desirable to\nfly as low as possible. But such services do not require\nglobal 24-hour coverage; these satellites fly frequently\nbut not continuously over a particular target area.\n\nToday, communications services have to be glo-\nbally and continuously available to be successful in\nthe market. If low orbits are selected, then a large\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:543\n\nNumber of satellites \u2014\n\nnumber of satellites have to be launched and operated.\nFigure 7.2.5 shows the number of satellites required\nfor a given minimum elevation between the user and\nthe satellite as a function of the altitude of the satellite\n(see also Section 2.2).\n\nThe Figure illustrates, for example, the case when a\nsatellite flies at an altitude of only 700 km with a user\nrequiring a minimum elevation angle of at least 40\u00b0 so\nthat there is a good chance of seeing the satellite also\nin urban environments. This leads to a requirement\nfor 840 satellites, the original TeleDesic system, which\ncould not be financed.\n\nThe horizontal bars in Figure 7.2.5 represent the\ninner and outer Van Allen radiation belts, which\nshould be avoided for technical reasons related to\non-board electronic equipment. Reasonable flight\naltitudes are under 2000 km (the LEOs), between\n6000 and 10 000 km (the ICOs) and above the outer\nVan Allen belt (such as at 20 000 km for navigation\nsatellites).\n\n7.2.4 Satellites in Medium-Altitude\nOrbits\n\nThe need to reduce the large number of satellites\nrequired for the LEO systems led to the proposal of\nsystems with constellations in ICOs proposed by ICO\nInc. and TRW Corp. (the Odyssey system). The ICOs\nare about 10 000 km high (instead of 700 to 1400 km\n\n2/24/09 2:38:56 PM\n",

With two orbital planes of\nfive satellites each, or three planes with three satellites\neach, global coverage is achieved, including the Earth\u2019s\npoles. The time for the signal to travel forth and back is\nalmost negligible at 70 ms (assuming that no on-board\nsignal processing takes place in the satellites).\n\nBut as in the case of the LEO, the user antennas,\ninstead of remaining stationary, have to constantly\ntrack the orbiting satellites, with the additional expense\nof a second antenna per terminal pointed toward the\nascending satellite while the first one operates with\nthe descending satellite, for (almost) uninterrupted\nservice.\n\nAn additional requirement is signal handover from\nthe descending to the ascending satellite, several times\na day, with the smallest possible loss.\n\nFor general communication services and particu-\nlarly for the broadcast of television programs, ICO\norbits are not suitable.\n\n7.2.5 Satellites in High Orbits\n\nIn higher orbits, twice the height of ICOs, satellites are\nalso moving in circular medium-altitude Earth orbits\n(MEOs). The GPS/NAVSTAR system of the US armed\nforces and the GLONASS system of the Russian armed\nforces both fly at 20 000 km altitude, and Europe\u2019s\nGalileo at about 24 000 km [7.2.5].\n\nAt this flight altitude the diameter of the ground\ncell subtended by the satellite is about 20 000 km, just\nless than 40% of the Earth\u2019s surface. A minimum total\nof six satellites would thus suffice to have at least one\nof them always available for every point on Earth.\nWith 18 satellites at least three would always be in\nsight, so that triangulation could be carried out to\ndetermine position.\n\nThere are no known projects for communication\nsystems in MEO. Such systems would have the same\ndifficulties relating to the need for tracking with at\nleast two antennas per ground station, including the\nhandover of the signal, as described for the LEO and\nICO orbits [7.2.6].\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\n7.2.6 Satellites in Highly Inclined\nOrbits\n\nThe highly inclined elliptical orbits (HEOs) (often\nincorrectly interpreted as highly elliptical orbits)\nare in principle suitable for communications, the\nmost well-known examples being the MOLNIYAs\nmentioned above for telephony and data (Russia,\nsince 1965) and the SIRIUS system for radio/music\n(USA, since 2000).\n\nThe high inclination permits coverage of regions\nin the high north (see Figure 7.2.6); in culmination,\nMOLNIYA sees not only the North Pole, but also the\nother side of the Earth down to New York.\n\nThe 63.43\u00b0 inclination guarantees a stable orbit\nwith minimal requirements for operational adjust-\nment. With a 24-hour orbit, two satellites equally\ndistributed in orbit are sufficient for one of them to\nalways be over the target area.\n\nHEOs can be operated for any orbital period.\nWith a 12-hour orbit, two northern culminations\nwould be achieved. Global HEO constellations with,\nfor example, three culmination points over Europe,\nthe USA and Japan/China (see Figure 7.2.7) could\npresumably serve 90% of the Earth\u2019s population.\nThe operator of communication services based on\n\nFigure 7.2.6: The elevation angle eto a satellite in HEO including\nnorthern latitudes.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:56 PM\n",

The\noperator would also have to set up and operate service\norganizations in these regions, something that could\nnot easily be done against the will of the established\ntelecommunications organizations there, some of\nwhich are still state owned.\n\n7.2.7 Satellites in Inclined,\nGeostationary Orbits\n\nAn orbit only conditionally suitable but nevertheless\nvery promising for communications is the inclined\ngeosynchronous orbit (IGSO).\n\nGeosynchronicity means that in IGSO the duration\nof one orbit is 23 hours, 54 minutes and 6 seconds (the\nsidereal day) so that the satellite always remains at the\nsame longitude.\n\nInclination refers to the fact that the IGSO orbital\nplane is inclined with respect to the equatorial plane;\nover the course of a day a satellite in this rotating\ninclined orbital plane travels north-south relative to\nthe Earth (just as someone on a rotating tipped ride\nat an amusement park goes up and down relative to\nthe solid ground).\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:545\n\n545\n\nThe length of the north-south movement amounts\nto twice the value of the inclination. IGSOs with a\nslight inclination are a common occurrence in geo-\nstationary Earth orbits: the asymmetrical attraction\nof the Moon relative to the equatorial plane, which\naffects a satellite in geostationary orbit, shifts its orbit\nfrom the horizontal plane and inclines it by 0.8\u00b0 per\nyear while maintaining the orbital period.\n\nUncorrected, the satellite would gradually incre-\nase its inclination up to a maximum of 17.5\u00b0. At this\ninclination the satellite would see the Earth\u2019s poles\nonce daily, long enough for a communication link\nwith research stations there.\n\nTo cover northern regions at large angles of inci-\ndence, IGSOs have to achieve higher inclinations; the\nsatellites are then not launched from equatorial bases\n(such as Kourou, less than 5\u00b0 latitude) but rather from\nnorthern sites (such as Plesetsk, at about 63.43\u00b0N).\n\nWith three or more satellites in IGSO, one of them\nis always in the northern culmination. If the longitude\nof the IGSO is in Europe, the satellites fly over Central\nEurope and provide users there with an almost vertical\nelevation angle, in contrast to an elevation angle under\n30\u00b0 which Central Europeans have with a GEO. This\nis an important precondition for communications in\ngeneral, especially in urban environments.\n\nThese advantageous elevation angles and the\nregional attribute of IGSO led to the selection of\nIGSO in the original Galileo system planning, with\nthe goal of beginning the system implementation in\nEurope. A European IGSO would not have flown over\nthe USA; there were fears that the USA would not\ntolerate a foreign competitive system. Also, European\ncoverage was considered preferable to worldwide\nexpansion, especially for mobile land applications\nin Europe, which account for over 90% of the utili-\nzation of a satellite positioning system.\n\nThe extension of Europe\u2019s Galileo to achieve inter-\nnational coverage with IGSOs over the Americas\nand Asia was intended, should these regions join\nthe system and participate financially. In this way a\nglobal system could have been built up step by step,\nwith international cooperation and participation,\nincluding especially the USA.\n\nSimulations also showed that an IGSO con-\nstellation would be more effective than an MEO\nconstellation; with the same number of satellites it\n\n2/24/09 2:38:57 PM\n",
    "567": "CHO7.indd Sec1:546\n\n546\n\nachieves better coverage, or it requires fewer satellites\nfor the same coverage. Nonetheless, MEO technology\nwas selected for Galileo for political reasons, so the\nsystem is not sovereign; it can be degraded or turned\noff by the USA whenever and wherever it considers\nthis to be necessary, with the explicit permission of\nthe EU.\n\nThe value of IGSO for communications is in the\nhigh elevation angles, in northern regions as well,\nwhich permits communication also in urban high-rise\nenvironments with no visibility to GEO satellites. Even\nmore relevant is the characteristic of IGSO to be able\nto reuse the frequency spectrum employed in GEO\nwithout causing mutual interference. The frequencies\nused there can be reused in the northern culmination\nand once again in the southern IGSO culmination, a\ntripling of the usable spectrum; the orbital commu-\nnications capacity is tripled with IGSO.\n\nThis characteristic outweighs all other points of\nview. The available spectrum in GEO is so extensively\nused today that it is almost impossible to obtain licen-\nses for and operate any more geostationary satellites\nto supply the Earth\u2019s highly populated areas.\n\nThere are presently about 500 commercial commu-\nnications satellites in GEO in active operation or with\nlegal licenses to operate. In addition, there are military\ncommunications satellites and satellites providing\nweather services, used for civilian Earth observation\nor employed in military reconnaissance.\n\nFor higher data rates, Internet downloads and\nbroadband video from unmanned flight drones, all\nof which are transmitted to the control centers via\ngeostationary satellites, larger ground antennas are\nrequired.\n\nCompared to GEO satellites, satellites in IGSO\nhave to operate with ground antennas which are either\nsmall enough for the satellite to be in the antenna\u2019s\nmain beam, or have larger apertures, which must be\ndynamically tracked. However, in the latter case a\nsingle antenna is sufficient for each ground terminal\n(in contrast to the three antennas required for LEOs).\nSince the ascending and descending satellites are at\nthe same longitude, they meet at the point of signal\ntransfer and a simple handover at this location is\npossible.\n\nToday, modern antenna designs are available for\nantennas with large apertures whose beams can track\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nsatellites. Instead of parabolic dishes of sheet metal,\nan arrangement of patches is used, which can be\ncontrolled in amplitude and phase so that they gene-\nrate a beam in the target direction, and this without\nemploying any mechanically moving parts; these are\nthe so-called phased array antennas.\n\nThe directivity and thus the antenna gain, which\nare important for the transmission, are identical for\nphased array antennas of the same size as parabolic\ndishes operating at the same frequency. Since the pha-\nsed array antenna consists of semiconductor elements,\nit has the potential for significant cost reductions\nwhen produced in sufficient quantities.\n\n7.2.8 Polar Orbiting Satellites\n\nSatellites in orbits crossing over the poles are suitable\nfor Earth observation, not because of their view of the\npoles, but because polar Earth orbits (PEOs) can be so\ndesigned that after a few orbits the satellite repeats its\ntrack; it flies with the same Sun angle so that new image\nmaterial can be compared with previously recorded\nimages without misleading shadows.\n\nFor communication services (stationary or mobile\ntelecommunications and television), polar Earth orbits\nare unsuitable and economically undesirable because\nthey produce the highest satellite density (and thus\nsystems costs) at the poles where there are no custo-\nmers. In contrast the satellite density is relative low,\nwhere the higher user density (population density) is\nlocated on the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\n7.2.9 Platforms in the Stratosphere\n\nLong before space activities began, high-flying plat-\nforms were used for communications and especially\nfor television broadcasts (Ohio, USA, 1955). Today,\nthere are still special applications, so a glance at\nthese stratospheric satellites is appropriate. The\nradiofrequency regulations today provide frequency\nallocations for communication with high-altitude\nplatforms (HAPs).\n\nAircraft and zeppelins are used as high-altitude\nplatforms, less so balloons, which, unlike aircraft\nand zeppelins, cannot be maintained in a stationary\n\n2/24/09 2:38:58 PM\n",
    "568": "7.2, Communications\n\nposition against the forces of the jet streams which\ndominate the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe advantage of aircraft is their ability to easily\nmaintain their position against jet streams, an essential\nprecondition for communications services. In addi-\ntion, they can be brought back down regularly and at\nshort notice for servicing and refueling.\n\nThe advantage of zeppelins is that they can main-\ntain altitude without fuel, but they too have to resist\nthe jet streams. The use of fuel is almost impossible\nfor this purpose, since it would be too costly to bring\nit up to the vehicle, or to bring the zeppelin back down\nto Earth for refueling.\n\nPerhaps there will be, one day, affordable batteries\nto store enough electrical power during sunshine to\nmaintain the zeppelin\u2019s position during nighttime.\n\nTo cover an area the size of Germany, an altitude\nof about 20 000 m, which is above the airspace used by\naircraft, is necessary and adequate. For the coverage of\nlarger regions a fleet of several zeppelins would have\nto be in operation simultaneously.\n\nIn any case, an HAP in the stratosphere would have\nto precisely maintain its position also during the night,\nto allow communication at high bit rates, and thus with\nlarge, fixed, directive, nontracking ground antennas.\n\nIf these preconditions are met, then HAPs are\nplatforms of choice for communications, which are\nprimarily regional (one calls more often someone in\nthe same county than someone on the other side of the\nglobe). Precisely this user profile can be well served with\nHAPs, which would free satellites from this service.\n\n7.2.10 Telecommunication Services:\nLittle-Big\u2014Mega\n\nIn the context of satellite communications, the voca-\nbulary little, big, super and mega is used; what does\nthat mean [7.2.7]?\n\n7.2.10.1 Little Services\n\nServices with low and very low data rates (short mes-\nsage services) are also known as little services (little\nLEO services). These satellites typically fly in circular\ninclined orbits at low elevation (LEO) and store data\non-board, which is demodulated so that the addresses\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:547\n\n547\n\ncan be read. When flying over the addressee the data\nis then sent down. Alternatively, with many of these\nlittle LEO services users can themselves download\ntheir data from the satellite storage system.\n\nEven when the satellites deposit the message data\nimmediately after identifying the address, transmis-\nsion is not synchronous, so it is not suitable for voice\ntraffic but only for data. In addition, the frequency\nbands used in the UHF range are so overloaded by\nvarious services that it can take up to 15 minutes\nbefore the user terminal can deposit a message; there\nis no real-time capability.\n\nBesides the little LEOs for the little services, small\namounts of data can also be transferred via geostati-\nonary satellite systems like EUTELSAT (EutelTracks,\nin the Ku-band) and via INMARSAT (Standard C\nand Standard D, in L-band) inexpensively, reliably\nand without delays.\n\n7.2.10.2 Big Services\n\nThis type of service differs from the little services in\nthe bit rate; big services (big LEO services) can also\ntransmit voice and data at ISDN speed. The term is,\nhowever, restricted to low-flying satellites; the geo-\nstationary communication satellites have of course\nalways been used to transmit voice and data.\n\nThe two most well-known big LEO systems are\nGlobalstar and Iridium, with Iridium also operating\nlittle LEO services. The latter is a packet-switched\nnetwork suitable for transmitting even the smallest\ndata units, whereas Globalstar is circuit switched. For\nthis, it would not be economical to set up a circuit\nonly to use half of it, the connection from A to B, to\n\ntransmit a single unit of data.\n\n7.2.10.3 Super Services\n\nIn addition to the standard telephone services via\ngeostationary satellites and the big LEO services,\nthe term \u201csuper services\u201d is used for telephone via\ngeostationary satellites using cell phones. This super\nservice was successfully introduced in 2000 with the\ngeostationary Thuraya satellites, simultaneously with\nthe bankruptcy of the big LEO systems Globalstar and\nIridium. In the meantime INMARSAT also offered a\nsuper service.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:59 PM\n",
    "569": "CHO7.indd Sec1:548\n\n548\n\n7.2.10.4 Mega Services\n\nOn the scale from little (lowest bit rates) to big and\nsuper (data rates allowing voice communication),\nmega is next, leading to bit rates in the megabit per\nsecond range. For this service it was also proposed to\nuse low orbiting satellites: TeleDesic (TeleDesic Inc.),\nCelestri (Motorola Corp.) and SkyBridge (Alcatel\nEspace).\n\nTeleDesic promised the user transmission rates of\nup to 1.5 Gbit/s. For this purpose, 840 satellites, later\nreduced to \u201conly\u201d 288, were to fly in circular LEOs.\nSince bit rates of this order of magnitude require the\noperation of directional ground antennas with large\napertures, the users would have had to operate at least\ntwo (tracking) antennas, at considerable investment\nand operating expense.\n\nNone of these mega LEO systems was realized.\nMega services via geostationary satellites continue\nto be offered and operated in all communication\nsatellite systems.\n\n7.2.11 Transponders\n\nTypical transmission bandwidths are 1 GHz (500 MHz\nin each of the two polarizations; 4.2 GHz in the case\nof ASTRA), not reflected in an extremely wide band,\nbut subdivided into frequency units of, for example,\n40 MHz, which are processed separately. The repe-\nater, which converts a 40 MHz band unit into the\ndesired frequency and transmits it amplified back\nto Earth, is called a transponder (it transposes the\nfrequency it receives to the transmit frequency).\n\nThis subdividing of the actively used spectrum\nin transponders was necessary in the early days of\nsatellite technology because the transmit power which\nwould be necessary to emit the entire bandwidth was\nnot technically available. Even today, when this satellite\ntransmit power is technically available, transponders\ntaking up only part of a bandwidth are used because\nthey can flexibly serve individual antennas for given\ncoverage zones (something that would not be possible\nfor an en bloc converter). Satellites which transmit in\nthe C-, Ku- and Ka-bands with a total of 100 trans-\nponders are state of the art.\n\nAlso state of the art are flexible payloads \u2014 flexible\nas to bandwidth, power and service region on Earth.\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\n7.2.11.1 Variable Transponder Transmission\nPower\n\nIf one desires to change the transmit power of a\ntransponder during flight without modifying the\npower output of the transmitter amplifier, the easiest\nmethod is to provide additional amplifiers: transpon-\nders which potentially have requirements for higher\npower are connected to additional amplifiers (parallel\nconnection). This can be accomplished in orbit from\nthe ground as required.\n\nParalleling of transmit amplifiers goes back to the\nfirst communications satellites Intelsat I and Intelsat\nII. The 6 W amplifiers available in 1964, which could\nonly serve single carrier operation in Intelsat I, led to\na single transponder on Intelsat II with four of these\namplifiers, allowing multiple carrier operation with\nsome six ground stations in six countries, in the USA\nand in Europe.\n\nThe manufacturer of these satellites continued\nto produce parallel connections of amplifiers in the\nsatellites up until today \u2014 a small expense with great\nbenefits because, should amplifiers fail on the satellite,\nthe amplifiers intended for the parallel connection\ncould be used to maintain operation. A transponder\nwith only one amplifier is more useful than a trans-\nponder without an amplifier.\n\n7.2.11.2 Multimode Tubes\n\nThe second possibility to achieve variable transponder\ntransmit power is to construct the amplifier so that it\ncan be operated in two or three different output stages.\nWhile any amplifier can be operated with low output\npower by starting with low input power, it will require\nfor such operation the same power supply it would\nrequire if operated to full capacity.\n\nA bi- or tri-mode amplifier can be operated at\ntwo or three output stages, in which only one-half,\none-third or two-thirds of the full power supply is\nrequired.\n\nThe use of tri-mode amplifiers can be traced back\nto MARISAT, the first mobile communications satel-\nlites, in 1976. Starting with a slowly growing number\nof customers and an inefficient use of the fill factor of\nthe satellite, the MARISAT program leased capacity\nto the US government. This contract included the\nunique demand for lessening transmission capacity\n\n2/24/09 2:38:59 PM\n",
    "570": "7.2, Communications\n\nover time. In the first phase the capacity for the US\ngovernment was 90% of the total, and the transponder\nfor commercial radio service to ships and on land was\nkept to 10%. Later, the capacity for the government was\nreduced to 70% and commercial broadcasts increased\nto 30% etc. This achieved a smooth ramp-up of a new\nservice for the commercial sector, unique in the history\nof communications satellites.\n\nEfficient bi-mode and tri-mode traveling wave\ntube amplifiers are also produced in Europe and are\ntoday a component of modern satellite payloads.\n\n7.2.11.3 Variable Transponder Bandwidth\n\nWith the use of digital bandpass filters it is possible\nto change the transponder bandwidth in orbit during\nmission operation. In the ideal situation where all\n40 MHz transponders are equally used to capacity,\nit is not used in practice. There always are, however,\ntransponders which are not used to capacity and\nothers for which there is more traffic than they can\ntransport.\n\nWith transponders whose bandwidth can be chan-\nged in orbit, the actual traffic load can be matched.\nNo transponder is operated with unused bandwidth\nwhich picks up noise, and no traffic is rejected because\na transponder is already being used to capacity.\n\nThe additional power required by a transponder\nwhose bandwidth was increased can be supplied\nby transmit amplifiers connected in parallel, or by\nusing multimode amplifiers. In the same way, power\nis reduced in transponders whose bandwidth was\nreduced in keeping with the traffic load.\n\n7.2.11.4 Smart Antennas\n\nHand in hand with adjustable transponder band-\nwidths and transmit power go antennas which can\nbe reconfigured in orbit (smart antennas). For a\ncommunications satellite, quite often the traffic profile\nchanges during the mission, especially for missions\nlasting 15 to 20 years, a duration which is technically\npossible today and is used.\n\nEven for a moderate mission life of 10 years this\ncan be the case. One example is DFS-Kopernikus in\nGermany, whose antennas had been customized for\ncoverage of the Federal Republic in the 1980s and\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:549\n\n549\n\nFigure 7.2.8: The planar phased array antenna which can also be\nconformably shaped and simultaneously receive from and transmit\nto several satellites.\n\nthen was unable to provide services to the formerly\nEast German states after reunification.\n\nSimple circular or elliptical service regions can be\ngenerated with circular or elliptical satellite antennas.\nOften the topological requirements are more likely to\nbe irregular, if not geographically bizarre. To meet such\nrequirements, suitable satellite antennas are required,\nand there are at least three designs available.\n\nQuite common are passive reflectors in whose\nfocus there is an arrangement of active feed elements\nwhich can be controlled from any service region on\nthe ground.\n\nPhased array antennas (Figure 7.2.8) are flown on\nGlobalstar and Iridium, among other platforms.\n\nIntelligent antennas are also irreplaceable on the\nground, for example on vehicles: a thin-foil phased\narray is installed to conform to a car roof and dyna-\nmically tracks several satellites without affecting the\nCy value of the vehicle. To track several satellites\nwith parabolic antennas, several antennas would be\nrequired, and these could not be mounted on cars,\nmuch less on aircraft.\n\n7.2.11.5 Nulling Satellite Antennas\n\nCommercial communications satellites are incre-\nasingly subject to unintentional interference, and\nmilitary communications satellites have always been\nprotected against intentional interference. The pha-\nsed array antennas (see Section 7.2.11.4), in addition\nto the ability to produce customized, oddly shaped\nfootprints on the ground, can also counteract one or\n\n2/24/09 2:38:59 PM\n",

The reason is the same in both cases: the\nfrequency bandwidth of one cell can be reused in the\ncell after the next one. This frequency reuse is absolu-\ntely required to accommodate continually increasing\ncommunications traffic in a physically limited, not\nincreasing frequency spectrum.\n\nIf one-third of the entire bandwidth is allocated\nto each cell in a honeycomb structure and n cells are\noperated, then the net usable frequency band increases\nby a factor of n/3. With 200 cells on INMARSAT-4\nthis leads to 67 MHz of usable bandwidth per 1 MHz\nof spectrum.\n\n7.2.11.7 On-board Processing and Switching\n\nParticularly for satellite payloads serving multiple cells\non the ground, the problem of switching traffic between\nthese cells arises. To provide links within the cell as well\nas with any one of the n \u2014 1 other cells requires 17/2\nconnections. In conventional technologies this require-\nment would lead to the installation of n\u00b0 transponders\n(for each connection two transponders are required,\none from A to B and one from B back to A).\n\nFor example, in the case of n= 200 cells, this would\nrequire the installation and operation of n\u00b0 = 40 000\ntransponders, which is practically impossible. Instead,\none employs a processor in the payload, the on-board\nprocessor (OBP), which takes over this switching\nfunction (on-board switching, OBS).\n\nThe control of the switch can take place either\non-board or on the ground (the ground network\ncontrolling commands the on-board processor). In\nthe first case, the processor must demodulate the\nsignal in order to be able to read the desired address\nin its baseband. This is technically possible today and\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nsaves time and transmission capacity; the signal can be\nforwarded directly to the addressee, whereas with\nground control the signal has to travel from the sender\nvia the satellite to the ground station and after the\nswitching then back via satellite to the addressee.\n\nDemodulation of the signal in the satellite has the\nadditional advantage that signal errors incurred on the\nuplink can be corrected on-board, so that the signal\nemitted on the downlink is \u201clike new,\u201d free of errors.\n\nThe signal can also undergo another modulation in\nthe satellite to optimize it for the downlink, something\nquite common in military spacecraft.\n\nIn addition to the dramatic advantage of the\non-board processor of not having to install, say,\n40 000 transponders, the operation of this processor\nhas systems benefits.\n\nWhen a ground cell in a transponder architecture\nhas little traffic or remains altogether unused, neither\nits bandwidth nor its power can be transferred to\nanother cell (another transponder) which might be\noverloaded and must reject additional traffic.\n\nBy contrast, the on-board switching handles all\ntraffic, no matter how heterogeneously distributed\nover the cells, flexibly assigning bandwidth and power\nto cells needing it, in real time and without rejecting\nany traffic.\n\n7.2.11.8 Payloads with Multiple Frequency\nBands\n\nOf the frequency bands listed in Section 6.4.2 allocated\nto satellite communications, the P-, L, S-, C-, X-, Ku-,\nKa-, Q-, V- and W-bands, current national communi-\ncations satellites commonly use four, namely the C-,\nKu- and Ka-bands, in commercial communication: the\nKu-band for broadcasting, the X- and Ka-bands for\nmilitary telecommunications, and the L- and S-bands\nfor mobile communications.\n\nCross-connections between these bands (cross-\nstrappings) in the payload usually assure technical\nflexibility. At least the P-band with its limited band-\nwidth will be cross-connected, to link the anchor\nstation in the Ku- or Ka-band with the satellite (feeder\nlink) and operate with the user in the P-band, with\nits narrow range of voice channels.\n\n2/24/09 2:38:59 PM\n",
    "572": "7.2, Communications\n\n7.2.12 Transmission Techniques\n\nSatellite communications use the same modulation\nprocedures as do terrestrial communications, prefe-\nrably phase shift keying modulation with 4 (QPSK)\nand 16 (APSK) phase states.\n\nThe QPSK modulation (M= 4 with 2 bits/symbol)\nrequires 0.8 Hz/bit of bandwidth: that is, 1 Mbyte/s\nrequires 0.8 MHz bandwidth; the 16APSK procedure\n(M = 16 with 4 bits/symbol) requires 0.4 MHz per\n1 Mbyte/s, including rate 3/4 trellis coding and a\nguard band between carriers. The state of the art is\nthat modulation equipment adjusts the degree of\nmodulation to the quality of the channel in the course\nof transmission (DVB-S2 Standard, Self-Adjusting\nModulation Techniques). As long as the transmission\nchannel maintains nominal quality, the modems\nmodulate 16APSK; if channel quality breaks, for ex-\nample because of the weather, the modem reduces the\ndegree of modulation, such as to QPSK. This makes\nthe transmission twice as robust, although only half\nas fast, but it is better to have error-free transmission\nthan rapid but faulty transmission.\n\nAlso for channel coding, equipment with adaptive\ncode rates is used today in satellite communications,\nas it has been used terrestrially since the 1970s. If the\nchannel degrades and the bit error rate increases, the\ncoder/decoder reduces the code rate from, for example,\n3/4 (every fourth bit is a code bit) to 1/2 (every second\nbit is a code bit). In this way the error rate is reduced\nat the cost of a slower transmission.\n\nThe third way to maintain transmission despite\ndifficult channel conditions, next to reducing the\nmodulation and increasing the coding, is to reduce\nthe carrier load in the satellite transponder (load\ndumping). If the situation requires it, a few carriers\nwill be temporarily offloaded and their power assigned\nto the remaining carriers in the transponder so that\nthey, now equipped with higher transmit power, have\na better chance of maintaining nominal quality (threat\nadaptive offloading).\n\nOne could also use the bandwidth freed by offloa-\nding for increased channel coding of the remaining\ncarriers, thus making them even more robust, and\nthereby achieve additional error protection.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:551\n\n551\n\n7.2.13 Multiple Access Techniques\n\nHow can many users gain access to a single resource,\nthe communications satellite? An obvious answer is:\none after the other (successive multiple access, called\ntime division multiple access (TDMA)). But users\ncould also work with different frequencies at the same\ntime, in the same way that radio stations transmit\non their own individual frequencies (multiple access\nby subdividing a frequency range, called frequency\ndivision multiple access (FDMA)). A third option is\nto individually code multiple transmissions so that\nthey can be superimposed on the same frequency\n(multiple access via coding, called code division\nmultiple access (CDMA)). Knowing the selected\ncode, the recipient can filter out, from the sum of\nall signals, the one meant for him or her. CDMA is\ncostly in terms of bandwidth.\n\nTDMA is currently the method of choice by far;\nit achieves the highest satellite throughput for a given\nfrequency band and power.\n\n7.2.14 Frequency Ranges in the\nElectromagnetic Spectrum\n\nThe frequency spectrum officially allocated to satellite\ncommunications in the range from 7 kHz to 1000 GHz\nis increasingly utilized, presently up to some 100 GHz.\nBesides the technology available at such frequencies,\npropagation in the atmosphere is a limiting factor for\nthe highest frequency.\n\nIt is interesting to note that propagation in the\natmosphere does not become increasingly difficult\nas frequencies exceed 100 GHz. Attenuation by pre-\ncipitation more or less stagnates there, so that one\ncan also work in the infrared and visible ranges. The\ngreat advantage there is that laser links enable much\nlarger bandwidths, so a far greater volume of data\nper unit time can be transmitted. And for the satellite\ntechnology it is especially advantageous that laser\nlinks require considerably less electrical power per\ntransferred bit.\n\nThese giga-size transmissions at laser frequencies\nare possible with relatively small antennas (they are\n\n2/24/09 2:39:00 PM\n",
    "573": "CHO7.indd Sec1:552\n\n552\n\ncalled telescopes here), another systems advantage.\nHowever, these small telescopes have an extremely\nsharp focus \u2014 they hit a point on the Earth with an\naperture of 1/1000\u00b0, which translates to a diameter\non the ground of about 300 m, not even the area of\nan urban district.\n\nThere are two ways to reach users distributed\nthroughout an urban district or across even larger\nregions: either with terrestrial networks, in which\nthe gigabit link is received by one anchor station and\nforwarded terrestrially to the target address, or by\nusing a satellite phased array antenna, which can\nreceive a large number of laser links from distributed\nstations and then retransmit them. The first phased\narray antennas in the laser frequency range have\nalready appeared. They have to form a sufficiently\nlarge number of beams to be able to serve a large\nuser group, since each laser link typically serves only\none user. The first large-broadband laser links (at\nwavelengths of 1.55 pm) from GEO to Earth have\nbeen in operation for several years, and from LEO to\nEarth for 30 years. The further development of this\ntechnology for satellite communication will progress\nrapidly. Major steps have been taken in just the last\nfew years in the direction of:\n\ne Significantly more powerful emitters\n\ne Coherent modulation\n\ne Capability to maintain operations while looking\ninto the Sun.\n\nIn the USA 40 Gbit/s transmissions have successfully\nbeen demonstrated (1 Gbit is the entire contents of the\nEncyclopedia Britannica including tables and figures).\nEven a small number of such links correspond to a\nbandwidth which in the electromagnetic spectrum\nbetween 1 and 100 GHz is not physically available.\n\n7.2.15 Disposal of Satellites\n\nA severe problem associated with space activities is\ndisposing of satellites at the end of their service life.\nThis is significant because satellites are becoming so\ncommonplace. Whereas LEO satellites are slowed\ndown over time by the residual atmosphere that exists\nup to about 500 km altitude, and then eventually burn\nup as they enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere proper, ICO and\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nGEO satellites remain in orbit for a long time at the\nend of their service life, where they not only block an\norbit position for their successors, but in the worst\ncase could collide with other satellites.\n\nThe frequent practice of raising GEO satellites toa\n\u201cgraveyard orbit\u201d higher than GEO has for a long time\nnot been considered a viable solution, because more\nand more satellites are colliding also in this orbit, and\nhalf of the ensuing debris is hitting satellites in GEO.\nReturning satellites to Earth after their mission life\nwill have to become standard procedure; the sooner,\nthe better.\n\n7.2.16 Outlook\n\nOver the last 40 years, satellite communications have\nbeen the money-earning workhorse of space activities,\nand this will surely continue to be the case for at least\nthe next 40 years. Wernher von Braun once remarked\nthat if all other space activities were to receive a budget\namounting to some 5% of the turnover of satellite\ncommunications, then space activities would continue\nto prosper; this hope has so far been fulfilled.\n\nFixed satellite communication will continue to\nbe irreplaceable wherever broadband transmissions\nhave to be established rapidly and flexibly, including\ndisassembly after a period of time. Also, thin route\ntraffic will not be replaced by optical fiber technology\nfor a long time.\n\nRadio and television broadcasting will for a long\ntime into the future be more economical via satellite\nthan via terrestrial transmitters or cable networks.\nTerrestrial transmitters in Germany alone cost over\nDM200 million per year in 1985, more than the cost\nof a satellite which can broadcast 100 television pro-\ngrams for 15 years. And the satellite can serve all of\nEurope, certainly 100% of Germany, something that\nthe terrestrial transmitters cannot accomplish with\ntheir coverage of less than 95% of the country.\n\nMobile telecommunications over large areas for\nsurface vehicles, ships and aircraft, reliably and with\nadequate bit rates, cannot be accomplished terrestri-\nally; nobody will ever lay a fiber optic cable of any bit\nrate to an aircraft.\n\nFor this purpose the first satellites with 40 m x\n40 m antennas (ET-5) have been put into orbit; fast\n\n2/24/09 2:39:00 PM\n",

The continuous\navailability of this information enables new services and\napplications to significantly contribute toward econo-\nmic growth, for example by increasing the efficiency of\ntransport and logistics. The fundamentals of satellite\nnavigation and future developments are outlined in\nthis section.\n\n7.3.1 Basic Principles of Satellite\nNavigation\n\n7.3.1.1 History of Navigation\n\nIn 1519 when Magellan set sail on his journey around\nthe world, he was equipped with sea charts, globes,\nwooden and metallic theodolites, quadrants, com-\npasses, magnetic needles, timepieces and \u201ca log towed\nastern.\u201d With these tools and with many years of expe-\nrience it was possible to determine the speed of the\nvessel, its direction and latitude [7.3.1]. An accurate\ndetermination of longitude during voyages off-\nshore was made possible only about 250 years later\nby the development of sufficiently accurate clocks.\nFor example, during a two-week voyage, using a clock\nwith a time accuracy of 1 PPM would result in a time\nerror of more than 1 second, which at locations near\nthe equator causes a positional error of more than\n500 meters. In 1761 John Harrison received a prize\noffered by the British Parliament for the off-shore\ndetermination of longitude. This prize was awarded\nfor his pendulum clock No. 4, which kept time accu-\nrately within only 5 seconds during an 81-day voyage.\nThe astronomical determination of longitude based\non time measurement using a clock on-board the\nvessel became obsolete only through the develop-\nment of telegraphy and radio technology at the end\nof the nineteenth century. During the period from\nthe fifteenth up to the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury, navigational requirements provided the\n\n2/24/09 2:39:00 PM\n",

Today\nglobal navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology\nis very frequently used for time synchronization over\nlarge distances, for example, for telecommunications\npurposes.\n\nSince antiquity sailors near the coast had used bea-\ncons! and charts on which their positions were registered.\nThe identification of the individual beacons was made\nfrom their periodically coded light signals. Determining\nposition at sea resulted from triangulation. Encoding\nand accurate knowledge of the location of signal sources\nas well as triangulation and/or trilateration are also the\nbasis for determining location by means of the long-\nrange navigation (LORAN) system and GNSS. The\nencoding of the transmitters corresponds to the CDMA.\n(Code Division Multiple Access) technology used today\nfor distinguishing different GPS satellites.\n\nThree technological disciplines have determi-\nned navigation methodology over the course of the\ncenturies:\n\ne Geodesy and charts\ne Time measurement\ne Astronomy, and today space technology.\n\nGeodesy and Cartography: The basis for any type\nof navigation is utilization of a uniform reference\nsystem and representation of the Earth\u2019s surface in\ncharts. In the course of the nineteenth century the\nincreasing accuracy of geodetic measurements revealed\nthat a representation of the world as a sphere or as an\nellipsoid is not sufficiently accurate. With the scientific\ndiscovery of continental drift and the mobility of the\nEarth\u2019s surface, which could be measured for the first\ntime in the 1950s, the assumption of a rigid Earth\nsurface also had to be given up.\n\nTime Measurement: The development of highly\naccurate atomic clocks with a time stability error of\nless than 2 ns per day was indispensable for measuring\nsignal propagation time with sufficient accuracy. Today\ncesium or rubidium atomic clocks are used on-board\nnavigation satellites. For the Galileo system it is planned\nto use even more accurate hydrogen masers.\n\n! The Colossus of Rhodes (~280BC) and The Pharos of\nAlexandria (~250BC) are well-known beacons of antiquity.\nToday lighthouses are still in operation to warn of dangerous\nlocations and/or coastal regions or in cases when other\nnavigational means are faulty or unavailable.\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nSpace Technology: In order to be able to transmit\nthe timing signals from an accurately known position\nin orbit, the orbital motion of the satellite must be\nhighly stable and predictable. Decades of experience\nin space flight technology allow prediction several\ndays in advance with an accuracy of a few meters in\nthe orbital motion of navigation satellites, which have\nan orbital speed of 3.9 km/s.\n\n7.3.1.2 Origin of Satellite Navigation - TRANSIT\n\nTRANSIT (also known as NAVSAT) was the first\nsatellite navigation system and the predecessor of GPS.\nIts transmission frequency was tuned to be 150 and\n400 MHz. Starting from 1958, TRANSIT was develo-\nped by the US Navy. It was put into service for the first\ntime in 1964 and after 1967 it was also used for civilian\npurposes [7.3.2]. The TRANSIT satellite system was\ndecommissioned on December 31, 1996.\n\nTRANSIT was the first-ever functioning satellite\nnavigation system. It was originally developed for\ncommanding the ballistic missiles of the US Navy.\nAn accurate missile guidance system was urgently\nrequested at that time, mainly for the nuclear weapons\non submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nThe achievable accuracy depended upon recei-\nver technology and amounted to between 500 and\n15 meters. Under normal operating conditions, the\nTRANSIT system required at least four functional\nsatellites. In the final phase of TRANSIT operation the\nconstellation consisted of six satellites: three operati-\nonal satellites and three used as a backup system. The\nTRANSIT satellites used polar orbits with an altitude\nof approximately 1220 km.\n\nThe use of four ground stations, which transmitted\ncorrection data every 12 hours to the satellites, was\nnecessary. The TRANSIT system was controlled by\nthe Naval Astronautics Group (NAG) in Point Mugu,\nCalifornia.\n\n7.3.1.3 Functional Principle of Satellite\nNavigation\n\nToday navigation with satellite signals is performed\nwith a so-called trilateration procedure, which allows\nthe calculation of the unknown three-dimensional\ncoordinate by measuring distances to transmitters at\n\n2/24/09 2:39:01 PM\n",

The transmitters\nare on-board satellites with precisely determined orbits\nwhich are transmitted to the users by the navigation\nmessage. The determination of the distance between\nuser and satellites is made by measuring the signal pro-\npagation time from the satellite to the user. The satellite\nand receiver clocks must be accurately synchronized\nfor the propagation time measurement since the signal\npropagates at the speed of light, about 0.3 m per 1 ns.\nOn-board the satellites are highly accurate atomic\nclocks whose time variances are closely monitored and\nmodeled to achieve the required accuracy. Since such\nprecise clocks would be very expensive and unpractical\nin users\u2019 receivers, the receiver time is synchronized by\nthe signal of a fourth satellite (Figure 7.3.1).\n\nFor this reason at least four satellite signals are\nnecessary to determine a three-dimensional coor-\ndinate (x, y, z) and the local time t. The signals are\ntransmitted from the satellite\u2019s position x), y,\n2\u201d.

Such\na system provides capacity for any number of users\nwithout the need to adapt the system. In addition,\nit is desirable for military applications that the user\ndoes not radiate any signal which could reveal his or\nher position. Due to progress in clock technology,\naround 1970 the decision was made that satellites\nshould broadcast a time synchronous signal and\nthat the trilateration principle be used instead of a\nDoppler or hyperbolic positioning method.\n\ne Due to the general progress in signal processing\ntechnology, continuous transmission of CDMA\nsignals was chosen for GPS, since it was considered\nto be superior to pulsed or FDMA (Frequency\nDivision Multiple Access) signals.\n\ne For the carrier frequencies the choice fell on\nL-band frequencies (1-2 GHz) because of their\nrelative insensitivity to tropospheric weather influ-\nences, the moderate propagation dependence on\nionospheric conditions and the availability of a\nsufficiently large frequency spectrum (approx.\n20 MHz per signal) in the 1970s.\n\nFor the design of the segments, the following basic\nconsiderations were taken into account.\n\nSpace Segment\nNavigation satellites send their signals to Earth from\naccurately known orbital positions. The core elements\nof each navigation satellite are highly accurate atomic\nclocks, from which the highly stable carrier frequency\nis derived, and signal generators, which modulate the\ncarrier frequency with the navigation message and\nthe time signal.\n\nThe space segment consists of a constellation of\nsatellites, so that users have as frequently as possible\nat least four satellites in direct line of sight. The choice\n\n2/24/09 2:39:01 PM\n",
    "577": "CHO7.indd Sec1:556\n\n556\n\nof orbits for a navigation satellite constellation is\ndetermined by the following considerations.\n\nLEO (Low Earth Orbit) constellations with an\norbital altitude < 2000 km provide satellite visibility\nof less than 20 minutes and due to the large orbital ve-\nlocity the signals show a strong Doppler shift. For global\ncoverage with at least four visible navigation satellites,\na constellation with more than 100 satellites would be\nrequired. The advantages of a LEO constellation would\nbe the moderate launch costs per satellite, and the fact\nthat the signals could be broadcast with relatively low\npower density. On the other hand, orbital disturbances\ncaused by atmospheric friction would be large.\n\nMEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites with orbital\naltitudes around 20 000 km and a period of approx.\n12 hours have a visibility of several hours for users\non the Earth\u2019s surface, which significantly reduces\nthe number of signal reacquisitions compared to\nLEO satellite signals. The launch costs are higher,\nbut 24-36 satellites per constellation are sufficient to\nachieve worldwide navigation coverage. The satellite\norbits are more stable, but cosmic radiation affecting\nsatellite components is significantly higher, which\nlimits in particular the life cycle of key components\n(atomic clock, signal generator).\n\nGEO (Geostationary Orbit) satellites with an\norbital altitude of approx. 36 000 km remain at a fixed\nhorizontal position and for worldwide coverage only\nfew satellites are required. But due to the equatorial\nposition of the GEO satellites, the geometrical distri-\nbution would deteriorate the achievable navigation\naccuracy and at higher latitudes satellite visibility\nwould be easily blocked by buildings, trees, etc.\n\nFor today\u2019s navigation constellations (GPS and\nGLONASS) and also for Galileo, MEO satellite orbits\nwere selected. For augmentation systems (e.g., WAAS,\nEGNOS, MSAS) GEO satellites are preferred [7.3.5].\nA combination of GEO and MEO satellites is planned\nfor the Chinese COMPASS system.\n\nFurthermore, Japan is planning to launch a mini-\nconstellation consisting of three satellites in HEO\norbits (highly inclined elliptical orbits) to be used as\nan augmentation system.\n\nGround Segment\nThe ground segment comprises all terrestrial com-\nponents which are required to operate the complete\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nnavigation system and to ensure its reliability and\nthe quality of the broadcast signals. This includes\nthe control centers (ground control center (GCC))\nas well as a number of remote sites and an associated\ncommunication network between the remote sites\nand the control centers.\n\nThe ground segment is divided into a ground\ncontrol segment (GCS) and a ground mission segment\n(GMS).\n\nThe GCS is used to command the satellite fleet\nfor both routine and special operations, such as com-\nmissioning the satellites (launch and early operation\n(LEOP) and in-orbit testing (IOT)). The command\nand control signals are generated by the GCS equip-\nment in the GCC and are transmitted over a dedicated\ncommunications network to the telemetry, tracking\nand control (TT&C) stations, which send the signals\nto the navigation satellites and also receive telemetry\ndata from them.\n\nThe GMS is responsible for the correct generation\nof timing and navigation signals. For this purpose\nthe signals which are broadcast from the satellites are\ncontinuously monitored with a global network of\nsensor stations and passed on to the control center.\nIn the GCC the respective control commands and\nintegrity data are generated and transmitted over a\ncommunication network to uplink stations (ULS)\nsending the GMS command to the satellites.\n\nTransfer Segment\n\nTaking Galileo as an example, the selected launcher\nwill transfer the satellites of the constellation directly\ninto MEO, using double or multiple launchers, depen-\nding on the capacity of the selected rocket.\n\nUser Segment\n\nThe user segment refers to the navigation terminal\n(or radio) consisting of antenna, receiver electronics\nand output unit for the position data.

    "578": "7.3 Navigation\n\n7.3.2.2 GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and COMPASS\n\nThe first satellite navigation system available world-\nwide was GPS. On February 21, 1978 the first GPS\nsatellite was launched into orbit on-board a Delta\nIV rocket. Although GPS was used intensively for\nmilitary operations during the Gulf War in 1991,\nthe system did not reach full operational capability\nbefore 1995.\n\nGPS is operated and further developed exclu-\nsively by the US military. It is under the control\nof the US Space Command (USSPACECOM) in\nColorado, which is responsible for commanding and\ncontrolling all US military space activities. Even if\ncivilian GPS applications come to predominate and\nlarge worldwide commercial interest exist in GNSS\napplications, the whole GPS system itself remains a\nmilitary system.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union advanced\n\nthe development of its own military navigation system,\nnamed GLONASS. However, due to the limited lifetime\nof the first GLONASS satellites and the lack of funds\nat the end of the Cold War, full operational capability\nhas not yet been achieved. In recent times increasing\nefforts have again been undertaken to further develop\nand complete the GLONASS constellation.\nThe most important difference between GPS\nand GLONASS is the signal type. All GPS satellites\ntransmit on the same frequencies. The distinction\namong individual satellites is achieved by the CDMA\nsignal structure (which is also used for mobile phone\nsignals), while GLONASS satellites are identified by\nslightly different transmitter frequencies (FDMA\nprinciple with 8 MHz separation). This prevents the\nuse of signals from both systems at the same time with\nsimple cost-efficient receivers.\n\nEurope is in the process of developing and deploy-\ning the first civilian navigation system, called Galileo.\nAt present the first two test satellites are in orbit and\nthe first four satellites of the constellation are under\ndevelopment. The completion of Galileo is planned\nfor the year 2013.\n\nAdditionally, China has advanced its plans to\ndevelop its own system, named COMPASS. Respective\nregistrations for frequencies and orbital positions\nhave been filed and the first test satellites have been\ndeployed in orbit. At present the system comprises\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:557\n\n557\n\nfive geostationary satellites, three satellites in inclined\ngeosynchronous orbits and 27 satellites with MEO\norbits at an altitude of 27 840 km. The geostationary\nsatellites are called Beidou, the Chinese name for the\nastronomical constellation Ursa Major. Beidou-1A\nand 1B are test satellites that were launched on October\n30 and December 20, 2000. The next generation of\nsatellites will become part of the Chinese navigation\nsystem. They are planned to take positions over the\nAsia\u2014Pacific area at 58.75\u00b0E, 80\u00b0, 110.5\u00b0E and 140\u00b0E.\nBeidou-2A (formerly Beidou-1C) was launched on\nMay 24, 2003. The fourth satellite was launched into\norbit at the beginning of February 2007. The first\nMEO satellite was launched in April 2007.\n\nSince China is also involved in the European\nGalileo system at the same time, it remains unclear\nhow COMPASS will evolve in future.\n\nTable 7.3.1 gives an overview of the characteristics\nof the different GNSS systems [7.3.3], [7.3.4], [7.3.6].\n\n7.3.3 Space Segment\n\n7.3.3.1 Navigation Satellite Components\n\nNavigation satellites consist of standard satellite\nsubsystems (see Chapter 4) and specific payload\nsubsystems dedicated to navigation functions (e.g.,\natomic clocks, signal generators). The most important\ncomponents are described below using the Galileo\nsatellite as an example:\n\nOn-board the Galileo satellites two passive\nhydrogen masers and two rubidium atomic clocks\nare planned. Each is used to generate the frequency\nand time standard to high accuracy, stability and the\nlowest possible noise level.\n\nFor frequency generation using passive hy-\ndrogen masers the hyperfine structure transition\n(AE= 10\u00b0 eV or f= 1.420 GHz) of atomic hydrogen\nis used. To this end the activated hydrogen atoms are\nfed into a quartz resonator, in which the atoms radi-\nate at highly stable frequencies due to the long decay\ntime of about 1 second. This frequency is amplified\nin a resonant mode by external electronics and used\nas the frequency standard for signal generation on-\nboard the satellite. The resulting time stability is better\nthan 0.5 ns in 12 h.\n\n2/24/09 2:39:02 PM\n",

This type is also\nused on-board GPS and GLONASS satellites. A time\nstability of approximately 1.5 ns in 12 h is achieved\nby using the hyperfine structure line of rubidium-87\nat 6.835 GHz. If rubidium atoms in a hot gas are\npumped with an external microwave at exactly this\nfrequency, then the rubidium atoms are activated\nfrom their ground state to a higher energy state\nin which the absorption of an external rubidium\nlight source reaches its maximum. A photodiode\ndetermines this absorption peak, and the frequency\nof the external microwave is adjusted to keep the\nabsorption peak at maximum.\n\nFor monitoring and controlling the four clocks\nof a Galileo satellite, the so-called clock monitoring\nand control unit is used, which also interfaces with\n\nCHO7.indd Sect:558 \u00a9\n\nthe signal generator. For example, it must be always\nensured that the master clock and the active redundant\nclocks are synchronized in order to ensure seamless\nswitching in case of master clock failure.\n\nThe navigation signal generator unit (NSGU)\ncombined with the frequency upconverter unit generate\nthe navigation signals (carrier frequency, modulation\nand navigation message) based on the master atomic\nclock frequency standard and the data stream received\nfrom the GCC.\n\nThese L-band signals on-board the Galileo satellites\nare then amplified by solid-state power amplifiers\n(SSPAs). At a transmission power level of 50 W per\nsignal, a minimum dissipation loss and a maximum\nof linearity are required.\n\nThe antenna system consists of an L-band an-\ntenna for transmitting the navigation signals in the\n\n2/24/09 2:39:02 PM\n",

The S-band antenna is used for sending\nand receiving the telemetry (TM) and telecommand\n(TC) data. Additionally, the S-band channel serves as\nbackup for ranging (at meter accuracy) and as backup\nchannel for the uplink of mission data.\n\nThe laser retroreflector is used for measurements\nof satellite orbit data to subdecimeter accuracy. These\nmeasurements are not part of the routine operations\nprocedures but used for monitoring and calibration.\nOnly a few GPS and some GLONASS satellites are\nequipped with laser reflectors.\n\nTo protect the TM/TC data as well as to encode the\nprotected signals (CS and PRS) special cryptographic\ncomponents (payload and platform security unit) are\nused on-board the Galileo satellites.\n\n7.3.3.2 Satellite Orbits\n\nThe prerequisite for determining receiver position\nby means of trilateration is the continuous and exact\nknowledge of transmitter position, that is the accurate\norbital position of the transmitting antenna center\npoint. Using the orbit parameters transmitted in the\nnavigation data message, the position can be predicted\nwith an accuracy of a few meters. This is even more\nremarkable if one considers that the orbital altitude of\nthe satellites is 26 560 km for GPS and 23 616 km for\nGalileo and that the prediction is based on measure-\nments which are usually older than 10 hours.\n\nIdeal Orbits\n\nKepler\u2019s laws describe to a first approximation the\n\nmovement of navigation satellites around the Earth\n\n[7.3.7]. These can be derived from Newton\u2019s laws.\nFora central gravitation potential and the respective\n\nequation of motion the following applies:\n\nV(r, \u00ae, y=, p= \u2122,\nr r\n\n(7.3.2)\n\nSolving this equation of motion results in an elliptical\norbit, with the Earth\u2019s center of gravity at one of the\ntwo focal points. The satellite orbits are preferably\ndescribed by the so-called six Keplerian elements\n(see Section 2.2).\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:559\n\n559\n\nPerturbation of Ideal Orbit\n\nDeviations from the spherical gravitational potential\nand additional force excited by other causes have an\nextremely small impact on the satellite orbits, but\nto achieve their computation with a precision of a\nfew meters or better, these effects must be taken into\naccount.\n\nNoncentric Gravitational Forces of the Earth:\nThe Earth is not absolutely spherical; its density\ndistribution is not homogeneous (or spherical) and\nthis distribution varies over time. To the next order\nof approximation the Earth is described as a spheroid\nwith its equatorial radius being about 20 km larger\nthan the polar radius.

Therefore the GPS data message contains an\nextended set of parameters (so-called quasi-Keplerian\nelements) describing the satellite orbits.\n\nGPS Orbits\nThe GPS satellites have an orbital velocity of 3.9 km/s\nand a period of half a sidereal day, which is about 11 h\n58 min. The mean distance to the Earth\u2019s center is\n26 560 km. The nominal GPS constellation consists\nof six planes with each plane having four equally\nspaced satellite positions, although today more than\n24 satellites are usually active. The six orbital planes\nall have an inclination of 55\u00b0 relative to the equa-\ntorial plane. The right ascensions of the ascending\nnode for the six orbital planes are separated by 60\u00b0\nin the equatorial plane. The 55\u00b0 inclination results in\nsatellite positions between 55\u00b0N and 55\u00b0S latitude.\nThe satellites of block I had a different orbital plane\ninclination of 63\u00b0.\nWith this GPS constellation, the polar regions have\nbelow-average coverage (in contrast to the TRANSIT\nsystem, which had above-average coverage of polar\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nregions due to its polar orbits). As a result, signal\nreception at high northern and southern latitudes is\nonly possible with accordingly lower elevations. On\nthe other hand, this GPS constellation shows very\ngood and homogeneous satellite coverage for the\nmore densely populated areas between these latitudes,\nwhich guarantees high availability with at least four\nsatellites in view. Additionally this design leads to a\nrelatively stable constellation since interfering factors\n(e.g., gravitational fields, solar winds) on average affect\nall satellites in the same way.\n\nEphemeris\n\nThe computed satellite orbits and velocity data are\ncalled satellite ephemerides. The GPS ephemerides are\ncomputed with a so-called quasi-Keplerian model,\nwhich has an extended set of 15 (instead of 6) Keplerian\nelements. Parameter No. 16 shows the reference time\nfor the set of ephemeris parameters, and parameter\nNo. 17 (issue of data ephemeris (IODE)) indicates any\nalteration to the set of parameters. The following list\nfrom the GPS Interface Specifications (IS-GPS-200D,\n2004) shows all parameters (Table 7.3.3).\n\nThe three parameters An, Q and IDOT describe\nthe linear variation over time of the mean anomaly,\nthe angle of the ascending node and the inclination\nangle.\n\nThree pairs of parameters (C,,, C,. with x= u, 1, i)\ndescribe the second-harmonic term of the satellite\norbits as a function of the argument of latitude \u00a2\n(angle of the satellite position in the orbital plane\nmeasured from the equator).

The quasi-Keplerian elements are generated\nin the master control station (MCS), and with each\nuplink sequence to a GPS satellite a set of parameters\nfor the next 14 days is sent.

Additionally, each GPS\nsatellite transmits a parameter set for the complete\nGPS constellation with reduced accuracy in the form\nof an almanac. This almanac is helpful for receivers\nacquiring signals; for example, the signal search area\ncan therefore be limited to the number of satellites\ntheoretically visible over the horizon, or when the\nascent of a satellite over the horizon is expected, the\nsignal search can be started. The almanac parameters\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:561\n\n561\n\nprovide only for a linear clock model and the set\nof quasi-Keplerian elements comprises only seven\nparameters.\n\nPrecise Ephemeris\n\nPrecise ephemerides can be made available by ter-\nrestrial services. For example, the IGS (International\nGNSS Service) has a network of over 350 reference\nstations worldwide. At present the following data is\navailable from the IGS: ultra rapid predicted (ephe-\nmeris in real time with approx. 10 cm accuracy),\nultra rapid observed (three hours of latency and\naccuracy <5 cm), rapid (17-hour latency and accu-\nracy <5 cm) and final (13-day latency and accuracy\n<5cm).\n\nGalileo Orbit\n\nThe Galileo constellation is planned as a Walker\n(27/3/1) constellation in order to achieve the maxi-\nmum possible complete and continuous coverage of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nA Walker constellation (T/P/F) consists of satel-\nlites in circular orbits with equal orbital altitude Hand\ninclination I. A Walker constellation is characterized\nby the following set of parameters: orbital altitude H,\ninclination J, total number of satellites T, number of\norbital planes P (whose nodes are equally distributed\nat the equator) and relative distance F between satel-\nlites in neighboring planes (F=0 to P\u2014 1 in multiples\nof the pattern unit PU = 360\u00b0/T).\n\nFor the Galileo constellation the semi-major axis\nA= 29 994 km, which corresponds to a mean orbital\naltitude of H = 23 616 km. The Galileo orbits have an\ninclination of I= 56\u00b0.\n\nThe Galileo constellation will consist of T= 27\nsatellites, which are placed on P = 3 orbital planes. Thus\nthe pattern unit PU = 360\u00b0/27 = 13!/3 \u00b0. This results in\na distance of the satellites in one plane of 360\u00b0 - P/T=\nPU: P= 40\u00b0 and a distance between nodes of 360\u00b0/P\n= 120\u00b0. The phase difference between the Galileo sa-\ntellites in successive planes is PU- F = 131/3\u00b0.\n\nAdditionally, a spare satellite will be placed in\neach orbital plane, so that 30 Galileo satellites will be\ndeployed altogether on three orbital planes.\n\nThe sidereal period of a Galileo satellite amounts\nto 14h4 min 42 sand after 17 revolutions, or 10 days,\nthe satellites again reach their starting points.\n\n2/24/09 2:39:03 PM\n",

In the case of Galileo two GCCs are\nplanned in Germany and Italy, forming the backbone\nof the Galileo ground segment.\n\nThe Galileo ground segment consists of two major\nparts: the ground control segment (GCS) and the\nground mission segment (GMS).\n\nThe GCS is responsible for the satellites\u2019 platform\noperations and their correct orbital positions. Five\nTT&C stations are available, which are globally distri-\nbuted and which transmit telecommands and receive\nsatellite monitoring data utilizing 13 m antennas for\nS-band (2.6-3.95 GHz) communications.\n\nThe GMS is responsible for the delivery of cor-\nrect navigation signals and for monitoring system\nintegrity. Therefore, the state of each satellite is\ncontinuously monitored in order to ensure that\nthe transmitted signals are within specified tole-\nrances. If deviations outside the specified values are\ndetected, it will be ensured that users will receive\ninformation about the defective or missing signals\nwithin 6 seconds. The transmitted navigation signal\nis composed of the accurate time derived from the\non-board atomic clocks, the precise satellite orbit\ndata and the integrity information.\n\nThe necessary monitoring data is generated using\na network of over 40 Galileo sensor stations (GSS),\nwhich permanently track all visible Galileo L-band\nsignals with special reference receivers. This data\nstream is centrally collected and processed in combi-\nnation with further information (e.g., accurate timing\nsignals from ground station atomic clocks, ionosphere\ndata). A specific GMS computer then calculates new\norbit and clock data for each satellite. In addition,\nthe synchronization of all on-board clocks with the\nGCC clocks, an orbit forecast valid for the next few\nhours and an integrity assessment for all satellites\nare performed. This computation is accomplished\nevery 10 minutes.

The TC uplink frequency is\n2225 MHz. In addition, the TC uplink is used as an\nadditional communication channel for sending the\nnavigation data produced by the GMS to the satellite\nonce per satellite orbital period.

Additionally, local monitoring and\ncontrol units are installed in each TT&C station and\nare controlled and monitored by the CMCF over the\nSDDN. The consolidated TT&C data is preprocessed\nby the CMCF and forwarded to the SCCF for overall\ncoordination and synchronization of the satellite\noperations. Normally the CMCF is operated auto-\nmatically; however, it has manual access features for\nspecial operations and maintenance.\n\nThe CMCF transmits aggregated data to the\nground asset control facility (GACF), which is part\nof the GMS. This is because the overall monitoring\nand control functions of all Galileo ground elements\nare performed and coordinated in the GACF.\n\nGCS Elements without Real-Time Requirements\n\nSpacecraft Constellation Planning Facility (SCPF)\nThe SCPF performs short-term planning for the GCS\ntasks. SCPF planning includes the operational acti-\nvities for constellation control and is responsible for\nscheduling the satellite contact time slots. For this task\nit is required that the data exchange requests between\nthe 30 satellites and the five TT&C stations be perfor-\nmed with an optimum schedule. To this end the SCPF\nis subordinate to GMS planning and communicates\nwith the GMS data sets relevant for medium-term\nplanning, for example payload maintenance, satellite\nmaneuvers or software update procedures. This also\nresults in additional requests for TT&C contact time\nslots.\n\nFlight Dynamics Facility (FDF)\n\nThe FDF calculates forecasts for satellite orbits and\nattitudes and supports the planning for satellite con-\ntrol maneuvers. This serves for both the control of\nindividual satellites as well as the overall management\nof the entire constellation.\n\nNormally the FDF uses satellite orbit data provi-\nded by the GMS. Additionally, the FDF can use for its\norbital computations data coming from the two-way\nS-band propagation time measurements provided by\nthe TT&C stations. This allows satellite control (e.g.,\nfor special operations or in emergency situations)\ncompletely independent of the availability or func-\ntioning of the GMS.\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nOperation Preparation Facility (OPF)\n\nThe OPF with its special editors covers the deve-\nlopment and maintenance of operational data and\nprocedures. Additional elements of the OPF guarantee\na consistency check of the configuration data and\nsupport the import and export of software elements\nfor the satellites\u2019 on-board computers.\n\nConstellation Simulator (CSIM)\n\nThe CSIM provides a comprehensive simulation\ntool for the entire constellation and ground systems\nincluding the TT&C stations. The CSIM is used to\nvalidate operational data and procedures, to investi-\ngate anomalies and also for test and training purposes.\nEach satellite is described by a state model that reacts\nto TC data input and returns via TM an appropriate\ndata output. The simulator is able to process several\nscenarios in parallel which reflect different constella-\ntion situations.\n\nIntegrated Logistics Support Tools (ILS Tools)\n\nThe complex Galileo infrastructure must be carefully\n\nsupervised and maintained during its complete ope-\n\nrational lifetime. For this logistics task so-called ILS\n\ntools are made available. Their main functions are\n\narranged as follows:\n\ne Logistics management information system\n(LMIS)\n\ne Central document management system (CDMS)\n\ne Integrated logistics support database\n\ne Logistics support analysis (LSA) development\ntools.\n\nThe ILS tools are not a direct part of the GCS elements\nand therefore are hosted on separate servers; they are\n\naccessible to operations personnel via the administra-\ntive LAN of the GCCs.\n\nGCS Interfaces to External Facilities\nThe GCS interfaces to other facilities and/or service\nproviders are illustrated in Figure 7.3.2.\n\nIn particular the data exchange between GCS and\nGMS is important.

In order to fulfill the GST requirements\nwith respect to TAI synchronicity, the so-called TSPs\n(usually UTC time laboratories) supply steering\nparameters to the GMS.

Therefore an offset results\nbetween the SI second and sidereal time. Normally\natomic time and TAI are not directly used. Instead,\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) is of practical\nrelevance. As with the atomic time standard, UTC is\nbased on the SI second. The relation between UTC and\nthe various national real-time realizations (e.g., UTC\n(NPL)) is published posteriorly by the Bureau Internati-\nonal des Poids et Mesures (BIMP) in monthly bulletins.\nThe deviation between UTC and universal sidereal\ntime (derived from the true phase angle of the Earth\u2019s\nrotation, i.e., the angle between the Greenwich meridian\nand vernal equinox) is limited to 0.9 seconds by the in-\ntroduction of a leap second. Since the last introduction\nof a leap second at the turn of the year 2008/2009, the\ndifference amounts to TAI \u2014 UTC = 34s.\n\nGPS time (GPST) is determined from a clock\nensemble composed of the cesium and rubidium\natomic clocks at the GPS ground stations and the\natomic clocks on-board the GPS satellites. As with\nUTC, GPST is also a weighted mean average time,\nbut with two substantial differences. GPST is available\nin real time and is a continuous time without leap\nseconds. It is steered to be as synchronous as possible\nwith UTC. In recent years the deviation from UTC\n(UNSO) was within about 10 ns (modulo 1 second).\nSince January 2009 the difference between UTC and\nGPST amounts to GPST \u2014- UTC= 15s.\n\nThis time difference is transmitted in the GPS\nnavigation data message, so that each receiver can\ncalculate UTC.\n\nThe first epoch of GPST started at midnight bet-\nween Saturday, January 5, and Sunday, January 6,\n1980; hence 00:00:00 UTC 06 January 1980. The\nGPST epoch is defined as a week number and a second\nwithin the current week, starting with the night of\nSaturday to Sunday.\n\nSince the GPS week is represented by 10 bits in\nthe navigation message, the first overflow and reset\nto week 0 took place between August 21 and 22, 1999.\nEvery 6 seconds the number of seconds in the current\nepoch is transmitted within each GPS satellite\u2019s navi-\ngation data message as a time stamp in synchrony with\nthe satellite clock. The GPS master control station\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:569\n\n569\n\n(MCS) controls all clocks on-board the GPS satellites\nand selects one per satellite for signal generation. The\ndeviation between the selected clock and GPST is\nmodeled with a quadratic function of time, and the\nparameters of this model are calculated in the MCS\nand transmitted as part of the broadcast navigation\ndata message.

The parameters are often\ncalled clock bias, drift and aging. The parameter ay\nis typically between 1 ps and 1 ms. Parameter a, is\nabout 10\u2014\" s/s. In the last few years it was frequently\nset to zero; a, = 0 s/s?.\n\nThe term At, considers the necessary relativistic\ntime adjustment. With these adjustment parameters,\nwhich are usually calculated once per day and then\ntransmitted to the satellites, the satellite clock errors\nare within about 5-10 ns.\n\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, a\nclock\u2019s frequency changes depending on its mo-\ntion and on the change in gravitational potential.\nThe clocks on-board satellites are about 20 000 km\nabove the geoids (which to a good approximation\nis identical to mean sea level) and therefore show a\nhigher frequency, as according to the general theory\nof relativity. Due to the satellite\u2019s velocity in orbit of\nabout 4 km/s, the clocks are slower than clocks on the\nEarth\u2019s surface. At an altitude of about 3000 km these\ntwo effects would compensate each other. A clock ina\ncircular orbit with a radius of 26 560 km would gain\n38.4 ys per day compared to a clock on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. In order to compensate for this, the GPS on-\nboard clocks are not tuned to the nominal frequency\nof 10.23 MHz, but are set to a different frequency,\nwhich is reduced by the so-called \u201cfactory offset\u201d of\n0.004 567 3 Hz.\n\nSince the GPS orbits are not perfectly circular, but\nelliptical, the deviations resulting from relativistic effects\nmust be corrected by the receivers.

As part of the WGS84\nstandard, a global reference spheroid which best\napproximates the Earth\u2019s surface is defined. The term\nWGS$84 represents the datum, the fundamental system\nand the reference spheroid, which is called GRS80.\nThe WGS84 standard has been taken over by EURO-\nCONTROL in the meantime also for aviation.\n\nIn addition to this global reference frame, numerous\nlocal reference frames are used. In Germany, for exam-\nple, a local reference ellipsoid (Bessel ellipsoid, named\nafter Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel) with its fundamental\npoint in Rauenberg is known as the Potsdam Datum.\nIn the future, the European Terrestrial Reference\nSystem 1989 (ETRS89) will be used as the European\nstandard for land survey.\n\nETRS89 is a three-dimensional geodetic reference\nsystem. It was defined by the European Subcommittee\nof the IAG (EUREF). It was fixed to the stable part\nof the Eurasian continental plate and is identical to\nITRS at epoch 1989.0. ETRS89 is realized by EUREF\nthrough a sporadically published ETRF_YY (Euro-\npean Terrestrial Reference Frame, with designation\nyear) and specifies three-dimensional coordinates\nand velocities for selected fixed points determined\nby global measurement procedures such as very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI), satellite laser ranging\n(SLR) and by utilizing GPS and Doppler orbitography\nand radiopositioning integrated by satellite (DORIS).\nThese reference points are used in the definition of\nthe hierarchical level A of the ETRF. During the 1980s\nand 1990s mobile measurement campaigns took place\nat ground-marked fixed points. Today, on the Euro-\npean level ETRS89 is generated from permanent GPS\nmeasurements at reference sites of the EPN (EUREF\nPermanent GPS Network). As a result of the long\nobservation times and the stability of the reference\nsites, which are fixed on solid buildings, an accuracy\nof a few millimeters is achieved. The velocity of the\nreference sites represents the Earth\u2019s surface movement\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\non the Eurasian Plate. ETRS89 was recommended by\nthe European Union as the uniform reference system\nfor European geodata. At the epoch 01 January 1989\nthe coordinates from ETRS89 and WGS84 differed\nby less than 1 m.\n\n7.3.5.2 Navigation Signals\n\nThe navigation signals consist of three components:\ncarrier frequency, pseudo-random noise (PRN)\ncode and navigation data [7.3.3], [7.3.4]. Figure 7.3.3\nshows this structure and the resulting signals on the\nbasis of the GPS C/A code in the L1-band.\n\nAll signals are derived from the primary pulse\nof the atomic clock on-board the satellites and all\nsignals are synchronized with the on-board clock.\nThe carrier frequencies of all satellite navigation\nsignals are in the L-band between 1.2 and 1.6 GHz\n[7.3.10], [7.3.11]. The so-called PRN code is mo-\ndulated onto the carrier frequency. The PRN code\nvaries for each satellite and is characterized by special\nmathematical features which permit all signals to be\nsent in the same frequency band without mutual in-\nterference. The autocorrelation function of the signal\nis maximum, while the cross-correlation function\nbetween different satellite signals is minimum. Thus,\nby using a PRN code replica stored in the receivers,\nthe satellites can be uniquely identified. The PRN\ncode also serves as the basis for propagation time\nmeasurements.\n\nAdditionally, the so-called navigation data is\nmodulated onto the PRN code. The navigation data\ncontains precise orbit data, clock parameters, rough\norbit data of all satellites (almanac), ionosphere data\nand satellite status data. The transmission of the com-\nplete navigation message takes 12.5 minutes. On the\nbasis of this information the receiver can determine an\naccurate satellite position at the time of signal trans-\nmission and the respective satellite time (measured\nin the global system time). The transmission position\nand time allow calculation of the propagation time\nof the signal.\n\nIn order to fulfill various technical requirements\nand to make position determination as precise\nand reliable as possible, the navigation signals are\ntransmitted at multiple frequencies.

However,\nthe basic operational principle of GNSS receivers\nremains essentially unchanged. This principle is\ndescribed using the example of a simplified GPS\nreceiver structure.\n\nThe antenna receives L-band (1.2-1.6 GHz)\nsignals. A radiofrequency preamplifier followed by\na downconverter stage makes the signals available\nin baseband.\n\nEach GPS satellite is characterized by a specific PRN\n\ncode. The different signals from different satellites can\ntherefore be separated and tracked using a replication\nof the PRN code, which is stored in the receiver. To\nthis end the input signal is multiplied by the stored\ncode replication. For this process the code replication\nis shifted along the time axis until the maximum of the\ncorrelation function is reached. This time difference\nis transformed into a ranging value, which is called\nthe pseudo-range. The word \u201cpseudo\u201d refers to the\nfact that it does not reflect the real distance between\nreceivers and satellite, but only a receiver-internal\nvariable.\nThe data of the navigation message (ephemeris\nand parameter of the satellite clock) is used to compute\nposition, velocity and time, in combination with at least\nthree additional pseudo-range measurements. With\nthe navigation message data and at least four pseudo-\nranges it is possible to derive three position coordinates\nand the time. Figure 7.3.4 shows the respective signal\nflow within a receiver.\n\nAntenna\n\n573\n\nThis simple receiver structure is adapted and/or\nextended depending upon its application and requi-\nrements. Thus dual-frequency receivers have been\ndeveloped in order to correct ionospheric propagation\ntime variations. Recently, triple-frequency receivers\nhave also been developed and are available.\n\nFor applications requiring the highest preci-\nsion a class of receivers has been developed which\nin addition to the code phase measurements also\nutilizes L-band carrier phase measurements. Due to\nthe short wavelength of about 20 cm it is possible to\nachieve a relative accuracy of better than 5 cm, which\nis known as the carrier phase measurement or RTK\nmeasurement. For this type of measurement the error\nsources (such as orbit error, clock error, etc.) must be\ncancelled by differential correction technique and the\nphase ambiguity must be resolved.\n\nFor users requiring a maximum number of visible\nsatellites (e.g., RTK measurements under reduced\nsatellite visibility in urban canyons), multiconstellation\nreceiver types have been developed with simultaneous\nGPS and GLONASS signal processing capability. Com-\nbined GPS/Galileo receivers are available in prototype\nversions.\n\n7.3.7 Accuracy and Error Factors\n\nThe positioning is subject to numerous noise influ-\nences.

At accurately aligned reference\npoints, the deviations being produced are determined\nand transmitted to the user, for example by means of\nportable radio or satellite communication. Asa function\nof the latency of the adjustment data and the distance\nfrom the reference station, the satellite error can be\nreduced to below a few centimeters.\n\n7.3.7.2 Signal Propagation Error\n\nThe propagation velocity of the signals from the\nsatellite to the ground receiver can be altered by the\nterrestrial atmosphere. A distinction is made between\nionosphere- and troposphere-introduced errors.\n\nThe concentration and distribution of free elec-\ntrons in the ionosphere can vary considerably, for\ninstance due to changes in the solar wind. These fluc-\ntuations can sometimes occur on small scales where\nthe diameter of local ionospheric turbulence is under\n50 km. The runtime fluctuations can cause errors of\nup to several meters. By using two-frequency recei-\nvers, the propagation time effects can be modeled in\nvarious frequency bands and a significant part of this\nerror can be corrected. Nevertheless, at times of high\nsolar activity substantial limitations on the measuring\naccuracy can be observed.\n\n\\_{ivuitipath propagation +1 m) LY Antenna error +0.5 m\n\nThe humidity of the troposphere (clouds, rain)\nlikewise leads to altered signal propagation times.\nUsually the error caused here is less than about 1 m.\n\nSignals which did not arrive in the direct line\nof sight of the receiver but were reflected by the\nenvironment of the receiver (e.g., by houses, objects\nin the vicinity or on the ground) show a deceptive\nposition. This effect is called multipath propagation.\nNumerous receiver technologies have been developed\nto suppress this positioning error. For example, the\nsignal shape (changes are caused by rapid phase jumps\nduring reflection), or an evaluation of only the directly\nreceived signals and a suppression of delayed signals,\ncan be used to identify and reduce the multipath effect\nin the receiver.\n\n7.3.7.3 Receiver Errors\n\nSince the satellite signals are extremely weak (107\u00b0 W),\nthe thermal noise of the receiver substantially limits\nthe proper evaluation of the signal [7.3.3]. Temporal\ncorrelation between received signal and stored code\nreplica is possible with a resolution of about 1% of\nthe chip rate of the signal, which corresponds to\na GPS C/A code resolution of about 10 ns and/or\nabout 3 m. With the GPS P(Y) code the chip rate is\n10 times higher, which reduces this error to about\n0.3 m, making it negligible when combined with the\nother sources of error.\n\nDepending upon receiver cost and design, the\nphase noise of the receiver clock and changes in the\nantenna\u2019s center may be significant factors in error\nanalysis.\n\n2/24/09 2:39:08 PM\n",

Space activities have opened up\nentirely new possibilities in astronomy and also for\nthe exploration of outer space.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:575\n\n575\n\nGround-based astronomical observations are\nrestricted to those wavelength ranges for which the\nterrestrial atmosphere is transparent. This restriction,\nobviously, no longer applies to satellites, which allow\nobservations without the disturbing influence of the\natmosphere. This refers to X-ray, gamma, ultraviolet\nand infrared astronomy. But the atmosphere also\naffects observations in the visible range, which is why,\nfor example, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) allows\nmuch better observations compared to the (some-\ntimes much larger) ground-based telescopes.\n\nThe second aspect of space activity is the explora-\ntion of our Solar System. Since the 1960s the planets\nof the Solar System have been \u201cvisited\u201d by space probes,\nfirst in the course of fly-by missions, later with orbiters\nand landers. The study of Earth\u2019s Moon has played a\nparticularly important role.\n\n7.4.1 Astronomy Missions\n\nFigure 7.4.1 shows the opacity (1/transmission) of\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere as a function of wavelength. It\nindicates that observations in the visible range in the\nnear ultraviolet and infrared, as well as in the radio\nwave range, are possible from the ground. However,\nthe electromagnetic spectra of shorter wavelengths as\nwell as of lower energy infrared cannot be observed\nfrom the ground and could only be \u201cdiscovered\u201d with\nsatellites.\n\n7.4.1.1 X-ray Satellites\n\nThe first satellite to discover cosmic X-rays was\nOSO-3 (Orbiting Solar Observatory) in 1960. OSO-3\nwas actually designed to observe the Sun; however,\nit also detected diffuse cosmic X-rays.\n\n100%\n50%\n\n0%.\nO.1nm tm 10m 100nm 1pm 102m 100\u00a5m 1mm tom 10cm 1m 10m 100m 1km\n\nFigure 7.4.1: Opacity of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere as a function of\nwavelength (Source: NASA).\n\n2/24/09 2:39:09 PM\n",

Uhuru\nprovided the first X-ray map of the sky in the energy\nrange between 2 and 20 keV.\n\nMany missions followed, two examples are briefly\ndescribed below: ROSAT and XMM-Newton.\n\nROSAT (Roentgen Satellite), a German\u2014US-\u2014\nBritish joint effort, was launched in June 1990 and\nwas in operation for nine years until February 1999.\nIts sensors were about 1000 times more sensitive than,\nfor example, those of Uhuru. The payload consisted\nof a telescope, which could be combined with either\na position-sensitive proportional counter (PSPC) or\nan imaging instrument (high-resolution imager, HRI),\nas well as a wide-angle camera.\n\nA total of about 150 000 X-ray sources were map-\nped. Supernova remnants, galaxy clusters, neutron\nstars and many other phenomena were investigated\nin detail.\n\nXMM-Newton (X-ray Multimirror), a mission of\nthe European Space Agency (ESA), was launched in 1999\nwith a nominal service life of 10 years (Figure 7.4.2). For\n\nFigure 7.4.2: XMM in the ESTEC integration room (Source: ESA/D.\nParker).\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nthe first time optical and X-ray observations could be\ncombined. XMM is distinguished by its high sensitivity.\nThe energy range covered by the three X-ray telescopes\nextends from 0.1 to 15 keV.\n\n7.4.1.2 Gamma Ray Astronomy\n\nSpace-bound observations allow investigation of the\neven higher energetic gamma radiation. The first\nsatellite to do so was Explorer 11, launched in 1961.\nAt that time scientists were able to identify 22(!)\ngamma particles. Subsequent satellites in the 1960s and\n1970s (originally intended to detect tests of nuclear\nweapons) provided among other observations the first\nhints of the phenomenon of gamma bursts.\n\nIn 1991 NASA launched the Compton Gamma\nRay Observatory, which was in operation until 2000.\nWith its 17 ton payload (until that time the heaviest\nastronomy payload ever launched) and four different\ninstruments, Compton could cover the energy range\nup to 30 GeV.\n\nSince 2002 the European gamma ray observatory\nIntegral has been in orbit. Integral studies the most\nenergetic and most exotic phenomena in the Universe\nsuch as supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, gamma\nbursts and active galaxy cores. It combines gamma,\nX-ray and optical observations.\n\n7.4.1.3 Infrared Satellites\n\nSince the 1970s there have been discussions about also\ninvestigating the infrared sky with orbiting observato-\nries. The particular challenge of such missions is the\nfact that the sensors need to be cooled.\n\nIn 1983, IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite),\na joint project of the USA, the Netherlands and the\nUK, was launched. The telescope itself was integrated\ninto a Dewar container and cooled with liquid helium.\nThe mission duration was about 10 months (until the\navailable helium was used up); 96% of the sky was\nimaged several times, and over half a million infrared\nsources were detected. The core of the Milky Way could\nbe imaged for the first time.\n\nIn 1995 ESA launched the European Infrared\nScience Observatory (ISO), which monitored the\ninfrared sky in another wavelength range (2.5-240 um)\nfor two and a half years with a sensitivity about 1000\n\n2/24/09 2:39:09 PM\n",

ISO discovered, for\nexample, water ice in interstellar dust clouds and\nhydrocarbons in planetary nebula. Figure 7.4.3 shows\nan artist\u2019s impression of ISO in orbit.\n\nThe next step in infrared astronomy will be the\nHerschel-Planck mission (formerly called FIRST)\nplanned to be launched by ESA in 2009. Herschel\nwill cover the wavelength range from far infrared to\nsubmillimeter (60 to 670 um). Planck (to be launched\nsimultaneously with Herschel on an Ariane 5 rocket)\nwill investigate the cosmic background radiation\n(about 2.7 K).\n\nThe first satellite to investigate this extreme long-\nwave infrared range was COBE (Cosmic Background\nExplorer), launched by NASA in 1989. Theories about\nthe big bang were confirmed; the variations of the\ncosmic background are extremely small (2.725 +\n0.002 K).\n\n7.4.1.4 The Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope (named after the Ameri-\ncan astronomer Edwin Hubble) should be mentioned\nin particular because of its enormous influence on our\nunderstanding of the Universe.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:577\n\n577\n\nWhile observations from ground-based telescopes\nare always disturbed by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n(\u201cseeing\u201d), this problem disappears in outer space. The\nHST could, thus, provide images of unprecedented\nsharpness.\n\nOnly a few of the many discoveries and observa-\ntions that were accomplished with the HST are listed\nbelow:\n\ne The age of the Universe was determined at 13 to\n14 billion years.\n\ne Protoplanetary disks (solar systems in an early\nphase of their formation) were imaged.\n\ne Supernova explosions, showing unanticipated\nstructures, were detected.\n\ne Very distant and old galaxies were observed\nwhich allowed a glance at the early epochs of the\nUniverse.\n\ne Valuable data was obtained on the physics of\nblack holes.\n\ne Theacceleration of the expansion of the Universe\nwas measured, indicating the existence of dark\nenergy.\n\nAs early as 1923, Hermann Oberth, the German rocket\npioneer, was the first to have the idea of launching a\ntelescope into space. NASA\u2019s \u201cLarge Space Telescope\u201d\nproject has existed since 1969, and the launch of\nthe HST was eventually planned for 1986. However,\nbecause of the Space Shuttle accident in that year the\nlaunch had to be postponed until April 1990.\n\nFive instruments were on-board:\ne Wide-field/planetary camera\ne High-resolution spectrograph\ne Faint-object camera (an ESA contribution)\ne Faint-object spectrograph\ne High-speed photometer.\n\nDue to problems with the optics at the beginning of\nthe mission, the images provided by the HST were not\nas sharp as expected.\n\nDuring an HST servicing mission in 1993 the\nproblem was eliminated by adding a corrective lens\nsystem (COSTAR). Other servicing missions took\nplace in 1997, 1999 and 2002. The last of such missions\nhas been approved for 2009.\n\nFigure 7.4.4 shows astronauts Jim Newman and\nMike Massimino removing the faint-object camera\n\n2/24/09 2:39:12 PM\n",

Assuming as starting\noint a circular parking orbit at about 320 km altitude\n(e.g., the scenario for Mars Express, launched with\n\nSoyuz Fregat; orbit velocity 7.7 km/s), an acceleration\nof an additional 3.2 km/s is required, as a minimum,\nin order to reach the escape velocity of 10.9 km/s.\nTo reach another planet, the probe must be put into\nan orbit around the Sun where (in the energetically\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:587\n\n587\n\nTable 7.4.4: Velocities for Hohmann transfer orbits.\n\nLaunch [km/s] Arrival [km/s] Flight time [a]\n\nMercury 7.5 9.6 0.3\nVenus -2.5 2.7 0.4\nMars 2.9 -2.7 0.7\nJupiter 8.8 -5.4 2.7\nSaturn 9.6 -5.4 6.0\n\noptimum case) aphelion and perihelion are at Earth\nand at the target body, respectively. Such a transfer\norbit, in which launch and arrival are exactly opposite\nto the Sun, is called Hohmann transfer.\n\nTable 7.4.4 lists the velocities required for trajec-\ntories from Earth to planets, as well as the velocity\nrelative to the planet at arrival. The second column\ngives the change in velocity required to leave the\norbit of the Earth around the Sun and reach the orbit\nof a particular planet by making use of a Hohmann\ntransfer (negative numbers indicate a deceleration).\nThe third column gives the relative velocities at which\nthe target planet is reached, and the last column the\ntransfer time in years.\n\nSince, as mentioned, start and arrival are 180\u00b0\napart in the solar orbit, the Earth and the target must\nbe in the correct position to each other at the time of\nlaunch. Accordingly, there are only specific launch\nwindows available for such missions. There are good\nlaunch possibilities for flights from Earth to Mars\nevery 2.13 years and from Earth to Venus every 1.6\nyears. (For the sake of completeness one should also\nmention the possibility of a 540\u00b0 transfer. This opens\nmore launch windows at the expense of a longer flight\ntime.) Because of the inclination and eccentricity of\nplanetary orbits, not all launch windows are energe-\ntically equally attractive.\n\n7.4.4.2 Orbit and Rendezvous Missions\n\nIf on arrival the probe is to be put into an orbit around\nthe target, then the arrival velocity (see Table 7.4.4)\nhas to be reduced. The velocity change required, Av,\nis shown in Equation 7.4.1 (with the escape velocity\nvy, and the arrival velocity v,):\n\n2/24/09 2:41:10 PM\n",
    "609": "CHO7.indd Sec1:588\n\n588\n\nAv=(ve+ vi) Ve (7.4.1)\nIt is therefore desirable to carry out this maneuver\nas close as possible to the target. For example, the\norbit insertion velocity for Mars at 300 km altitude\nis 680 m/s:\n\nAv= (4.817 + 2.65)\u00b0\u00b0 \u2014 4.81 = 0.68.\n\nAfter entry, some kind of orbit adjustment is usually\nnecessary, such as circularization. As discussed in more\ndetail in Section 7.4.5, deceleration can be supported\nby aerobreaking (gentle breaking by atmospheric\nfriction).\n\n7.4.4.3 Swing-by Maneuvers\n\nIn order to reduce the necessary velocity change to be\ncarried out with engines on interplanetary missions,\nso-called swing-by (gravity-assist) maneuvers can\nbe performed.\n\nWhen the probe flies through the gravity field of\na planet, part of the momentum of this planet around\nthe Sun is transferred to the spacecraft. If the planet is\nmoving away from the probe on its orbit around the\nSun, the probe gains kinetic energy (and vice versa).\n\nWithout gravity assist, many interplanetary missi-\nons would not be possible. In the case of the Rosetta\nmission, for example, four swing-by maneuvers are\nrequired (Earth, Mars, Earth, Earth). The resulting\nvelocity change adds up to a total of about 19 km/s.\n\nIf one or more swing-by maneuvers are required\nfor a mission, there are fewer launch windows, since\nthe planets involved have to be in the right relative\nconfiguration. For example, a mission to Saturn with\na swing-by at Jupiter is only possible about every\n20 years. The swing-by situation used for Voyager 2\n(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) occurs only\nevery 176 years!\n\n7.4.5 Key Technologies for Planetary\nMissions\n\nIn conclusion, some of the key technologies which are\nparticularly important for interplanetary missions are\n\ndescribed below.\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\n7.4.5.1 Thermal Control Systems for Extreme\nEnvironmental Conditions\n\nSince, by definition, missions in the Solar System\ntake place over a wide range of heliocentric distances,\nthermal design is often a particular challenge.\n\nUsually, technologies which are also used for satel-\nlites in Earth orbit are used (insulation, radiators, heat\npipes, a cleverly chosen relationship between absorption\nand emission (a/\u20ac) of the surfaces involved), but are\nadapted for the thermal conditions of the particular\nmission.\n\nMissions which move far away from the Sun or\nhave to survive long periods without solar illumina-\ntion (lunar night) are usually dependent on the use of\nradioactive heater units (RHUs). Radioactive decay\nproduces heat: 1 g of plutonium-238 provides about\n0.5 W of thermal power. Together with a thermoelec-\ntric generator (TEG), electrical power can also be\nobtained based on the Seebeck effect, which can be\nutilized for radiothermal generators (RTGs).\n\nBecause of the high toxicity of plutonium, the\nlaunch of probes containing this material is not\nonly demanding with respect to the required safety\nmeasures, but also politically problematic.\n\nHigh demands are made on the thermal insula-\ntion of interplanetary probes. Usually, multilayer\ninsulation (MLI) is used. It consists of numerous\n(typically about 10) layers of reflective plastic foils\n(e.g., aluminum on kapton), which functions (in a\nvacuum) similar to a \u201cmultiwalled thermos flask.\u201d\nUnder atmospheric conditions (as in the case of Mars\nor Venus landers), other methods have to be applied,\nfor example aerogels, which have a very low thermal\nconductivity.\n\nIf high-energy radiation causes problems (either\ndirectly from the Sun or as backscatter, e.g., from\nVenus) then coated mirrors (second surface mirrors\n(SSMs)) with a high reflection coefficient in the visible\nrange and high emissivity in the infrared are used to\ncover parts of the surface of the spacecraft.\n\n7.4.5.2 Radio Thermal Generators\n\nAs mentioned above, the heat generated by radio-\nactive material can be used together with a radiator\nto produce electrical power by making use of the\n\n2/24/09 2:41:13 PM\n",
    "610": "7.4 Space Astronomy and Planetary Missions\n\nFigure 7.4.21: Testing of the Voyager RTG (Source: NASA).\n\nSeebeck effect. Such systems are needed for missions\nbeyond the orbit of Jupiter, where solar cells are no\nlonger useful.\n\nSeveral semiconductors (e.g., Bi;Te;) are suitable\nfor producing electrical voltage if there are sufficiently\nhigh temperature gradients. An RTG therefore consists\nof a heating element (often plutonium-238 as oxide),\na thermoelectric generator (TEG) and a radiator for\nthe cold side.\n\nRTGs were used, for instance, for Pioneer 10 and\n11, Voyager, the Viking landers, Ulysses, Galileo, Cassi-\nni, and for long-term experiments placed on the Moon\nby Apollo. Figure 7.4.21 shows a Voyager RTG.\n\n7.4.5.3 Landing Systems\n\nOne special category of planetary missions includes\nsurface landing. In principle a distinction has to be\nmade between landing on bodies without an atmos-\nphere (like our Moon), on those with an atmosphere\n(Mars, Venus, Titan) and small bodies (asteroids and\ncomets).\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:589\n\n589\n\nIn the case of the last bodies, a low impact velocity\ncan be chosen because of the low gravitational forces.\nHigh-impact energy and landing shock are thus not as\nproblematic as for landings on planets or large moons.\nOn the other hand, the calculation and navigation of\nthe descent as well as the avoidance of any rebound\nare difficult.\n\nThe landing on a body with an atmosphere can\nbe supported by braking with an entry shield and a\nparachute system. The particular scenario depends\non the density and pressure of the atmosphere (the\nground pressure on Mars is about 10 mbar, on Venus\n90 bar and on Titan 1.6 bar), as well as on its chemical\ncomposition and the scale height.\n\nLanding on large bodies without an atmosphere\nrequires braking rockets, a fact which always leads\nto an unfavorable ratio between spacecraft mass and\npayload. This is the case for landing on the Moon, but\nalso, for example, on Mercury or Europa (there have\nbeen concrete plans to do so).\n\nThe landing itself either is controlled and typi-\ncally carried out on either landing legs (e.g., for\nSurveyor and Viking) or a landing platform (as for\nVenera), or involves an airbag system which encases\nthe entire lander when it hits the ground. In the latter\ncase the probe usually has to right itself (as for Luna\n9, Mars Pathfinder, MER) after the airbag is released\n(Figure 7.4.22).\n\nFor controlled landings, engines that can be throt-\ntled and altimeters are typically used.\n\n7.4.5.4 Long-Distance Communication Systems\n\nSince interplanetary probes are much further away\nfrom the Earth than are satellites, communication,\nconsequently, is more demanding.\n\nA decisive parameter in the operation of such mis-\nsions is the signal propagation time which is required\nfor a light or radio wave to travel from the Earth to\nthe probe (and vice versa).

    "613": "CHO7.indd Sec1:592\n\n592\n\n7.5.1 Microgravity\n7.5.1.1 Origins\n\nGravity is one of the fundamental forces of the Universe.\nAs with the electrostatic Coulomb force, it acts over\nlong distances. Whereas electric fields exert their force\nonly on charged (polarizable) bodies, gravity affects\nall bodies with mass. It owes its name to the fact that it\ninteracts with the gravitational mass, in contrast to the\ninertial mass of a body which describes its resistance to\nthe change of motion.\n\nThat gravity acts over long distances has the\nconsequence that Earth\u2019s gravitational field extends\nfar into space. The force of Earth\u2019s gravity at the\naltitude of the International Space Station (ISS)\nis, for example, still about 90% of its value on the\nsurface. So the reason for weightlessness on the ISS\nis not because there is no gravity field there. The\nphenomenon of apparent weightlessness has a dy-\nnamic cause and is related to the system of reference\nfrom which one observes the movement of other\nbodies. If we were in an elevator whose support\ncables had broken, putting us in free fall, we could,\nassuming we were cool-minded enough, let some\nobject in our possession drop and note that it was\nnot moving relative to ourselves. For us it would be\n\u201cweightless.\u201d But someone observing from outside\nwould see that both we and the object were in free\nfall due to the force of Earth\u2019s gravity. In terms of\nclassical physics, the outside observer is in an inertial\nframe of reference, whereas we are in an accelerated\nframe of reference compared to that inertial frame\nof reference. Newton\u2019s laws of classical mechanics are\nonly true for an inertial frame of reference. For the\nlaws of mechanics also to be valid for an accelerated\nframe of reference, we must postulate an additional\nforce which cancels the effect of gravity so that our\nobservation of the resting body is in accord with\nNewton\u2019s laws. This force is called the fictitious\nforce of inertia F; and is oppositely proportional to\nthe acceleration of the frame of reference relative to\nthe inertial frame of reference:\n\nFe=\u2014ms (7.5.1)\n\nWith the help of this fictitious force of inertia one can\nwrite the equation of motion of a point mass m in an\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\naccelerated frame of reference with the coordinates\nr' as follows:\n\nmi =mit+ (7.5.2)\n\nwith rthe coordinates of the point mass in the inertial\nframe of reference.\n\nIn the example of the free-falling elevator, * =\u2014g\nand \u00a7 =~g. Inserting these into Equation 7.5.2 it\nfollows that m7 =0\n\nEquation 7.5.2 is the basis for describing the\nphenomenon of weightlessness. It is true for the case\nof linear acceleration as in the ZARM drop tower in\nBremen, for weightlessness during parabolic flight,\nand for space vehicles orbiting the Earth like the ISS.\nIt should be mentioned that for the force of inertia it\nis the acceleration and not the velocity which is criti-\ncal. So the phase of weightlessness during a parabolic\nflight already begins during the ascending portion\nof the parabola, and accordingly ZARM recently\nintroduced an upward-catapulted launch instead\nof a regular drop, thereby doubling the duration of\nweightlessness.\n\nIn the case of rotational acceleration, the fictitious\nforce of inertia takes the form of centrifugal force.\nWhat happens on an experiment platform in orbit\ncan be most easily described by this force.\n\nFor a point mass m which circles the Earth at a\ndistance R and angular velocity @, the centrifugal\nforce amounts to\n\nF.=m@R (7.5.3)\n\nThis force has to compensate for the Earth\u2019s force of\nattraction, which is given by\n\nyMm\naa\n\nFo=\n\n, (7.5.4)\n\nwhere 7 is the gravitational constant and M the mass\nof the Earth. By equating both forces one obtains\n\nOR= y M= const. (7.5.5)\nwhich is nothing more than Kepler\u2019s third law. It says\n\nthat the squares of the orbital periods (T= 27/@) are\ndirectly proportional to the cubes of the radii.\n\n2/24/09 2:41:18 PM\n",

For an elongated body such as the\nISS, these forces are compensated only along a line\nwhich approximately corresponds to the trajectory of\nthe center of gravity of the space station (Figures 7.5.1\nand 7.5.2).\u2019 If one moves away from the center of gra-\nvity in a plane perpendicular to the flight direction,\ncompensation is not complete and one experiences\na residual force of gravity or \u201cmicrogravity.\u201d At an\naltitude of 300 km from the surface of the Earth this\nresidual gravity amounts to about 0.3- 107\u00b0g)/m in\nthe radial and 0.1- 10 \u00b0go/m in the lateral direction,\nwhere g is the value of the acceleration due to gravity\non the Earth\u2019s surface (g) = 9.81 m/s\u201d).\n\nFor relatively compact bodies like the ISS, this is a very good\napproximation.

One of them is the air resistance or\ndrag of the space vehicle, which at this altitude is not\nnegligible. It depends on the density of the remaining\natmosphere, the air stream over the surface and the\ncoefficient of friction.\n\nFor the ISS this leads to a residual gravity on the\norder of 10~\u00b0g). There are dedicated experiment plat-\nforms which compensate for this effect with a cold gas\npropulsion system.\n\nBesides these basically time-independent distur-\nbances there are also dynamic effects which cause\ntime-dependent residual gravity. In this category\ncan be listed the firing of attitude control propulsion\nsystem, but also all moving objects, including the\nastronauts themselves, which, following Newton\u2019s\nlaw that for every action there is an equal and oppo-\nsite reaction, cause the space vehicle to experience\n\n2/24/09 2:41:19 PM\n",

It is\naccordingly important when constructing subsystems\nto keep these disturbances to a minimum. One can\nalso attempt to isolate the experimental payload from\nthe rest of the space vehicle by active damping. This\napproach is being taken in the ISS with the so-called\nARIS system. Finally, one can cope with the unavo-\nidable remaining disturbances by clever scheduling\n(\u201ctimelining\u201d) so that they do not unnecessarily\ndisrupt the experiments.\n\n7.5.1.2 Causes\n\nAfter clarifying the origin of microgravity, it remains\nto discuss the question of why materials science experi-\nments benefit from the microgravity environment and\nto what extent time-dependent and time-independent\nresidual gravity can be tolerated.\n\nFirst of all, it should be clear that the influence of\ngravity can be ignored for a solid body at rest, since\nits inner structure and outer form are primarily influ-\nenced by Coulomb forces. This is true independent\nof the form of atomic binding, for example covalent,\nionic or metallic. The influence of gravity on gases is\nexpressed, for example, in the barometric altitude\nformula. However, thermal fluctuations in gases are\nusually so strong that they conceal the influence of\ngravity over short distances (and for brief times). The\nliquid state is the most sensitive to gravity influences.\nThis is because, in contrast to a solid, they have a free\nsurface and cannot sustain shear forces. Therefore,\nmost materials science experiments under microgra-\nvity conditions concentrate on the liquid and (to a\nlesser extent) gaseous states.\n\nUnder weightless conditions there is neither an up\nnor a down, neither heaviness nor lightness. A weightless\ndrop of liquid remains in position and does not flow;\nit is therefore not necessary to store it in a container.\nIn particular, weightlessness means that the following\nphysical effects do not occur in the fluid states:*\n\ne Buoyancy\ne Sedimentation\ne Convection.\n\n> In thermodynamics one subsumes the liquid and gaseous\n\nstates under the term fluid state.\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\n40000\nry\n2\n1000\n3\n&\n8 100\ncs}\noO\n3\n>\nB10\no\nac\n16\n0.01 0.4 1 40 100. 1000\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nFigure 7.5.3: Allowable microgravity disturbance on the ISS.\n\nBy buoyancy is meant the upward motion of the lighter\ncomponents in a liquid mixture, by sedimentation the\ndownward motion of the heavy components.

However, an estimate of the\nallowable amplitude of disturbances as a function\nof their frequency is possible with the help of the\nNavier-Stokes equation, which describes the ma-\ncroscopic behavior of fluid systems in the context of\nhydrodynamics.

Some of them have already\nbeen carried out, others are planned.\n\n7.5.2 Critical Phenomena\n\nMatter can exist in various aggregate conditions\nand phases. By changing external thermodynamic\nvariables such as pressure and temperature, one can\ntransform such a system from one phase to another.\nThis process is called a phase transition. Examples are\nthe transition from a solid to a liquid state (melting),\nfrom the liquid to the gaseous state (evaporation),\nfrom an ordered to an unordered solid state, from\na magnetic to a nonmagnetic state, etc. Ehrenfest\nclassified phase transitions by the discontinuities in\nthe thermodynamic variables which change at a phase\ntransition. For a first-order phase transition it is the\nthermodynamic variables themselves, for example the\ndensity at the solid\u2014liquid phase transition. In second-\norder phase transitions the variables themselves are\ncontinuous but their derivatives diverge. For example,\nthe magnetization of ferromagnetic phase transitions\nchanges continuously (from zero to a finite value), but\nthe susceptibility, y= AM/0H, diverges as a function\nof temperature. Second-order phase transitions are\ncharacterized by a critical point in phase space. Only\nwhen all state variables are at their critical value is it\na case of a second-order phase transition. For a fluid\nsystem the critical point is defined by the critical\ntemperature T. and the critical density 9...\n\nHow individual thermodynamic values and their\nderivatives behave near a critical point can be described\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:595\n\n595\n\nby the so-called critical exponents. If A is such a value\nand t = (T \u2014 T.)/T,, the dimensionless temperature,\nthen the corresponding critical exponent a is defined\nas follows:\n\nA=1t%\nIT30\n\n(7.5.8)\n\nThe critical exponents do not just describe the behavior\nof individual values as they approach the critical point.\nThere are also relationships between the individual\ncritical exponents, so-called scaling laws. K. Wilson\nreceived the Nobel Prize in 1982 for confirming these\nscaling laws in the context of renormalization group\ntheory.\n\nThe value of individual critical exponents is very\ndifficult to calculate by theory. Different theories pro-\nduce different values. It is also not clear how closely\none must approach the critical point for Equation\n7.5.8 to be valid, and what influence a finite system size\nhas. Therefore, experimental determination of these\nexponents is extremely important. Under terrestrial\nconditions there is a difficulty with fluid systems:\nwhereas the critical temperature can in principle be\nadjusted as precisely as desired, this is not the case\nfor the density. Because of gravity the density at the\nbottom of the container will always be higher than\nnear the top, and the critical density will only be found\nin an infinitely thin layer perpendicular to the force\nof gravity. The volume of fluid at the critical point is\ntherefore minuscule compared to the total volume,\nand the anticipated critical behavior is masked by the\nnoncritical behavior of the rest of the system. Here is\na role for microgravity, since density stratification\ndoes not occur there and the entire volume can thus\nassume the critical value for density.\n\nExperiments on critical phenomena have been\nconducted under microgravity conditions and more\nare being planned. Thus the specific heat \u00a2, = (0Q/0T),\nof SF, has been measured. The specific heat shows only\na very weak (logarithmic) singularity; therefore its\ncritical exponent is almost zero and hardly measurable\nwith conventional methods.\n\nIn addition to classical systems, quantum systems\nare also of considerable interest. Thus the specific heat\nof \u201cHe along the A line of the phase transition from\nthe normal to the superfluid condition was measured\nwith great precision (Figure 7.5.4).

Bose-Einstein\ncondensation only occurs in the absence of external\nfields, including gravity, and can therefore be optimally\nobserved under microgravity conditions for systems\nhaving mass.\n\n7.5.3 Fluid Physics\n\n7.5.3.1 Statics\n\nNaturally enough, the behavior of liquids in a reduced\ngravity field is one of the central topics of materials\nscience research under microgravity conditions. First\nof all there are questions about the form of equilib-\nrium in liquid volumes and its stability. Here gravity\nis in competition with surface tension. While for the\nlatter there is a tendency to minimize surface (relative\nto volume), leading to curved surfaces, in the volume\nofa liquid there is a tendency to minimize its potential\nenergy in the gravity field, leading to the formation\nof flat surfaces as a response to the flat equipotential\nlines of terrestrial gravitation. The precise form of the\n\nBose statistics are valid for particles with integer spin and\nallow several particles to exist in the same quantum state.\nThis is to be contrasted with Fermi statistics, valid for\nparticles with half-integer spin, in which case this is not\npossible because of the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nsurface is a compromise between these two conflicting\nprinciples and can be calculated using differential\ngeometry. Qualitatively these effects can be discussed\nwith the help of capillary length, which describes the\nrelationship between surface energy and potential\nenergy in a (constant) gravity field:\n\n(7.5.9)\n\nwhere:\n\ny= surface tension,\n\np= density,\n\ng= acceleration due to gravity.\n\nIf the capillary length is short relative to a typical\nsystem\u2019s dimension, then the influence of gravity\ndominates and one has flat surfaces. If it is large, then\nthe influence of the surface tension is dominant and\none has curved surfaces.\n\nAn interesting question concerns the stability of\nvarious liquid forms. The stability of a liquid bridge\nsuspended between two concentric disks has been\na matter of intensive investigation. Under weight-\nless conditions, namely for infinite capillary length,\nthe theory predicts the collapse of the liquid bridge\nas soon as its diameter is exceeded by the distance\nbetween the separating disks. This so-called Laplace\ninstability can only be studied in its pure form under\nmicrogravity.\n\n7.5.3.2 Dynamics\n\nBesides these static effects there are dynamic phe-\nnomena which are the subject of hydrodynamic\ninvestigations under microgravity, including primarily\nconvection. As already mentioned above, buoyancy\nconvection isa result of the interaction of temperature\ngradients and gravity. Most bodies expand when they\nare heated; that is, they possess a positive thermal\nexpansion coefficient. The consequence is that warmer\nliquids in a gravity field rise, whereas colder liquids\nsink. If a liquid is heated from below (as on a stove\nhotplate), flow or buoyancy convection occurs as\nsoon as a critical value in the temperature gradient is\nexceeded. The geometry of the convection cell depends\non the geometry of the entire system and changes\nwith increasing temperature gradients until there\n\n2/24/09 2:41:21 PM\n",

The characteristic\nquantity for describing buoyancy convection is the\ndimensionless Rayleigh number:\n\npa L SVT d\u2018\nKn\n\n(7.5.10)\n\nwhere:\n= thermal coefficient of expansion,\nVT = temperature gradient,\nx= temperature conductivity,\n7 = viscosity,\nd= typical system length.\nIn the case of unstable layering, if the Rayleigh number\nexceeds a critical value Ra,, then convection begins.\nIn the case of stable layering (heating from above)\nthere is no convection. In the case of a radial tempe-\nrature gradient (perpendicular to the force of gravity),\nthen convection is initiated in all temperature gradients,\nno matter how small; the critical Rayleigh number\nis zero for this configuration. Because the Rayleigh\nnumber contains the value for the acceleration due to\ngravity, when it is changed then the threshold for the\ninitiation of buoyancy convection accordingly changes,\nso the stability range of the instable layering can be\nconsiderably increased under microgravity.\nConvection is a very efficient mechanism for\ntransporting mass and heat in liquids. Only if it is\nsuppressed is it possible to study other, weaker effects\nwhich are otherwise masked by the buoyancy convec-\ntion. One of these effects is Marangoni convection,\nwhich was discovered at the beginning of the twen-\ntieth century but experienced a renaissance thanks to\nmaterials science experiments under weightlessness.\nIn contrast to buoyancy convection it has its origin\nnot in the temperature dependence of density, but in\nthe temperature dependence of surface tension.\u2019 As\na rule, surface tension increases as the temperature\ndrops, therefore surfaces tend to arch more at cold\nlocations than warm ones where the capillary length\nis smaller.\nThis leads to flow along the surface from warm\nto cold. Because the mass must be conserved, this\nflow has to be compensated within the liquid and\n\n> Or, more precisely, in the spatial dependence of the surface\n\ntension, which may be due to temperature or concentration\ngradients along the surface.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:597\n\n597\n\nconvection cells are accordingly formed. Marangoni\nconvection is independent of gravity. Since it has\nthe same appearance as buoyancy convection, it can\nbest be studied when the latter is suppressed by not\nexceeding the critical Rayleigh number, which can be\naccomplished by reducing gravity.\n\nBesides liquids, other fluid systems have also been\ninvestigated under microgravity conditions. A par-\nticularly active field is combustion research. In an\nordinary flame, but also during the combustion of\nfuel mixtures in motors, convection is the significant\nmechanism for mass and heat transport. Diffusion\nprocesses also play an important role, and these can\nonly be studied if convection is suppressed. It was\noriginally not known whether a flame would also\nburn under microgravity conditions; that is, whether\nthe diffusion processes are sufficient for supplying\nthe flame with oxygen and removing combustion\nproducts such as soot. Indeed, a candle burns under\nmicrogravity with a bluish, spherical flame.\n\nCombustion research under microgravity condi-\ntions is not only undertaken to investigate aspects of\nbasic and applied research to improve efficiencies; the\nsafety aspects of fighting fires in a space vehicle, such\nas the ISS, also play a role.\n\n7.5.3.3 Soft Matter\n\nAmong the fluid systems one also has to count other\nforms of soft matter like colloids, granular media,\naerogels, aerosols, complex plasmas and cold atoms.\nThey too are a subject of materials science research\nunder microgravity conditions.\n\nSo-called plasma crystals are a spectacular result\nof this research. If one puts an electric charge on\ndust particles in a plasma at sufficiently low tem-\nperature, they align themselves in a regular crystal\nlattice, forming a plasma crystal. But on Earth these\ndust particles sediment; one can at best achieve a\ntwo-dimensional plasma crystal. Under microgravity\nconditions, however, the weight of the dust particles\nis irrelevant and a perfect three-dimensional crystal\nforms (Figure 7.5.5). In contrast to a crystalline solid\nwhich is composed of atoms, the length scale is larger\nby a factor of 10\u2018 (a dust particle is about 11m in\ndiameter, an atom about 1 A), which means that one\ncan observe the equivalent of atomic processes with\n\n2/24/09 2:41:21 PM\n",

Thus the melting and solidification\nprocess of a plasma crystal could be observed and\nthe structure and frequency of lattice vibration could\nbe measured.\n\nThe term cold atoms refers to atoms from which\nkinetic energy has been removed. They move corre-\nspondingly slowly. In a dilute gas of cold atoms they\nhardly collide. Their free path length has a macroscopic\ndimension and they move in a ballistic trajectory in\nresponse to gravity. If one injects cold atoms into a\nresonator, one can construct highly precise atomic\nclocks with them by using their resonance frequency\nas frequency norm. The residence time of the atoms\nin the resonator determines the quality of the time\nsignal. Since atoms also react to gravity, their residence\ntime in the resonator depends on the level of ambient\ngravity. Therefore, these clocks function best under\nmicrogravity conditions.\n\n7.5.4 Solidification\n\nThe first-order phase transition from a liquid to a\nsolid state is called solidification. It is of great tech-\nnological significance since most raw materials are\nobtained from the liquid state. In the semiconductor\nindustry and in optoelectronics it is essential to obtain\nfrom the melt, or sometimes from the gaseous state,\nsingle crystals which are as perfect as possible. In this\ncontext one speaks of crystal growth. Many metallic\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nend and semifinished products are cast or molded; the\nsolidification of metals is thus an important topic.\n\nIn solidification it is important that the melt in\nfront of the solid\u2014liquid phase boundary, the solidifi-\ncation front, be as homogeneous as possible, because\nany kind of inhomogeneity at the solidification front\nwould leave its traces in the solid. This refers to both\ntemperature and concentration gradients. If con-\nvection cells are present, be they stationary or time\ndependent, this homogeneity is no longer assured.\nPerfect single crystals can best be grown under purely\ndiffusive conditions, that is in the absence of any\nflow. Microgravity offers optimal conditions for the\npurpose.\n\n7.5.4.1 Crystal Growth\n\nCrystals only grow if there is a driving force, namely\na temperature and/or concentration gradient. Under\nmicrogravity conditions the Rayleigh number can be\nkept below its critical value so that these gradients\ndo not lead to the formation of convection cells.\nHowever, free surfaces must also be avoided during\nconvection-free crystal growth, since Marangoni\nconvection would otherwise be inevitable. In the\nfloating-zone process, which is common for semi-\nconductor crystal growth, this is not the case. In this\nprocess a polycrystalline, cylindrical work piece is\ndrawn through a narrow heating zone, melted and\nrecrystallized. In the heating zone a free liquid surface\nis formed which leads to Marangoni convection. By\ncoating the work piece with a thin layer, usually con-\nsisting of a high-melting oxide of the source material,\nthe free surface and thus Marangoni convection can\nbe avoided.\n\nA special case of crystal growth under micro-\ngravity conditions is protein crystal growth. Large\nprotein crystals are required for structural analysis\nby neutron scattering. The crystalline structure of\nprotein crystals is quite complex; that is, the unit\ncrystal cell from which the crystal built is relatively\nlarge. Under terrestrial conditions the protein crystal\nis deformed by its own weight while it grows and the\nregular structure essential for structural analysis is\ninterrupted. Under microgravity conditions it was\npossible to grow protein crystals superior in size and\nperfection to those grown on Earth.\n\n2/24/09 2:41:22 PM\n",
    "620": "7.5 Materials Science\n\n7.5.4.2 Directional Solidification\n\nThe Bridgman process is the most common process\nfor so-called directional solidification in which the\nsolidification front is forced in a particular direction\nby an imposed temperature gradient. Here the poly-\ncrystalline material is placed in a cartridge which\nmoves relative to two heating elements which generate\na linear temperature profile. The solidification front\nis where the temperature is just equal to the melting\npoint of the material. The optimal arrangement is\nthe vertical Bridgman process in which the tempe-\nrature gradient is exactly opposed (antiparallel) to\nthe force of gravity, where there is stable layering. If\nradial temperature gradients could be avoided, then\nthis arrangement would be free of convection even\nunder terrestrial conditions. But if one is dealing\nwith alloys in which concentration gradients as well\nas temperature gradients play a role, a situation can\narise in which there is no stable layering. In this case\nan analysis of buoyancy convection must consider the\nconcentration dependence of the density. In addition\nto the thermal expansion d/dT, the concentration\ndependence of the density do/dc, plays a role. If both\nderivatives are of opposite sign, then stable layering is\nimpossible and thermosolutal (buoyancy) convection\ntakes place. Here the only remedy is microgravity.\n\n7.5.4.3 Metals\n\nAmong metallic systems, the so-called monotectics\ndeserve special attention. These are systems in which\nthere are miscibility gaps in the liquid phase; that is, at\nparticular temperatures and concentrations they sepa-\nrate into two immiscible liquid phases (Figure 7.5.6).\nA prominent example is Al-Pb. Such systems are, in\nprinciple, of considerable technical interest. If it were\npossible to finely disperse the two immiscible liquid\nphases and solidify them in that condition, then one\ncould produce an ideal, self-lubricating material for\nbearings, whereby the hard phase takes over the sup-\nport function and the soft phase the lubrication. This\nis of course not possible on Earth because the two\nseparated phases segregate according to their differing\ndensities; that is, the heavy lead sinks and the light\naluminum floats to the top. It was hoped that under\nmicrogravity conditions this effect would not exist\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:599\n\n599\n\nFigure 7.5.6: Polished section of an (almost) completely separated\nCuCo alloy. The light regions are rich in copper, the dark ones rich\nin cobalt (Source: DLR).\n\nand a fine dispersion could be produced. But, as in the\ncase of Marangoni convection, surface tension is again\nthe spoilsport. A fine dispersion of liquid droplets of\nthe one component in the liquid matrix of the other\ncomponent has a large interface which contributes to\nthe total energy of the system because the boundary\nsurface energy between both liquids is retained. This\nenergy is reduced by the coagulation of many small\nroplets into a larger one. Therefore, the equilibrium\nconfiguration consists of a large drop of liquid sur-\nrounded by the second liquid. Which of the two liquids\nis on the outside or inside depends on which of the two\noes a better job of wetting the container. One way to\navoid this undesirable result is to quench the two-phase\njisassociated liquid melt before coagulation begins.\n\n7.5.4.4 Undercooling\n\nThe cases discussed so far dealt with solidification near\nthermodynamic equilibrium. But since solidification\nis a first-order phase transition, the onset of the solid\nphase requires a critical nucleus. If it is possible to\nsuppress or at least delay nucleation, then it is possible\nto cool the melt below its freezing point without soli-\ndification. The result is undercooling. This metastable\ncondition of an undercooled melt and its solidification\n\n2/24/09 2:41:23 PM\n",
    "621": "CHO7.indd Sec1:600\n\n600\n\nis another fascinating field of materials science research\nunder microgravity conditions. Here it is first neces-\nsary to achieve an undercooled condition and then to\nmaintain it for a time. This means reducing the rate\nof nucleation. Besides the unavoidable homogeneous\nnucleation which is intrinsic to any system, there is\nalso so-called heterogeneous nucleation, which is\nresponsible for initiating solidification. Impurities\nand crystalline structures, as found for example on\ncrucible walls, act as heterogeneous nuclei. Although\nthe number of heterogeneous nuclei in a melt is much\nlower than the number of homogeneous nuclei, it is\nheterogeneous nucleation which prompts solidifica-\ntion. In order to study undercooling, undercooled mel-\ntsand their solidification, containerless processes have\nbeen developed in which the melt can be positioned\nand processed without contact with a crucible. Levita-\ntion melting, in particular electromagnetic levitation,\nis one of these processes. Electrically conductive samp-\nles are caused to levitate by means of a high-frequency\nspatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic field and\nare then melted. The Lorentz forces act as a levitation\nforce and the ohmic losses of the turbulent flow induced\nin the sample provide the heat. This process is routine\nunder terrestrial conditions and allows undercooling\nof several hundred degrees over long intervals (minutes\nto hours). As a consequence of magnetohydrodynamic\ninteractions the induced flows also lead to convection\nand sometimes to turbulent flow in the sample. Under\nmicrogravity conditions the positioning field can be\nreduced because it no longer has to levitate the sample\nbut only stabilize it against the residual gravity. This in\nturn greatly reduces flow in the sample.\n\nAn undercooled melt is far from a condition of\nequilibrium. Its rate of solidification increases as\nthe undercooling progresses. There are a number of\ntheoretical predictions for the precise functional rela-\ntionship between solidification rate and undercooling.\nExperimental confirmation requires a convection-free\nundercooled melt, something that in the ideal case can\nonly be managed under microgravity conditions.\n\nIf the solidification of an undercooled melt has\nalready begun, then the system is in a paradoxical situ-\nation: the solidified solid is warmer than the melt which\nsurrounds it. To achieve equilibrium, the solid must\ngive up heat to the melt. This is most successful if the\ninterface to the melt, the solidification front, is increased.\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nke\n\nFigure 7.5.7: Polished section of a dendritically solidified alloy\n(Source: DLR).\n\nMorphological instability is the result, namely a tran-\nsition or mushy zone is formed, in which dendrites\u00ae\narise (see Figure 7.5.7). Dendrites are fractal structures\nwith a very large surface. Their form and growth can be\ntheoretically calculated. For experimental confirmation\nit is important that convection either be suppressed or\nits influence be taken into account mathematically.\nAnother feature of solidification from undercooled\nmelts is the fact that the phase diagram describing the\nexistence range of the solid and liquid equilibrium\nphases is no longer valid. In the case of nonequilib-\nrium solidification, metastable solid phases can arise\nif their growth rate is higher than the growth rate of\nthe equivalent equilibrium phase. By means of phase\nselection, solids can be produced which have different\ncharacteristics than they would have if produced by\n\n\u00ae A dendrite hasa treelike structure, from the Greek 8 evdpov,\n\na tree.\n\n2/24/09 2:41:24 PM\n",

In many cases\nthese measurements are only possible under microgra-\nvity; in other cases measurements under microgravity\nimprove accuracy.\n\nSpecifically, measurement of the following values\nis discussed:\ne Density p\n\u00b0 Specific heat \u00a2,\ne Viscosity 77\ne Surface tension v\ne Electrical conductivity o\ne Heat conductivity 2\ne Diffusion D\ne Soret coefficient S.\n\nExperiments under microgravity have been conducted\nona large number of different materials under various\nconditions. These include aqueous solutions, melts\nof oxide glasses, high-temperature-fused salt baths,\ncritical and supercritical fluids, and liquid semicon-\nductors and metals. This section concentrates on\nliquid metals and semiconductors, primarily because\nof their technological relevance.\n\n7.5.5.1 Measurements in Cartridges\n\nMeasuring Heat Conductivity\n\nThe heat conductivity of InSb was measured during\nthe TEXUS-24 mission with the transient hot wire\nmethod. A short electrical impulse is sent through a\nthin wire located in the center of a cylinder (in this case\nfilled with InSb). At the cylinder wall the temperature\nincrease is measured as a function of time. If the heat is\nonly transferred by conductivity, then the heat conduc-\ntivity can be calculated from the signal as follows:\n\n_Q a7)\n\n= (7.5.11)\n2a d(Int)\n\nwith Q the emitted amount of heat.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:601\n\n601\n\nThe advantage of the procedure is that the\nconvective contribution to the heat transport is noti-\nceable as a deviation from the linearity of the quotient\nd(AT)/d(In #). Under conditions of microgravity the\nentire range is linear, so the above quotient can be\ndetermined with high precision.\n\nMeasuring Self-diffusion and Interdiffusion\nDuring the Spacelab missions (FSLP, D1 and D2)\nthe self-diffusion and interdiffusion of several liquid\nmetals like Sn, Pb, In and Sb were investigated. Also\nfor these experiments it was essential that convection\nbe avoided. The astonishing result was that the tem-\nperature dependence of the diffusion constants does\nnot follow an exponential Arrhenius law, but can be\ndescribed by a quadratic relationship:\n\nD=AT?\n\n(7.5.12)\nSuch temperature dependence is theoretically pre-\ndicted, but it conflicts with the widespread (prejudiced)\nopinion that diffusion is an activated process. In the\ncontext of the MSL-1 mission, a Japanese team repea-\nted the experiments with tin. Their results confirm the\npower law behavior of diffusion, but with an exponent\nof 1.8.\n\nMeasuring the Soret Effect\n\nThe transport equations of linear irreversible ther-\nmodynamics predict that there are also nondiagonal\nOnsager coefficients, which link mass flows j. with\ntemperature gradients VT. This coefficient is called the\nSoret coefficient S and is defined by the equation\nje=-SVT (7.5.13)\nFor the cobalt-in-tin system, this coefficient was deter-\nmined during the Spacelab missions FSLP and D1. In\ncontrast to terrestrial measurements in which convec-\ntion destroys the developing concentration gradient,\nthe Soret effect is clearly perceptible and the Soret\ncoefficient can be determined with high precision.\n\n7.5.5.2 Containerless Experiments\n\nContact-free measurements of thermophysical pro-\nperties under weightlessness became possible with\n\n2/24/09 2:41:27 PM\n",

The strong levitation field required in\nterrestrial experiments leads to a deformation of the\ndroplet and splitting and shift of the stated frequency.\nThe surface tension of a congruently melting Aus.Cuyy\nalloy was measured during the IML-2 mission under\nmicrogravity conditions.\n\nViscosity cannot be measured contact-free on\nEarth, because the levitation field generates turbulent\nflows in the specimen which hide the damping of\nsurface vibrations by the viscosity. However, it was\npossible to measure the viscosity from the damping\nof surface vibrations during the MSL-1 mission. The\nexperiments were carried out using the eutectic alloy\nPd, ,Cu,Sits.\n\nElectrical Conductivity\n\nThe measurement principle is based on the fact that\nthe levitated droplet is part of the oscillating circuit\nwhich supplies power for the levitation coil.

The precondition\nis that the heat balance is precisely known, which\nmeans that the heat input and output must be exactly\nmeasured.

Seen with today\u2019s eyes, those\nplans need to be supplemented with a look at the\nproblems associated with permanent colonization\nof the Moon and with a human mission to Mars.\nThis means to consider stay-times in space which are\nmeasured in years, which gives rise to significant and\nin some cases entirely new demands. Disregarding\nthe very high financial expense, and not mentioning\nthe technical difficulties, very thorough cost-benefit\nassessments would be required to convince the public\nof the relevance of such an endeavor. So far, the cost\u2014\nbenefit analyses have made sense in terms of value\nreceived. In this context just the one example of the\nscientific yield for astronomy of the Hubble Space\nTelescope should be mentioned, which helped to\nrevolutionize basic astronomical conceptions. The\nHubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990 but\nafter three years had to be modified by astronauts\nduring extravehicular activities to eliminate an optical\ndefect. In 1998 it was again serviced by astronauts. In\n2008 it is actually due to be decommissioned, unless\nanother service mission is undertaken. In the meantime\nNASA has approved such a mission. This example may\nillustrate how important a human presence is in space.\nIn this chapter the emphasis will be on the problems\nconnected with very long human missions, extending\nbeyond the ISS.\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 7.6.1, there is a rather\ngood database for approximately the first 30 days of\nhabitation in space.\n\nIn the meantime we know from numerous inves-\ntigations how the physiological progression of various\nprocesses takes place during this phase, for example\nin the cardiovascular system and the thermoregula-\ntory system and concerning the salt/water balance.\nAfterward, a stable equilibrium is reached after about\nsix weeks (Figure 7.6.2).\n\nHowever, because of the scarce amount of relevant\ndata we know relatively little about the muscle and\nskeletal system during long periods in space, and this\ndespite the fact that for very long stays of humans in\nspace it will likely play a significant role. The same\nis true for long-term effects of increased radiation\nexposure in space.

Median flight length\nis only 10 days (Source: [7.6.3]).\n\nother human organ systems after reentry in Earth\u2019s\ngravitation field are also open questions. And it can\nbe expected that during long flights in space, psycho-\nphysiological problems and interpersonal conflicts\nwill be an increasing problem. A number of stress\nfactors affect humans in space, including on the\none hand isolation, confinement, lack of sources of\nstimuli, dependence on technical systems and lack\nof comfort, and on the other hand individual (lack\nof privacy, separation from family members, stress\nmanagement, motivation, etc.) and interpersonal\n(territorial and dominance behavior, group struc-\ntures, group thinking, group dynamics) conflicts, but\nalso the leveling of circadian, lunar, circa lunar and\nannular endogenous rhythms. During long flights in\nspace these changes are combined with an increasing\nfeeling of monotony the longer the flight lasts. All\nthese factors contribute to making a long-duration\nflight in space, even after years of training, an unusual\nburden for astronauts that is far beyond their range\nof experience on Earth.\n\n7.6.2 Mission Scenarios\n\nHuman exploration of space requires that the health\nand performance of astronauts be assured in different\nmission scenarios:\n\n2/24/09 2:41:37 PM\n",

An astronaut requires an average of six weeks to reach a point of adjustment at which\nthere is at least partial adaptation to the new environment (Source: [7.6.15]).\n\nIn near-Earth orbits (ISS, low Earth orbit \u2014- LEO)\nDuring an interplanetary flight (transit)\n\nOn the Moon\n\nOn Mars.\n\nBene\n\n7 On the basis of these scenarios, the following parame-\nters can be identified which fundamentally influence\nthe mission and which must be taken into account\nto varying extents depending on the nature of the\nparticular mission:\n\n(a) Distance from the Earth\n\n(b) Changes in g-forces (10\u00b0g in LEO, 0g during an\ninterplanetary transit, 0.16g on the Moon, 0.38g\non Mars), as well as\n\n(c) The probable duration of a mission.\n\nThese mission scenarios lead to various load profiles\nrelated to health, safety and the well-being of the crew.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:608 &\n\nIn addition, they significantly influence operational\n\nplanning and technological issues down to the\n\nconstruction and design of the requisite space vehicles\nor planetary space stations (habitat) [7.6.1], [7.6.2].

Finally, the radiation risk in scenarios 2 to 4 sub-\nstantially increases without appropriate shielding\nmeasures.\n\n7.6.3 Experience to Date\n\nSo far, about 460 people have been in space, most of\nthem male astronauts; the female proportion is only\nabout 10%. The cumulative flight time is about 80\nyears (as of August 2007). The frequency and length\nof human flights in space (Figure 7.6.1) point out\nthe noteworthy fact that the median flight duration\nis only 10 days. Until 2003 only about 40 astronauts\nhad flight experience longer than six months, and\nonly four people were in space longer than one year\n[7.6.3]. The record for the longest continuous pre-\nsence in space is still held by the Russian physician\nDr. Valeri Polyakov who flew for 437 days on the MIR\nstation from 1994 to 1995. The cumulative records\nare also held by Russian cosmonauts, namely Valeri\nPolyakov (679 days, two flights) and Sergei Avdeyev\n(748 days, three flights). Experience in space is al-\nways supplemented with accompanying terrestrial\nstudies, something which often passes unnoted.\nThese studies have always been a major component\nof space medicine and it can be safely assumed that\ntheir significance will increase for the planning and\nexecution of future long flights into space.\n\nIt should be emphasized here that the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) critically analyzed at an early date\nthe various medical, physiological, psychological,\nsocial, and technical problems which could play a\nrole during lengthy human presence in space. This\nsubject has been exhaustively treated in ESA studies,\nat special meetings and in numerous technical reports\n[7.6.4], [7.6.5], [7.6.6], [7.6.7]. In this context one also\nspeaks of the human factor which must be considered\nin human missions. By definition, studies of the\nhuman factor are an interdisciplinary research field\nwhich integrates insights from medicine, physiology,\npsychology, sociology, biomechanics, engineering\nand other disciplines, and complements them with\nhabitability studies. These studies concern human\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:609\n\n609\n\nabilities and maximum potentials. They undergird\nthe design of equipment (ergonomics), machines,\nsystems, workflows, tasks, and ambience so that peo-\nple find them as safe, comfortable and effective as\npossible. Because the necessary information cannot\nbe adequately appreciated and dealt with only on the\nbasis of theoretical considerations, ESA, for example,\nestablished the interdisciplinary Simulation Mission\nStudy Group (SIMIS) several years ago. It was the task\nof this working group to identify simulation facilities\n(pressurized diving chambers, submarine stations,\nbunkers, etc.) or other isolated places on Earth where\npeople in small groups can live together to simulate\nthe living quarters of long-duration flights in space.\nIt turned out that polar stations, underwater research\nstations, hyperbaric and hypobaric chambers, bed-rest\nfacilities, submarines, immersion facilities, parabolic\nflights and mock-ups (habitability test bed) all can\nserve as reasonably analogous environments. In the\nmeantime ESA has conducted numerous isolation\nand confinement studies, and results are available\nfrom simulation studies making use of various faci-\nlities with different crew compositions and crew sizes\n(ESA reports: POLAREMSI, ANTEMSI, HYDREMSI,\nISEMSI, EXEMSI, HUBES, SFINCSS). They make\nfar-reaching recommendations on planning and con-\nducting long-duration missions from medical, psy-\nchological and technical perspectives [7.6.4], [7.6.5],\n7.6.6], [7.6.7]. These terrestrial simulation studies\nwill continue to be a significant element of all future\nspace missions.\n\nIt is astonishing that there is hardly any data availa-\nble from the field of clinical medicine, specifically\non problems related to isolation and confinement,\nalthough similar problems must arise in cases of long-\nterm immobility (fractures), for example. A current\nexample for the clinical relevance of results from such\nsimulation studies are the findings of Heer [7.6.8] and\nTitze [7.6.9], who could prove that the human body\ncan store osmotically inactive sodium. This offered a\ncompletely new perspective on the endemic disease of\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension). It was significant\nthat the discrete retention of salt was only noted after\nobservation periods of three to eight weeks. Short-\nterm observation periods of three to five days were\ninadequate to reveal this effect. In the meantime it was\nexperimentally shown that the surface tissues (cutis\n\n2/24/09 2:41:38 PM\n",
    "631": "CHO7.indd Sec1:610\n\n610\n\nand subcutis) play a central role in the osmotically\ninactive storage of sodium.\nAlso, as mentioned above, problems of isolation\nand confinement have been the subject of intensive\nresearch in space medicine for years and are leading\nto results that could easily be relevant for clinical\nproblems, considering that almost half of the popula-\ntion in industrialized countries lives in single-person\nhouseholds, either by necessity (sickness) or volunta-\nrily (singles). Here, too, medical, physiological space\nresearch on humans is setting the pace in describing\nthe physiological phenomena and pathophysiological\nchanges which arise. Furthermore, a methodological\nrepertoire from space research is made available\nwhich can later find practical application in clinical\nmedicine, such as noninvasive technologies, telemetric\ntransmission and real-time data analysis programs.\n\n7.6.4 Environmental Parameters\n\nTable 7.6.1 lists a number of life support systems\nin space (LSS) which have been developed on the\nground and only in some cases tested under weight-\nless conditions. All these systems have a protective\ncomponent in that they, for example, remove CO,\nor produce O, [7.6.10]. At the same time they have\na life support component since they are supposed\nto provide energy-rich substrates for consumption.\nAs can be seen from the designations in Table 7.6.1,\nthey vary in nature according to the purpose they are\nsupposed to fulfill in space.\n\nBioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs), if\nthey are to fulfill their purpose, depend on the photo-\nsynthetic activity of green plants, which in the presence\n\nTable 7.6.1: Life support systems in space.\n\nClosed Equiliberated Biological Aquatic System\nBioregenerative Life Support System\nAtmosphere Revitalization Subsystems\n\nEnvironmental Control and Life Support System\n(Space Shuttle)\n\nEnvironmental Control System\nControlled Ecological Life Support Systems\nClosed Ecology Experiment Facility\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nof light convert CO, and water into carbohydrates and\noxygen, providing chemical energy. In order to be fully\neffective, in addition to sufficient concentrations of\nCO, and O, in the ambient air and the right humi-\ndity, temperature and barometric pressure, light of a\nsuitable wavelength must also be available, all of which\nposes difficulties in space. The circadian and seasonal\nrhythms of plants must also be taken into account.\nCultivation in these artificial systems is usually in the\nform of monocultures, so the plants lack a natural\nsocial milieu (biotope), which, as is sufficiently well\nknown from terrestrial experience, involves risks.\n\nThe lack of gravity is the biggest disadvantage,\nbecause all systems developed to date use gravitropic\nland plants. These do not prosper under weightless-\nness, if they grow at all, and do not produce edible\nfruits. The cause is likely the lack of thermal convec-\ntion around plants growing under weightlessness. For\nthis reason, the CEBAS system, among others, was\ndeveloped, which produces biomass in an aquatic\nmilieu using nongravitropic plants and can provide\nanimal protein as well as plant material [7.6.10].\nDespite all these problems, such systems have to be\nfurther developed until satisfactory solutions are\nfound. Self-contained, completely closed systems\nwhich can be harvested will probably not exist for the\ntime being; in most cases something has to be either\nadded to the system somewhere or removed from\nsomewhere else. The systems are semi-open, which\nmeans it costs energy to maintain them. One can,\nhowever, develop energy-saving concepts for them.\nFrom the perspective of physiologists and medical\ndoctors it should also be noted that for long-term\npresence in space a good variety of energy producers\nand protein-rich nourishment to guard against a\ncertain monotony in diet must be assured. Otherwise,\ndietary deficiencies and malnutrition can be expected\nin the long term.\n\n7.6.5 Medical Physiological Problems\nArising from Residence in Space\n\nVarious authors [7.6.3], [7.6.11], [7.6.12] have sum-\nmarized the most relevant medical physiological ex-\nperience, problems and risks that have become known\nin the course of US and Russian short- and long-term\n\n2/24/09 2:41:39 PM\n",

[7.6.11]\nand Cl\u00e9ment [7.6.3], considerable attention is given\nto psychological problems which reduce the mental\nperformance, ability to concentrate, psychic stability\nand resilience of astronauts (asthenia, stress, fear,\nnervousness, depression, etc.). The entire spectrum\nof possible problems is probably still not yet covered.\nComet [7.6.7] has identified the following research\nareas which in the future will definitely require more\nwork before a human flight to Mars lasting 500 to\n1000 days can be considered. These include the per-\nformance of the cardiovascular, immune, muscle and\nskeletal systems, nutrition under complete weightless-\nness (0-0.1g), changing gravity loads (1/10g, 3/10g,\n5/10g, 8/10g), toxicological and pharmacological\nkinetic studies under weightless conditions, studies on\nthe occurrence of kidney stones caused by accelerated\nbone reduction in space, the dynamics of healing pro-\ncesses, as well as research on the influence of various\ntypes of artificial gravity on the human, animal and\nplant organism.\n\n7.6.5.1 Changes in Body Composition\n\nLiquids and electrolytes, fat-free mass (muscle\nmass), fat, and bone mass all undergo considerable\nchanges during the first six weeks under simulated\n(terrestrial isolation studies) and actual weightless\nconditions [7.6.13], [7.6.14]. Biochemical equip-\nment and technologies must be available on-board\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:611\n\n611\n\nto identify these bodily changes. If changes occur,\nthen this data is important for planning and initi-\nating special treatment, for example as counterme-\nasures in the case of progressive loss of bone mass\nduring a space flight, such as intensified exercise\non a vibration platform or training exercises with a\nflywheel ergometer.\n\n7.6.5.2 Cardiovascular System\n\nIt has been confirmed in several studies that the\ncardiovascular system undergoes rapid changes\nduring presence in LEO, on short-term (Space Shuttle)\nand long-term (Skylab, MIR and ISS) human missions\n[7.6.15], [7.6.16]. There is fluid displacement toward\nthe head [7.6.17], [7.6.18], [7.6.19], which leads to a\nloss of liquid in the lower extremities of about 2 | and\nreduces the astronauts\u2019 plasma volume by up to 20%\n[7.6.15], [7.6.20], [7.6.21]. The production of red\nblood cells also decreases significantly during the first\nweeks in space, since erythropoietin production and\nrelease from the kidneys is reduced [7.6.22], [7.6.23].\nThe reduced plasma volume and lower red blood\ncell mass \u2014 the latter is critical for oxygen transport\ncapacity \u2014 reduce the maximal exercise astronauts can\nundertake, especially after landing back on Earth. In\naddition, reduced plasma volume as well as an altered\nsympathetic nerve receptor density and threshold in\nthe blood vessels and the heart can play a key role in\northostatic hypersensitivity. Also, the shift of volume\nalong the body axis from the body\u2019s lower to upper\nhalf leads to noticeable changes in heat emission\nvia the skin and probably affects the entire human\nheat balance under weightlessness. This is supported\nby recent data from relevant human physiology\nexperiments in connection with parabolic flights\n(Figure 7.6.3).\n\nUnder terrestrial conditions the head and neck are\nresponsible for over 30% of the heat exchange between\nthe body and the environment. Forced convection to\nventilate the space vehicle or the ISS could cause heat\nemission from this part of the body to be much higher.\nThis has been empirically confirmed by the experience\nof numerous astronauts who reported cool to cold\nextremities, to the extent that some of them wore\nsocks on their feet although the room temperature\nwas relatively high (ISS, approx. 29 \u00b0C).\n\n7\n\n2/24/09 2:41:39 PM\n",

The rapid dynamics of skin temperature changes which are caused by a fluid shift along the\nbody axis and during weightlessness lead to a striking increase in heat emission (Source: DLR).\n\n7.6.5.3 Muscles and Skeletal System\n\nBoth the muscles and skeleton require enough stimu-\nlus in the form of mechanical loading (\u201cstrain\u201d) to\nbe able to maintain their structure. Under weightless\nconditions this strain is reduced to a minimum.\nMuscle atrophy is noticeable after only a brief time\nin space, accompanied by structural and functional\nchanges in the muscles as well as a negative nitrogen\nbalance. This atrophy is especially pronounced in\nthe posture muscles which support the body against\ngravity. Without corrective measures astronauts\nlose up to 20% of their muscle mass during a short\nmission and up to 50% during long-term missions\n[7.6.3]. This loss is higher in the group of extensor\nmuscles compared to the flexors. The leg muscles have\nthe highest loss since the astronauts move through\ntheir new environment mainly by using their arms.\nTogether with the changes in the neurovestibular and\ncardiovascular systems, like dizziness and orthostasis,\nthe loss of strength and stamina lead to a considerable\n\nreduction in performance for astronauts returning\nto an environment with gravity \u2014 which in the case\nof a landing on Mars could hinder the success of the\nmission.\n\nChanges in muscles are closely linked to changes in\nthe skeletal system. Without adequate strain there is an\nimbalance between bone development and breakdown\nwith a global loss of bone mass of 1 to 3% per month\non average. In areas experiencing especially low strain\nthe bone density is reduced by up to 10% [7.6.3]. Loss\nof bone mass causes hypercalciuria. Although other\nfactors besides increased calcium levels in the urine\nare relevant (pH value, uric acid, oxalate), there is an\nincreased risk of post renal stone formation [7.6.3],\n[7.6.15]. Bone decomposition and the associated\nincreased risk of fractures, particularly of the lower\nextremities, and possible renal stone formation seri-\nously threaten the health of astronauts and the success\nof a mission. Appropriate countermeasures must be\ntaken.\n\n2/24/09 2:41:39 PM\n",
    "634": "7.6 Space Medicine and Biology\n\n7.6.5.4 Sensory Systems\n\nThe integration of visual, vestibular and kinesthetic\nstimuli makes orientation through the environment\npossible. The individual systems are interconnected.\nThus proprioceptive and visual information lead to\nthe vestibular system and from there back again to\ninvoluntary control of eye movement. The lack of\ngravitational stimulation leads to an incongruence of\ninformation of the semicircular canal of the inner ear,\nwhich independent of gravity only reacts to a change\nof position and the acceleration information from\nthe saccule and utricle. The discrepancy between this\ninformation and the kinesthetic and visual signals\ncan lead to so-called space motion sickness, which is\nexpressed in various types of dizziness, feeling ill or\nnausea [7.6.15], [7.6.24]. After a period of adjustment\nof a few days, these symptoms disappear, but can return\nafter the astronaut is back in a 1g environment.\n\nSome astronauts reported problems with nearsigh-\ntedness, which may be caused by fluid displacement\ntoward the head and changes in the shape of the eyeball\nand lens in a 0g environment [7.6.3].\n\nBecause of the various permanent sources of\nnoise on a space vehicle (motors, experiments, air-\nconditioning equipment) noise pollution reaches\nlevels of 60 to 100 dB [7.6.3], which besides causing\nstress also carries the risk of partial deafness and\nmakes appropriate acoustic and auditory protection\nnecessary.\n\n7.6.5.5 Diet\n\nNumerous factors must be considered regarding diet\nand nutrition. The food must be nonperishable (for\nmonths to years), the drinks powdered, the meals\nfreeze-dried. Water is added and mixed into the food\nonly on-board. Many meals are heated to high tem-\nperatures to make them long-lasting. All efforts must\nbe made to avoid food poisoning, which could be life\nthreatening for the entire crew on an interplanetary\nflight. In recent years it has been shown particularly\nduring long-term residence on MIR and the ISS that\nastronauts love \u201cspecial event meals\u201d to counteract the\nmonotony caused by external circumstances [7.6.3].\nTherefore, attention must be paid to taste and even\nto the type of packaging. Of course, nutritional value\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:613\n\n613\n\nand trace element content must be precisely known\nand adequate. Food that is too salty is to be avoided\nsince it fosters an increased removal of calcium from\nthe bones, which is accelerated anyway because of\nweightlessness.\n\nNASA has a collection of about 150 menus, to\nwhich another 150 menus from the Russians can be\nadded on the ISS, so the astronauts have about 300\ndifferent menu variations available. Alcohol is not per-\nmitted. The day\u2019s menu is divided into four segments:\nbreakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack. However, the\nconsumption of cookies is problematic since crumbs\nare not easy to remove under weightlessness and can\nhave unpleasant consequences like crumbs in the eyes,\nin other body openings, interference with technical\nand scientific equipment. Carbonated drinks must\nalso be avoided since they lead to unpleasant flatulence\nor eructation (the Latin word for belching). The latter\ncan also sometimes lead to spontaneous vomiting\nunder weightlessness.\n\nAstronauts and cosmonauts have a marked pre-\nference for strongly spiced food. In part, the reason\ncould be the liquid displacement along the body axis\ncaused by weightlessness, which causes the oral mucosa\nin the mouth and the tongue to swell (edema). Also,\nthe distribution of food in the mouth changes because\nof weightlessness, which leads to an altered sense of\nsmell. All these factors taken together are probably\nsufficient to show that nutrition under conditions\nof weightlessness \u2014 particularly for long flights \u2014 is\na problem which should not be underestimated. It\nhas already been well confirmed in isolation studies\nthat a balanced, varied diet is a decisive factor for the\noverall psycho-physiological well-being of astronauts,\nwhereby communal meals involving the entire crew\nalso play an important role in the daily schedule (the\nsocial components of meals), independent of energy\nsupply and taste [7.6.3], [7.6.15], [7.6.25].\n\nAs far as energy requirements are concerned, it\nwas surprising to discover that the caloric demand\nunder weightlessness hardly differs from that in 1g\nconditions for the astronauts. This could be because\nthere are increased energy requirements under\nweightlessness due to the daily muscle exercises\ninstituted as a countermeasure to muscle and bone\nloss in space, as well as due to the forced convection\nby the air-conditioning system inside the spacecraft\n\n2/24/09 2:41:41 PM\n",
    "635": "614\n\nbecause natural thermal convection is impossible\nunder microgravity conditions. Changes in digestion\n(resorption) and taste could also play a role [7.6.26],\n[7.6.27].\n\n7.6.5.6 Radiation\n\nClinical effects of exposure to radiation can be divided\ninto short- and long-term effects. The basis for both\nis the formation of highly reactive free radicals by the\nradiation, which can damage cell components, parti-\ncularly DNA and other control molecules. The short-\nterm effects, also known as radiation sickness, involve\nsymptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, reduced\nblood count, hemorrhaging and death, depending on\nthe strength of the dosage. Long-term effects affect\nthe DNA; radiation damage can lead to uncontrolled\ncell growth and finally to cancer if compensatory\nmechanisms like apoptosis (programmed cell death)\nor DNA repair (p-53 mechanism with premitotic\npause and restoration) are ineffective [7.6.3].\n\nThe radiation risk to astronauts is significant.\nFor missions near the Earth (LEO) crew members\nare well protected from ionizing radiation by the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field. But further out, the crew is\nexposed to far higher radiation levels. In the Van Allen\n\nEarth's atmosphere\n\nSea 1500m 3000m 12000m Low Earth\nlevel orbit\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nbelt, which extends up to an altitude of 30 000 km,\nradiation composed of high-energy protons and\nelectrons (approx. 1 keV to several megaelectronvolts\nfor electrons and hundreds of megaelectronvolts for\nprotons) prevails. Cosmic radiation (also known as\ncosmic background radiation) consists of high-energy\nionized nuclei, from hydrogen to uranium nuclei\n(up to 1000 MeV), whose origin is outside our Solar\nSystem. Solar particles are another important source\nof radiation risk, primarily consisting of high-energy\nprotons which are ejected into space during a solar\neruption (solar particle event (SPE)). This radiati-\non can significantly increase the energy of cosmic\nparticles, up to several hundred megaelectronvolts\nper nucleus. Neither the temporal occurrence and\nduration nor strength of such an eruption has been\nreliably predicted so far, whereby the radiation from\nSPE represents a serious danger for interplanetary\nlong-term missions [7.6.1], [7.6.3].\n\nRadiation dosage D is measured in grays (Gy),\nwhere 1 Gy is equivalent to an absorbed energy of\n1 J/kg. Since the various radiation sources also differ\nin the strength of the biological effects, the so-called\nequivalent dosage D, in sieverts (Sv) is used. Depen-\nding on the radiation source, the radiation dosage D\nis multiplied by a factor for its significance in each\n\n300-700\n\nVan Allen Lunar base Interplanetary Interstellar\nradiation belt space space\n\nDistance from the Earth's surface (not according to scale) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u00bb\n\nFigure 7.6.4: Radiation exposition for different mission scenarios: LEO, interplanetary transit, Moon, Mars (Source: Kent Snodgrass).\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:614 & 2/24/09 2:41:42 PM\n",

It can be seen that radiation exposure in\nscenarios 2 to 4 is substantial and that measures to\nprotect the space vehicle, lunar or Martian habitat\nmust be taken [7.6.28], [7.6.29].\n\n7.6.6 Psycho-Physiological Problems\nArising from Residence in Space\n\n7.6.6.1 Biorhythms\n\nIn space, humans are almost completely isolated from\nthe physical and social environmental factors which\nnormally determine their biorhythms. The terrestrial\nalternation between day and night is mimicked by con-\ntrolling the artificial illumination in the space vehicle,\nand the daily fluctuations in ambient temperature are\nalso artificially maintained, to mention only some of the\nrelevant factors. Social factors, whose origins are family,\nworkplace and friendships, are lacking. Endogenous\nbiorhythms must adjust to a large extent to the mission\u2019s\npredetermined work and relaxation rhythms. The\nduration and quality of sleep have to be so optimized\nthat performance readiness and a subjective feeling of\nwell-being are maintained. However, the need to more\nor less stringently organize the daily routine means that\nindividual needs have to be adapted to the needs of the\nentire group, and this for the duration of the entire mis-\nsion. Negative consequences are inevitable because over\nlong periods of time the astronaut\u2019s psychological state\nand work capacity fluctuate considerably. In this respect\nobservations made during terrestrial isolation studies\ndo not differ significantly from Russian experiences on\nlong missions [7.6.4]. The daily schedule during the\nRussian isolation experiences is as follows: work period\n09:00 to 17:00, resting 17:00-23:00, sleeping 23:00 to\n07:00, getting-up phase 07:00-09:00, with meals four\ntimes a day. Presumably, there is accordingly little oppo-\nrtunity for an individual style which significantly varies\nfrom this routine.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:615\n\n615\n\nMeasurements of activity patterns with the help\nof accelerometers during a four-week ESA isolation\nstudy produced fairly similar results on workdays for\nall six test subjects [7.6.6]. Measurements on weekends\nshowed, as expected, more individualized behavior\npatterns. Especially the distribution of sleep periods\ndiffered from the normal weekday pattern. However,\nstrict regulation of the daily schedule should mean\nrespecting natural sleep requirements, which during\nthe day are especially pronounced after the main meal.\nIt is known that forced, artificially extended periods\nof wakefulness negatively influence cognitive abilities,\nsomething which should definitely be avoided on long\nmissions. But there is no general strategy which can\nbe applied to the situation in space. The conditions\nunder isolation and the length of the particular mis-\nsion influence the sleep-wake rhythm as well as the\ncognition of the astronauts. Russian experience has\nshown that after an initial 14-day adjustment period a\nmission phase follows in which there is full adaptation\nuntil about the 90th day. Afterward, sleep problems\ncan be expected, the activity of the crew members is\nreduced, and a reduction in the range of their interests\ncan be observed. Increased nervousness and tiredness\nbecome evident. Since these phenomena were found\nduring terrestrial isolation studies as well as in space,\nitis hard to identify the role played by weightlessness.\nIt is currently unknown how weightlessness affects\nbiorhythmic processes at the cellular and molecular\nlevels, and what the consequences are for the entire\nsystem. In the future this will be a field for appropriate\nexperiments [7.6.30].\n\n7.6.6.2 Isolation and Constricted Movement\n\nIn the course of dealing with the physiological con-\nsequences of long periods in space, medical doctors\nhad to consider the problems of isolation, solitude,\nloneliness and confinement of movement [7.6.31].\nConfinement is often connected with a lack of exer-\ncise, which plays a role in the discussion of corrective\nmeasures (see Section 7.6.7 below) as well as in this sec-\ntion. But isolation and confinement are not problems\nlimited to space flight only; they can be observed every\nday in society. In the large cities of Western Europe\nalmost 50% of the population lives in single-person\nhouseholds, either by choice (singles, primarily young\n\n2/24/09 2:41:44 PM\n",

Gravity 40% proprioreceptors (skin, muscles, joints)\n2. Light 30% eyes\n\n3. Sound 10% ears\n\n4. Smell, taste 10% nose, mouth\n\n5. Temperature 10% skin, CNS (Central Nervous System)\n\npeople) or because of external circumstances like the\ndeath of a partner. This trend is reinforced by increasing\nlongevity. In order to identify the physiological effects\nof this change in ambient conditions, new, noninvasive\ntechnologies must be developed for continuous data\ncollection. They should have low energy requirements,\nnot get in the way when they are worn, and be easy to\nuse by a layperson. This continuous flow of signals\nproduces large amounts of data which can only be\nmanaged with the help of modern information tech-\nnology. Time-series analyses are particularly valuable.\nWhen recording and processing data, the spectrum of\nstimuli, which is normal on Earth, should be kept in\nmind (Table 7.6.2).\n\nFor example, if gravity is lacking in space, then\n40% of the body\u2019s stimuli disappears. In the case of the\nother parameters, noise, smell and taste, no large vari-\nations due to physical confinement are expected.\n\nLiving together in close quarters always means con-\nsideration for others; not what everybody wants, but\nwhat is the least disruptive has to be determined. This\nleads to an overall leveling down and to monotony. Iso-\nlation and confinement therefore mean a reduction or\ndeficit in stimuli. In the best case this can lead to relax-\nation followed by recovery, particularly if one has been\nliving in an overstimulated environment. If the removal\nof stimuli is unavoidable, such as for long residence in\nspace, the first step is light deconditioning leading to\na vicious circle as described in Figure 7.6.5.\n\nIn LEO this can be combated by the indicated\ncountermeasures which provide psychological and\nsocial support (telephone calls to family members)\n[7.6.31]. Physical refreshment can for example be\nproduced by thermal stimulation in an otherwise\nthermally monotonous environment. Such stimulus\nsubstitution measures are absolutely necessary in a\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nIsolation and confinement (IC)\n\nIC \u2014\u00ae Stimulus deprivation \u2014\u00bb relaxion \u2014\u00ae recovery\n\nSlight\ndeconditioning\n\nTotal >\ndeconditioning\n\nStimulus\ndeprivation\u00b0\u00ae | Ic\nIc Ext\u00e9nsive\nstimulus 9@\nwithdrawal\n\na KK _peconei\n\ntioning * IC Countermeasures:\nOStimutus substitution\nIc % Bodywork\n\u00ae Psychological and\n\nIc \u2018social support\n\nFigure 7.6.5: Stimulus deprivation, stimulus withdrawal and the\nvicious circle which has to be overcome with appropriate corrective\nmeasures during long space flights (Source: [7.6.14]).\n\nmonotonous environment in order to break out from\nthe vicious circle which ends in total deconditioning.\nThis situation can lead to not being able to readjust\nto terrestrial conditions. Stimulus substitution not\nonly helps to make the stress associated with residence\nin space bearable, but also improves the chances for\nsmooth readaptation to terrestrial conditions. Con-\nsidering the experience gathered under space condi-\ntions, rehabilitation measures on Earth, such as after\nlong immobility and sickness, need reevaluation.\n\nThe effects of a reduced social spectrum should\nnot be underestimated. A crew consists of four to eight\nmembers at most, and they have to get along. The com-\nmunication within such a group can vary considerably\nduring a mission, as suggested in Figure 7.6.6.\n\nThe number of verbal communications among\ngroup members during the joint meal in a 28-day\nperiod of isolation was recorded. On the second day\nit can be noted that the communication of person D\nwith commander C dominates; the other members are\nalmost excluded. But by the end of the mission (26th\nday), person D is totally isolated during the meal. This\nsocial isolation within the group can have somatic\neffects which must be avoided [7.6.32]. One reason\nfor isolation might be modern computer games,\nwhich each person can play alone in some corner of\nthe space vehicle resulting in sitting back to back at\nleisure time without communicating. Competitive\ngroup games can counteract such a development.\nCrew selection is important here, so that the team\n\n2/24/09 2:41:45 PM\n",
    "638": "7.6 Space Medicine and Biology\n\nFigure 7.6.6: Communication networks on days 2, 14 and 26 during\nteam isolation (Source: modified from [7.6.32]).\n\nhas the right composition. Only then can it fulfill its\ntask in the long term.\n\nIt can be said in summary that a multitude of\nparameters affect the group cohesion and perfor-\nmance of a team: cultural background, the leadership\nqualities of the commander, sex, age, emotional\nstability, expertise and cooperativeness, to name\nbut a few [7.6.3], [7.6.15]. All these factors must be\nconsidered when a crew is selected for a long stay in\nspace. Physiological performance factors also play a\nrole, but not necessarily a dominant one, once the\nbasic parameters have been achieved (well trained\nat least to an average level). Psychologists have an\nimportant role in deciding what is the right data to\nconsider.\n\n7.6.7 Corrective Measures\n\nIt should first be pointed out that the physiologi-\ncal changes noted so far under weightlessness are\nadaptations which are appropriate for the space\nenvironment. The Russian cosmonaut Poljakov\nlived in the Russian MIR station for periods up to\n14 months. Medical physiological problems usually\noccur when the astronauts are again subjected to a\nhigher level of gravity, whether on Earth or in the\nfuture on the Moon or Mars. But here, particularly\nin the case of extravehicular activities in the context\nof a mission, physical fitness is the conditio sine qua\nnon. Appropriate corrective measures must be taken,\nespecially those assuring that the proper functioning\nof the cardiovascular, thermoregulatory skeletal and\nmuscle systems is maintained. Providing emergency\nmedical care for missions to the Moon or Mars could,\njust to consider the operational reasons alone, always\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:617\n\n617\n\nonly be possible to a limited extent. For presence in\nLEO it is another matter, since in a medical emergency\nan astronaut or cosmonaut can be evacuated relatively\nquickly to Earth (rescue capsule, emergency descent),\nsomething which is not possible for lunar and certain-\nly not for Mars missions.\n\nAmong the corrective measures in the narrower\nsense can be counted all those treatments and thera-\npeutic measures which serve to guarantee or restore\nthe physical, mental and spiritual well-being and\nhealth of astronauts before, during and after a space\nflight. Physical, biochemical, chemical, pharmaceuti-\ncal, biological, and psychological measures are pos-\nsible. Table 7.6.3 provides an overview of various\npossibilities.\n\nIn the preparatory phase of a space flight they\ninclude crew selection (\u201cselect in\u201d) in order to assure\na crew who are as efficient as possible and in which\nthere is the lowest risk of interpersonal conflict.\nPhysical and mental training programs have to be\nmade available, and care must be taken to achieve\nthe required physical fitness and high, continuous\nmental performance levels and alertness, not to\nmention programs which prepare the organism for\naltered circadian rhythms. During the flight most\nof the corrective measures concern providing and\ncarrying out an exercise program of several hours\nwith the help of customized training methods like\ntreadmills, flywheels, rowing equipment, a \u201cpenguin\nsuit,\u201d a vibration platform, etc. After return from\nspace intensive psycho-physiological training pro-\ngrams are necessary to accustom the astronauts to\nthe terrestrial environment and to their social milieu\n(\u201cpostflight disorders\u201d). It has been shown that this\npostflight phase to reestablish the original preflight\nsituation requires almost as much time as the space\nflight itself (Figure 7.6.7).\n\nAn exception in the physiological realm has to do\nwith the changes which occur in bone metabolism,\nwhich according to the present state of scientific\nknowledge cannot be completely returned to the\ninitial values.\n\n7.6.7.1 Cardiovascular System\n\nIn order to avoid orthostatic hypersensitivity and\nphysical deconditioning on the part of the astronauts\n\n2/24/09 2:41:45 PM\n",

This variety is\nnecessary not only for physiological reasons, but also\n\nCHO7.indd Sect:618 \u00a9\n\nfrom a psychological point of view, particularly to\navoid boredom. During the training units it should\nbe assured that basic cardiovascular and pulmonary\ndata can be noninvasively monitored, stored and\nanalyzed (V, heart frequency, blood pressure,\n\n>\nmax\u2019?\n\n2/24/09 2:41:46 PM\n",

Before landing, there should\nbe a possibility for the astronauts to be supplied with\nliquid in order to increase their plasma volume. This\nkind of liquid replenishment can still be carried out\nafter orthostatic intolerance has developed. For this\ntreatment practical devices for intravenous infusions\nand increasing plasma volume must be at hand for\nemergencies and the astronauts have to be trained in\nthe technique of intravenous infusion. During the criti-\ncal phase of reentry, antigravity suits are worn, which\nsupport blood flow toward the upper body by applying\npressure to the legs; in addition, horizontally oriented\nseats are used [7.6.15]. Despite these countermeasures\northostatic intolerance remains for the most part an\nunsolved clinical and mission-relevant problem.\n\n7.6.7.2 Muscle and Skeletal System\n\nPower training to maintain body strength and bone\nmass is the second pillar of physical exercise, the\nimmediate motivation being here, too, to preserve\nthe strength of the hands for work outside the space\nvehicle [7.6.3], [7.6.15], [7.6.24], [7.6.35]. In addition\nto various elastic band and stretching systems for\nresistance training, the procedures mentioned above\nfor cardiovascular training can also be used, such as\nrowing machines or a treadmill, in which the trainee\nis pulled toward the machine via a system of elastic\nresistance bands (high-impact training to maintain\nbone structure). It has been shown that already a\nslight amount of vibration exerts sufficient stimuli\nto maintain bone mass. The application of vibrations\nduring the flight could help shorten the current tedi-\nous exercise regime. Pharmacological approaches to\nmaintain muscle tone and the skeletal system include\ndoses of amino acids to stimulate protein synthesis\nand of biphosphonates to reduce global calcium loss\nand maintain bone density.\n\n7.6.7.3 Neurosensory System\n\nThe lack of gravitational stimulation in space leads\nto incompatible information coming from the visual,\nvestibular and kinesthetic system, which can lead to\nwhat is known as space motion sickness [7.6.15],\n[7.6.24]. Although symptoms like dizziness, nausea\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:619\n\n619\n\nand feeling ill recede after a few days, they often\nreturn upon entry into a gravitational field, which\ncould hinder the continuation of the mission once the\nastronauts arrive on Mars. Unfortunately, there are\nlarge differences in the nature and particular expres-\nsion of symptoms, both between individuals and for\nthe same person on different occasions. These often\ndo not agree with observations made in experiments\non Earth, making it difficult to predict susceptibility\nto space motion sickness. Selecting individuals with\na high tolerance for movement, acceleration and\ndeceleration did not produce the desired results.\nThe use of biofeedback and autogenous training\nwas successful in reducing some of the symptoms.\nMedication (e.g., promethazine) can also reduce the\nseverity of space motion sickness, but it also can lead\nto a drop in performance (affecting reaction time and\npattern recognition, for example) and can negatively\ninfluence sleep and overall mood.\n\n7.6.7.4 Radiation Protection\n\nSelection of crew members based on the lowest pos-\nsible number of changes in particular gene loci known\nto be oncogenes, as well as the extraction and storage\nof bone marrow as a regeneration possibility, can be\ncarried out also before the flight as precautionary\nmeasures to avoid later malignant illness. Pharma-\ncological radiation protection is available in the\nform of free radical scavengers as well as innova-\ntive radioprotective substances (like DNA-binding\nWR-33278). Protease inhibitors and substances like\ndimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) can hinder the evolution\nof an already radiation-damaged cell into a cancerous\ncell cluster. This development gives rise to the hope\nthat pharmacological approaches can be developed\nto counter radiation risks.\n\nOn the technical side, the hull of the space vehicle\nitself supplies the most protection. Since most of the\nrisk comes from high-energy solar particles moving\nslower than the speed of light, a satellite-supported\nearly warning system could be put into operation.\nAs soon as a solar event (eruption, solar wind) has\nbeen identified, the information can be relayed to the\ncrew on-board the space vehicle, which would give\nthem enough time to get to an especially shielded area\n[7.6.28], [7.6.29].\n\n2/24/09 2:41:47 PM\n",
    "641": "CHO7.indd Sec1:620\n\n620\n\nAn innovative technical approach would be to use\na magnetic deflector to divert solar particles from the\nspace vehicle. New superconducting electromagnetic\ncoils which no longer require supercooling have shown\npromising results and are financially affordable. But\ndata is not yet available on the long-term effects of\ncomparable magnetic fields on human tissues.\n\n7.6.7.5 Personal Databases for Astronauts\n\nIt can been seen from all that has been said above that\nthere are great individual differences in the progression\nand extent of adjustments which astronauts make to\ntheir new environment (e.g., as to the neurovestibular\nsystem, liquids and electrolytes, cardiovascular system,\nred blood cells, bone and calcium metabolism, nonfat\nbody mass) [7.6.3], [7.6.15]. It is essential that these\nchanges be recorded and monitored for each indivi-\ndual astronaut as completely and as long as possible\nbefore (baseline data), during and after their presence\nin space. This data is, for example, essential for esta-\nblishing guidelines for exercise programs designed to\ncounteract cardiovascular deconditioning. Such data\nis also needed in case of emergencies.\n\n7.6.8 Outlook\n\nSpace medicine research is characterized by innovative\nscientific approaches and pioneering technological\napplications. Although an apparently very exotic\nspecialty, it has a frequently underestimated high\nclinical relevance. Specifically, practical questions of\nhigh-altitude, climate, diving, sport and occupational\nmedicine, and also rehabilitation and even isolation\nresearch, are subjects of interest (osteoporosis, car-\ndiovascular illness, corrective measures and exercise\nregimes, etc.). Space medicine research thus extends\nfar beyond the narrow realm of space physiology and\nspace medicine. Terrestrial simulation studies with\ntheir customized and sometimes unique simulation\nmodels and equipment (bed rest, lowered head posi-\ntions, isolation and immersion) are superbly suited\nfor addressing interdisciplinary human physiology\nconcerns in great scientific depth and breadth. At the\nsame time, such studies serve to introduce the next\ngeneration of scientists to this field of investigation\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nand to interest them in the subject, in order to ensure\nthat research continues. This problem should not\nbe underestimated in the typically extremely long\nplanning periods of space activities. For scientific,\ntechnological and economic reasons, research in space\nmedicine and space physiology must be regarded as\nan integral, essential component of space policy also\nin the future.\n\nBibliography\n\n7.6.1 Messerschmid, E., Bertrand, R.

Such missions usually involve challenging\nnew concepts, and mission preparation frequently has\nan additional positive spin-off effect on developments\nnot related to space activities.\n\n2/24/09 2:41:48 PM\n",

Thus the BIRD satel-\nlite is being used to test a variety of new approaches\nin the fields of infrared sensors, attitude regulation,\nautomatic navigation and on-board software. The first\nGalileo navigation satellites, GIOVE A and B, are also\nin this category.\n\nIt is not possible to present a complete overview of\nall technology missions, but some insights into typical\naspects of the technologies involved can be gained\nfrom a look at some selected examples. This section\nfeatures two applications, space robotics (Section\n7.7.1) and on-orbit servicing (Section 7.7.2). Both\nareas have such high relevance for future space mis-\nsions that they are worth closer inspection.\n\n7.7.1 Space Robotics\n\nTransporting persons into space, keeping them alive\nthere and bringing them safely back to Earth requires\na tremendous effort, which also finds expression in\nthe high cost of this endeavor. The explanation is that\nhumankind evolved in the course of some hundred\nthousand years to be optimally suited to conditions\non Earth. For the foreseeable future people will not be\nable to accustom themselves to the hostile conditions\nof space \u2014 the consequence being the enormous effort\nto create appropriate life support systems, including\nexpensive space suits.\n\nRobotic systems are another matter. The field itself\nis little more than 40 years old and can be adapted\nwithin a short time and at relatively low cost to the\nspace environment. When combined with powerful\nremote control and telepresence technology, the some-\ntimes overrated question of how long it will take for\nrobots to become really intelligent and able to work\nautonomously becomes fairly irrelevant. Once the\nbasic concepts behind \u201can extended arm in space\u201d\nhave been understood and realized, then one can\nswitch at will during a mission among all possible\ndegrees of shared autonomy between an operator\non the ground and a robot in space, incorporating\nat each point in time the momentary state of the art\nin achieving the highest possible level of autonomy\non-board a spacecraft. This kind of activity in space\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nwith remote control from Earth, coupled with the rapid\nadvances in robot technology, offer an increasingly\ncost-effective alternative to human space flight. But\nthis option is also becoming more attractive because\nso-called telepresence concepts are making it possible\nto give many people on the ground a realistic feeling\nof how it would be if they were \u201con location\u201d in space;\nup until now this feeling was the preserve of only a few\nastronauts and cosmonauts.\n\nThe questions naturally arise of what robots should\nachieve in space and which control technology is most\nsuited to the purpose.\n\nIn a space system, as in any technical system,\nproblems can arise which threaten the system its-\nelf, its environs, the astronauts on the ISS, or the\npopulation on Earth. Those problems will require\nrepairs accomplished with human intervention. In\nthe case of the ISS it is the astronauts themselves who\nmust attempt to solve any problems, possibly during\nextravehicular activities, which involve dexterity,\nintensive prior training and enormous physical effort.\nThe idea of sending astronauts to defective satellites\nin low Earth orbit (LEO) is even more difficult and\nexpensive \u2014 the last planned Hubble repair was long\nthreatened by the high cost and risks connected with\nthe Space Shuttle. So far, space systems located above\nabout 500 km cannot be reached by astronauts on the\nshuttle and are thus irreparable, when telecommands\nfrom ground and software modifications fail to solve\nthe problem.\n\nSatellites equipped with robotic arms, so-called\nrobonauts, are controlled from Earth and in the future\nshould be in a position to solve many problems. Re-\nmotely controlled robonauts will support astronauts\nin routine and maintenance activities on the space\nstation, retrieve and repair satellites which are tum-\nbling uncontrolled, and make space available in the\npopular geostationary orbit by removing redundant\nspacecraft.\n\nSo far there has been no possibility to service space\nsystems in the economically most efficient way by\nrobots; for example, to have remotely controlled robots\ncapture an object and cause it to fall into the Atlantic\nor Pacific Ocean, thereby avoiding problems with\ndebris (see also Section 7.7.2). In 2003 the European\nParliament challenged Europe to assume internatio-\nnal leadership in this area. The term exploration, by\n\n2/24/09 2:41:48 PM\n",

In this\nfield robotic systems are an even more cost-effective\nalternative to human space flight.\n\nEither autonomously or controlled from Earth,\nrovers equipped with robotic arms can collect and\nanalyze rock samples, or make preparations for human\nresidence on distant planets. How remote control\nfunctions depends on what communications links\nare available and on the signal travel times. A robot\non Mars would have to function as autonomously\nas possible. The operator on the ground can only\ndefine the goal, leaving it to the system in space to\nindependently determine via calculations how it is to\nbe accomplished. Here, direct remote control is not\npossible because of the long signal propagation delay\n(about 15 minutes). Such high signal propagation\ndelays mandate that the robotic system independently\nnavigates, recognizes objects, and knows how to grasp\nand manipulate them.\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of communication\nlinks with relatively short signal propagation delays\n(under 0.5 seconds), use can be made of the telepre-\nsence control technologies mentioned above. This\nvery powerful operating tool puts the operators at the\nground station in a position to use the information\nsupplied, such as stereo images, forces and moments,\nto react as if they were themselves in space.\n\nFortunately, it is possible for all robotic systems\norbiting the Earth to comply with the \u201chalf-second\ncontrol loop boundary limit\u2019, given adequate (al-\nthough not yet generally available) communications\ninfrastructure. This limit primarily goes into effect\nif haptic feedback is desired; in other words, sen-\nsing and selectively exerting forces in space. In the\nvisual channel, however, people are fairly well able\nto manage delay times up to 1 second. If the robotic\nsystem is in LEO and if one is not satisfied with the\nshort ground station pass durations of typically 7-10\nminutes (whereby the signal propagation delay is then\nabout 10 ms), then one requires a link to a geostati-\nonary satellite, from there to a robotic satellite in a\nlow orbit (e.g., 300 km) and from there via an auto-\nmatically tracking antenna back to the geostationary\nsatellite and to the ground station. The control loop\ntime is then in the realm of the required half second\nand contact times of 40 minutes are not untypical in\nsuch cases.\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:623\n\n623\n\nTelepresence \u2014\nan extended arm in\nspace for humankind\n\n250 ms\n\nFigure 7.7.1: CX-OLEV: the minimal \u201cround-trip signal propagation\ntime\u201d to robots in LEO is 0.5 s, and to robots in GEO 0.25 s.\n\nSatellite repair and maintenance in geostationary\norbit are even easier to accomplish with such a pow-\nerful telepresence operating mode because the signal\npropagation delay amounts to only about 0.25 seconds\nand the link is continuous (Figure 7.7.1).\n\n7.7.1.1 Manipulators in Earth Orbit\n\nThe artificial arms which have been employed opera-\ntionally in space are usually called manipulators and\nresemble cranes that are remotely controlled by the\nastronauts over a distance of a few meters (hence the\nesignation telemanipulators). The first spectacular\nand successful manipulator in space was the Shuttle\nRemote Manipulator System (SRMS), a Canadian\nevelopment which flew in space for the first time\nin 1981 in the cargo bay of the shuttle. This approx.\n15 m long arm still often accompanies the shuttle;\nit has been used over 100 times so far, frequently to\neploy and retrieve satellites and systems in need of\nrepair (as in the case of the Hubble Space Telescope),\nut also to move astronauts around in free space\nFigure 7.7.2).\n\nIts six-jointed arm is practically without any sensor-\nsupported autonomy and is controlled exclusively by\nthe astronauts using two joysticks, one for translation\nand one for rotation of the end effector. This control-\nling requires extensive training because the long arm\n\nlon\n\nswings back and forth when it is moved, whereby the\ncausative elasticities are primarily concentrated in the\n\n2/24/09 2:41:49 PM\n",

After the Columbia shuttle accident the arm was\nequipped with instruments which make it possible to\ninspect the shuttle for external damage. The successor\nof this arm is the so-called Canadarm II on the ISS,\nalso known as the Space Station Remote Manipulator\nSystem (SSRMS).\n\nAn approx. 17 m long main arm is supplemented\nby two smaller arms of 3 m in length (Special Purpose\nDexterous Manipulator (SPDM)), see Figure 7.7.3.\nThe main arm can be transported on a platform that\nmoves along rails extending the length of the space\n\nstation.

The\ndocking of a servicing robot followed by the cutting\nof the solar panel clamp mechanism with metal shears\nwould have made the satellite functional. Although\nshears to cut through the titanium clamps which kept\nthe solar panels from unfolding had already been deve-\nloped, a repair mission did not materialize. At the end\nof 2006 practically the same problem occurred with the\ninitially highly celebrated Chinese telecommunications\nsatellite Xinnuo 2. Its panels did not fully deploy either;\nthe satellite had to be abandoned. Once again, the\naforementioned shears would have sufficed to carry\n\n627\n\nout the repair \u2014 another example of the importance\nof orbital robotic servicing from Earth.\n\nAs indicated, for such a capture it is crucial that\nthe reaction effects which a moving arm exerts on its\nplatform are kept under control, either by calculating\nthem in advance or by compensating for them with\nreaction wheels (for the rotation) or cold gas jets\n(for the translation). A number of experts in robot\ndynamics are still working today on the dynamic\neffects of free-flying robots, including so-called\nnull space motion in cases of kinematic redundancy\n(seven or more displacement degrees of freedom).\nFigure 7.7.10 shows that a seven-jointed robot which\nalways traces exactly the same circular motion in\nspace nevertheless displaces its platform differently\ndepending on how its individual joints move (which\nin the case of the mentioned redundancy cannot be\nunambiguously determined).\n\nAn opportunity to investigate dynamic interac-\ntions in space was soon offered. Japan\u2019s space agency\nNASDA (now JAXA) launched the first free-flying\nspace robot in 1997 as part of the ETS-VII mission\n(Figure 7.7.11). \u201cStanding\u201d on a platform it func-\ntioned without problems for over two years.

When combined with innovative\ntorque sensors in each joint, what are probably the\nmost advanced robot arms to date were developed.\nBecause of their sensitive \u201csoft robotics\u201d qualities and\nkinematic redundancy (seven joints) they are espe-\ncially well suited for direct interaction with humans\nand can accordingly be regarded as the foundation for\nfuture \u201crobonauts\u201d (Figure 7.7.13).

Because a robot grasping element\nhas six degrees of freedom of movement in space,\nthe trackball developed for ROTEX (now called\nthe space ball or space mouse) is very suitable for\nintuitive human-robot interactions in six degrees\nof freedom in space. Normally velocity control is\nrealized; the small displacements of the control cap\nare proportionately converted to velocity commands,\nbut force and momentum instructions are also pos-\nsible using the same concept since the stiffness of the\ncontrol hardware is known. Joystick displacements\nare also usually interpreted as velocity commands,\nbut only two degrees of freedom are completely\n\n2/24/09 2:42:54 PM\n",

If such a joystick\nis equipped with two small actuators, then the user\ncan supply a distant slave robot with a force, as in the\ncase of ROKVISS (Figure 7.7.17). But if one wants\nto control six degrees of freedom with feedback,\nthen a force-reflecting hand controller with at least\nsix actuated joints, actually a small torque controlled\nrobot (master), is necessary. Master and slave can\nhave completely different kinematics. The first space-\nrelevant concepts in this direction were developed at\nJPL in Pasadena, California, in the 1980s, but have so\nfar not been employed (Figure 7.7.19).\n\nIf one wants to remotely control robot arms with\nartificial hands in an especially intuitive and efficient\nway, then so-called exoskeleton techniques using data\n\nROKVISS\n\nFigure 7.7.18: Telepresence control (upper left) and the camera\nimages (stereo) of the ROKVISS arm (Source: DLR).\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\ngloves are a possibility which is also being investigated\nby ESA, for example. In this case the entire human\narm is involved in the control and force feedback\n(Figure 7.7.20). This makes it possible intuitively to\nremotely control free-flying robonauts (Figure 7.7.21);\nthe technique will presumably be employed for future\norbital servicing (see also Section 7.7.2).\n\nNASA is also developing two-armed humanoid\ntorsos as a basis for future robonauts (Figure 7.7.22).\n\n7.7.1.4 Lander Missions for Exploring Space\n\nThe successes experienced with unmanned missions\nto the planets and other celestial bodies during the\nlast 25 years have been remarkable and have become\nabsolute highlights of space flight.

The establishment and\noperation of permanent stations there will assuredly\nnot happen without robotic support.\n\n7.7.2 On-Orbit Servicing\n\nOn-orbit servicing (OOS), the provision of services in\nspace, is a key element in the continued exploitation\nof the space and in establishing and maintaining the\nrequired space infrastructure. It can considerably re-\nduce the operating costs for contemporary unmanned\nspace assets such as navigation satellites and geostatio-\nnary communications satellites. This aspect is already\nan important consideration in human space flight and\nis usually carried out by the astronauts themselves\n\u2014 sometimes supported by hand-controlled robotic\nelements. For unmanned space activities it means the\nuse of robots with a high degree of autonomy. This\naspect of unmanned space flight, which is becoming\nincreasingly important and necessary, is discussed in\nthis section.\n\nThe servicing of satellites in orbit includes all\naspects of component assembly and equipment main-\ntenance (both preventive and corrective), the replenish-\nment of consumables, and upgrade and repair. The life\ncycle of a space mission can be subdivided into three\nsegments, each with its own typical sources of failure:\n1. Ifthe payload cannot be injected into the specified\n\ntarget or transfer orbit because of failure in one of\nthe launcher stages, then orbit correction may be\nrequired. In most cases the satellite cannot accom-\nplish this on its own, therefore an orbit transfer\nvehicle could provide support.\n\n2. The \u201cmission start\u201d phase includes at least the in-\norbit checkout, but can also extend 6 to 12 months\ninto the operational phase. A failure message dur-\ning so-called begin of life (BOL) can imply the\nnecessity for repair, such as the subsequent release\nof a jammed deployment mechanism for a solar\ngenerator or an antenna dish.\n\n3. The \u201cmission conclusion\u201d phase can \u2014 but must\nnot \u2014 be identical to the end of planned service\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:637\n\n637\n\nlife. A satellite can reach its so-called end of life\n(EOL) prematurely because of wear or equipment\nobsolescence.\n\nA typical servicing profile is usually associated with\nBOL failures, which may affect the entire mission. In\nthe case of EOL failures (aging), the main interest is\nin increasing the lifetime beyond EOL; for example, in\norder to maintain the services provided by the satellite.\nScheduled servicing operations require a servicing\nstrategy between BOL and EOL, such as module or\ncomponent upgrade, replacement or retrofit or the\nrefurbishment of functional surfaces like reflectors,\nsolar generators, radiators, etc. With the help of the\nSpace Shuttle, astronauts carried out the only major\nservicing program to date for an unmanned satellite\nat considerable cost: the repair and servicing missions\nfor the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n7.7.2.1 Characteristics and Options\n\nServicing and repair by robotic elements in space\n\ninvolves certain basic task requirements: access to the\n\norbit of the target object, orbital maneuvering, and\nproximity servicing operations.\n\nServicing is chiefly carried out by the replace-\nment of modular components for purposes of repair,\nmaintenance or upgrading. The accommodation of\nall replaceable components in a single replaceable\nmodule minimizes both the complexity and cost of\nservicing. Modularizing has another advantage: the\ncomplexity is directly proportional to the number of\nactive interfaces between system components. One\ncan group typical service missions into three main\ncategories, which can be further broken down into\nsubcategories, and then derive the requisite robotic\ncapabilities for each field of operation:\n\n1. Inspection: Recording and collecting data from\nthe target satellite. This task requires merely the\ncapability to fly around the satellite plus the cor-\nresponding visual sensor technology:\n\n(a) Remote Inspection: Failure diagnosis by\n\nremote sensing of target.\n\n(b) Close-up Inspection: Scanning the target\n\nsatellite using various kinds of sensor tech-\nnology.\n\n2. Motion: Translation services to the target satellite,\nwhich requires docking capability. These tasks\n\n2/24/09 2:43:27 PM\n",
    "659": "CHO7.indd Sec1:638\n\n638\n\nrelate to the assumption of orbit and attitude\n\ncontrol, or orbit and station change. The service\n\nsatellite must accordingly have an appropriate\npropulsion and attitude regulating capability:\n\n(a) Reorbit: This task includes the transfer of\na stranded target satellite to its originally\nplanned operational orbit, or a later change of\noperational orbit in case the former position is\nto be occupied by a new or superior satellite.\n\n(b) Deorbit: This task includes the transfer of\nthe target satellite into a so-called graveyard\norbit, or into a reentry orbit for its deliberate\ndestruction and thus disposal in the atmos-\nphere.\n\n(c) Salvage: This task involves either the transfer\nof the target satellite to another space vehicle,\nor its nondestructive reentry.\n\n3. Manipulation: This involves dedicated control of\nsubsystems or some type of intervention, which\nrequires additional interfaces between the target\nand service satellites:\n\n(a) Maintenance and Checkout: Supplying the\ntarget satellite with consumables (liquids,\nfuel) as well as cleaning, resurfacing and\ndecontamination tasks.\n\n(b) Repair: Diagnosis and correction of module\nfailure in the solar generators, gyroscopes,\nantennas, etc.\n\n(c) Retrofit: Upgrading by replacement with\nmore efficient modules.\n\n(d) Docked Inspection: Failure diagnosis by\nphysical interrogation of the target satellite\nvia connectors.\n\nAll these tasks can be necessary throughout the entire\nlifetime of the satellite (see Table 7.7.1). Exceptions\nare maintenance and retrofit in the BOL phase, and\nreorbiting and repair in the EOL phase.\n\n7.7.2.2 On-Orbit Services\n\nThere is a natural hierarchy of tasks which can be\ncarried out by on-orbit servicers in order of increasing\ncomplexity. Inspection involves investigating space\nassets for damage assessment and failure reporting of\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nTable 7.7.1: Overview of servicing tasks.\n\nType of service Demand\n\nEmergency Scheduled\n\nRemote inspection e e\nDocked inspection e e\nReorbiting e\n\nDeorbiting e e\nSalvage e\n\nMaintenance\n\nRepair e\n\nRetrofit e\n\nthe externally visible state of the target. This requires\nthe technology of highly precise maneuvering. For\ngreater distances in the kilometer range, absolute\nnavigation may be necessary, but in all other cases\nthe preference, for safety reasons, is precise maneu-\nvering with relative navigation to the target, whereby\nthe attitude and orientation of the service satellite\nhave to be determined with appropriate sensory\ninstruments.\n\nIn order to carry out the next phases in on-orbit\nservicing, a rendezvous and docking maneuver is\nnecessary. In addition to the previously mentioned\nnavigation capability required for remote inspection,\na very precise resolution in determining the relative\nposition of the two vehicles is particularly essential for\ndocking maneuvers. This can be accomplished with\nexact distance measurements, but, ideally, with the aid\nof optical cameras and appropriate image processing.\nWhether a docking procedure is handled automati-\ncally or controlled from Earth mainly depends on the\ncommunication links from and to the service satellite,\nwhich are determined by the orbit.\n\nTarget satellites can be of constant attitude and sta-\ntus if their attitude control system is functional. This\nsignificantly reduces the effort involved in tracking\nthe target and especially in docking maneuvers. A\ndeactivated satellite may have an axial rotation around\nits longitudinal axis (a typical state after the so-called\npassivation) or may be tumbling randomly. In either\ncase high demands are made on the maneuvering,\nnavigation and docking capabilities of the service\nsatellite. As a rule, such objects are approached only\n\n2/25/09 3:52:17 PM\n",

So far, the target satellites have usually been\npassive and unequipped with interfaces for satellite\nservicing. Investigations are in progress to equip\nunmanned space vehicles with active interfaces in\norder to establish a variety of connections between\ntarget and service satellite for carrying out servicing\noperations.\n\nThe next level of complexity in on-orbit servicing\nis moving the target satellite with the help of the\ndocked service satellite, usually to take over the task\nof attitude and orbit control, or to deliberately change\nits orbit. The precondition is a successful docking\nprocedure. In order to move the combined system, the\nservice satellite undertakes variable thrust vectoring\nin order to efficiently utilize the available fuel, taking\ninto account the momentary location of the center of\nmass of the combined system. The amount of propul-\nsion power is not decisive; rather this influences the\ninertia of the attitude control system.\n\nThe most profitable application for the already\nmentioned and yet to be mentioned types of on-orbit\nservicing is docking with telecommunications satel-\nlites at EOL and taking over their attitude and orbit\ncontrol for a number of years in order to maintain\nprofitable telecommunication services. Secondary\nto this is the salvaging of new, stranded telecommu-\nnications satellites which, because of the failure of a\nlaunch vehicle stage or of their own apogee motor,\ncannot reach their target orbit on their own. Such\na rescue maneuver only makes sense if these usually\nexpensive satellites are put into their target orbit at\na cost that is considerably lower than the otherwise\nexpected insurance sum.\n\nWhereas technical solutions for the systems named\nso far (also for overall systems) have already been\ndevised, some of which have even been demonstrated,\nthe following on-orbit services are yet to be realized\nsince they require appropriate active interfaces. As\nmentioned, only the next generation of satellites is\napt to have such interfaces. In any event, the idea is\nto have as many types of interfaces as possible, such\nas electrical, mechanical, thermal, radiofrequency and\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:639\n\n639\n\nalso interfaces for transferring fluids and gases. In par-\nticular, refueling of orbiting spacecraft is probably the\nmost lucrative aspect of the named scenario because\nit fully restores the target satellite function and, after\nthe refueling procedure, the service satellite is free to\nattend to other tasks at other targets. The automatic\nhandling of connectors in orbit is technically possible\nif the respective robotic capability is fully available.\nThe capabilities of robots on the ground are well\nknown and have been demonstrated. But to carry out\nthese kinds of tasks in orbit, the technologies have to\nbe adapted to different marginal and environmental\nconditions. Reliability must also be extremely high\nsince the service satellite should not itself become a\nrepair case.\n\nBesides the automatic handling of connectors,\nthe exchange of modules is probably the last link in\nthe chain of applications described here. The service\nlife of a satellite is defined not only by its fuel sup-\nply and consumption, but also by the lifetime of its\nsubsystems. If such subsystems can be so integrated\ninto satellites in the future that they are accessible\nfrom outside, they could be exchanged by a robot arm.\nExamples are reaction wheels and gyroscopes which\nare subject to mechanical wear, or even the periodic\nreplacement of precision clocks on-board the Galileo\nsatellites to keep them at the state of the art and to\nincrease signal precision.\n\nIn the context of on-orbit servicing, the automated\nassembly of large structures and instruments which\ncannot be launched in one piece or put into orbit\nand then unfolded should be mentioned. This future\nscenario of automation in space with the help of\nrobotics will in the long run determine accessibility\nto outer space.\n\nThe first consideration when designing service\nsatellites is to decide between single service and\nmultiple service capability. The constructions dif-\nfer in architecture, logistic support and financing\nmodels. There is little doubt that multimission\nservice satellites are more useful for emergency\noperations. Many configurations include in-orbit\ndepots for consumables or supplies. From the ser-\nvicing perspective, the ISS offers an ideal platform\nfrom which to initiate on-orbit servicing or provide\nan ideal environment for the servicing itself, as it\n\n7\n\n2/24/09 2:43:28 PM\n",

For\nevery rendezvous and docking mission it is pro-\nbable that manipulators will connect the spacecraft\nto the target satellite. In addition, navigational\ncapability and a certain degree of autonomy are\ndesirable for most operating scenarios,\n\nService Satellite Payload: This payload is strongly\ndependent on the particular mission purpose and\ncan have such elements as docking mechanisms, sen-\nsors, actuators, manipulators, control software, etc.\nTarget Satellite: This satellite usually determines\nthe mission and operations scenario. The first mis-\nsions should be based on already existing satellites.\nOnly in the future target satellites will be equipped\nwith on-orbit servicing elements.\n\nLaunch: Asa satellite launch is an extremely expen-\nsive affair, an important element in the configurati-\non of operations scenarios is cost reduction. Costs\ncan be reduced by using a single (or reusable) low-\ncost launcher. Another possibility to reduce costs\nwould be to use dual-launch systems or a piggyback\n\nsolution, as with the Ariane 5 rocket,\n\ne Ground Segment: On-orbit servicing requires\na suitably equipped ground station or a ground\nstation network to monitor and control the service\nsatellite.\n\ne Logistics: Finally, the global on-orbit servicing\nscenario determines the number of service satel-\nlites required in orbit and their parking position,\nas well as what supplies or replacement modules\nare to be stored and carried.\n\n7.7.2.4 Technological Requirements\n\nThe technologies required for the on-orbit components\n\ndescribed above must meet certain requirements:\n\ne Payload: The robotic elements required for each\nparticular mission scenario must satisfy high\ndemands as to precision and reliability. Such systems\nhave long been available in the laboratory. The\nchallenge is to make the complex robotic system\nsuitable for the space environment. In most cases\nthere is no redundancy for primary elements like\nthe docking mechanism and manipulator arm. In\norder to increase reliability, elaborate ground tes-\nting under the most realistic conditions possible as\nwell as the use of robust components are therefore\nnecessary. The specialized fields to be addressed are\nelectronics, mechanics and mechatronics,\n\ne Sensor Technology: In order to carry out in space\nthe operations described above, corresponding\nsensor equipment has to be on-board. It serves on\nthe one hand to grasp the target satellite in the ren-\ndezvous phase and on the other hand to determine\nas precisely as possible after approach the attitudes\nand relative positions of both the service and target\n\n2/24/09 2:43:28 PM\n",
    "662": "7.7 New Technologies and Robotics\n\nsatellites during docking or close-up inspection. It\nis therefore desirable to work with optical cameras\nwhich can be used for object recognition as well\nas inspection tasks.\n\ne Platform: There are high requirements placed\non the Av budget, which directly determines the\nlifetime and efficiency of the service satellite. The\nplatform also requires an extremely precise and\nadjustable propulsion system when near the target\nand for the docking maneuver. In addition, all the\nclassic elements have to be on hand to control the\nservice satellite and maintain communication with\nthe ground station. If video data is used, an approp-\nriately powerful ground link has to be available.\n\ne Software: High demands are placed on the soft-\nware algorithms which must be able to close the\ncontrol circuit between the sensor and actuator\ntechnology (attitude regulation, mechanisms), for\nsome operations, fully autonomously and in real\ntime. Rapid processing of sensor data and com-\nparison with available models are key elements in\nautonomous robotic activities in space.\n\ne Operations: Anything which the service satellite\ncannot carry out fully autonomously must be\ncontrolled by appropriate operation commands\nfrom the ground. This includes primarily the\ncomplete approach and rendezvous phase as well\nas the first part of the docking phase. Since there\nis always a high risk of collision, the design and\nverification of these operations must be carried\nout with extraordinary care.\n\n7.7.2.5 Influencing Factors\n\nThe organization of a service mission is determined\n\nby many important factors:\n\ne Requirements on the Service Satellite: These\ndepend on the particular servicing scenario. For\na nongeostationary constellation in several orbital\nplanes (e.g. Galileo), fuel limitations require at\nleast one service satellite per orbit plane. But the\nnumber of target satellites and the complexity of\nthe servicing tasks could make it necessary to have\nseveral service satellites in each plane.\n\ne Frequency: This depends on the planning of\nnominal events and assessment of unscheduled\nevents. If maintenance is an integral part of the\nmission (attitude regulation, refueling, regular\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:641\n\n641\n\nupgrades), frequent visits are essential for the\nsuccess of the mission.\n\ne Rendezvous and Docking: RvD places high de-\nmands on the design and the payload. The number\nand type of robotic elements have to be defined.\nIn addition, the docking speed influences the de-\nsign of the docking mechanism. Low speeds are\ndesirable to avoid damage, but they require more\nfuel. An appropriate sensor regime is also needed\nto improve the precision of the docking maneuver\nand thereby reduce the probability of collision.\n\ne Orbit and Inclination: The design is primarily\ndetermined by the particular orbit. Service satellites\ncrossing the Van Allen belt, in some cases several\ntimes, require additional radiation protection,\nwhich affects cost and mass. The number of launch\nopportunities is also an important consideration\nsince dual or piggyback starts are less expensive.\nThere are frequent launches particularly for the\ngeostationary transfer orbits, and many satellites in\ngeostationary orbit are potential on-orbit servicing\ncandidates.\n\ne Availability: Servicing according to a schedule is\neasier, since the service satellite only has to trans-\nport equipment and fittings for defined situations\nand it is known in advance which operations are to\nbe performed. An emergency operation is, by com-\nparison, more difficult since it could be necessary\nto first carry out inspections and failure search,\nfollowed by repair as necessary and possible, tasks\nfor which the client satellite may not be designed\n(e.g., cutting through insulation layers).\n\ne Logistics (Consumables): Logistics are an impor-\ntant factor in a servicing mission. For example, a\nservicer can be constructed to transport one or two\nreplacement modules or even large, completely\nfull fuel tanks for refueling operations.\n\n7.7.2.6 Past and Planned Mission Examples\n\nA brief survey follows of past and future missions\nwhich include servicing tasks in space. Although\ncompleteness is not claimed, the survey is, however,\nfairly representative.\n\nSNAP-1\nOne of the first European service satellites, which only\nhad the task of inspection, was the British SNAP-1.\n\n2/24/09 2:43:28 PM\n",

SNAP-1 was launched\nin 2000 and made successful close-up approaches\nof the Russian Nadeshda satellite (Figure 7.7.33) as\nwell as, from a considerably greater distance, of the\nChinese Tsinghua-1 satellite. This mission also served\nto demonstrate nanosatellite technology and had a\nrelatively small budget.\n\nSuch free-flying inspection systems were consi-\ndered especially for the ISS, which would have been a\nvery interesting and certainly useful application. But to\ndate none of the plans have been realized, both because\nof lacking financial support and, more importantly,\nbecause the risk that such a system might collide with\nthe station could not be fully eliminated, and the safety\nof the station and its crew has priority.\n\nDART\nNASA's so-called Demonstrator for Autonomous\nRendezvous Technology (DART) was an experiment\nto demonstrate new technologies in orbit necessary\nfor localizing and approaching a target satellite\n(Figure 7.7.34).

Because of\nproblems with the fuel supply there was an unnoticed\nand uncontrollable collision with the target satellite.\nThe main reason for the failure of the rendezvous\nphase was navigation based on GPS, which turned\nout to be unreliable for such a mission task.\n\nETS-VII\n\nThe Japanese ETS-VII mission (Engineering Test\nSatellite; Figure 7.7.35) of 1997 is to date the most\ncomplex successful technological demonstration\nof a service mission [7.7.1]. It was carried out in a\n550 km altitude orbit under the responsibility of the\nJapanese space agency NASDA (now JAXA). The ser-\nvice satellite, named ORIHIME, weighed 2.5 tonnes\nand the target satellite, HIKOBOSHI, 0.4 tonnes.\nThe manipulator arm was 2 meters long and had six\ndegrees of freedom. With the help of various availa-\nble robotic technologies, basic tasks were tested like\nautonomous rendezvous and docking with a target\nsatellite, control of the manipulator arm via teleo-\nperation, and force-feedback control. Germany has\ncontributed its GETEX experiment to the ETS-VII\nmission, see Section 7.7.1.2.\n\nOrbital Express\nOrbital Express (Figure 7.7.36) was a project financed\nby DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects\n\n2/24/09 2:43:29 PM\n\n\u00ae\n",

The mission was launched in March 2007.\nAstro as the service satellite and NextSat as the target\nsatellite were brought into orbit at the same time and\nthen separated in order to initiate the actual techno-\nlogy demonstration, beginning with rendezvous and\ndocking. This elaborately prepared project represents\na complete on-orbit-servicing scenario and is thus a\nmilestone in the history of space activities. Especially,\nthe joining of different types of connections (me-\nchanical, thermal, electrical, radiofrequency, liquid,\ngaseous) posed enormous challenges, in addition to\nthe complex tasks of rendezvous and docking and\ncontrolling the manipulator arm.\n\nIn Europe an ESA study is currently underway to\ninvestigate criteria involved in joining the different\nconnections of a service and a target satellite, but in\nthis case with the sole goal of defining future interfaces\nand identifying appropriate technical concepts for\nnext-generation communications satellites.\n\nFREND (SUMO)\n\nFREND, formerly SUMO, is the designation for the sec-\nond DARPA service mission besides Orbital Express.\nIts primary goal is to demonstrate the maneuvering\nand repositioning of orbiting satellites [7.7.3]. Various\naspects of service life prolongation and controlled\ndeorbiting are also to be investigated. A significant\nfeature is that the service satellite uses manipulator\n\nCHO7.indd Sec1:643\n\n643\n\nFigure 7.7.36: Orbital Express (Source: DARPA/Boeing).\n\narms to capture the target satellite without requiring\ninterfaces to the target satellite, so that any target\nsatellite can be approached. This mission accordingly\nrepresents another improvement, especially when\ncompared to Orbital Express, which made use of\ndocking interfaces on the service and target satellites.\nFREND also has the goal of carrying out such opera-\ntions for the first time in geostationary orbit.\n\nTECSAS and DEOS\n\nTogether with foreign partners, in 2006 Germany\ncarried out a first study for a robot-supported service\nmission named TECSAS to demonstrate technology in\norbit (Figure 7.7.37). This mission was similar to the\nOrbital Express mission launched in March 2007. It\nconsisted of a service satellite and a target in orbit to\nbe connected with the help of a robot arm.\n\nFor programmatic reasons this project was not\ncontinued, but it is being redefined under the name\nDEOS and will be a purely national mission. In\ncontrast to TECSAS the robot arm for manipula-\ntion and capturing of an uncontrolled satellite will\nbe supplemented by a docking tool developed by\nDLR which links the service satellite and the target\nin space. As was originally planned for TECSAS,\nDEOS is to operate in LEO, which makes special\ndemands on the communication link with the ground\nbecause only short contact times exist during each\n\n2/24/09 2:43:30 PM\n",

The possibility of carrying out communications\nvia so-called relay satellites in order to maintain per-\nmanent contact is being considered. This German\ntechnology mission will provide many possibilities\nto test and verify a variety of robotic operations in\nspace and demonstrate the capabilities of German\nindustry and science.\n\nOLEV\nA special case of orbital servicing, the service life pro-\nlongation of geostationary satellites, is being currently\ninvestigated by a European commercial consortium\nunder the leadership of Orbital Satellite Services\nLtd [7.7.4]. With the participation of the industrial\npartners Kayser-Threde GmbH (responsible for the\ndocking payload [7.7.5]), Swedish Space Corporation\n(responsible for the platform) and the Spanish Sener\nLtda (responsible for the hardware and software of\nthe guidance and navigation control system) a pro-\nposal with the name of OLEV (Orbital Life Extension\nVehicle) is being finalized and is close to realization.\nThe concept was originally developed on the basis\nof the ConeXpress platform (see Figure 7.7.38) but\nnow a modified platform resembling SMART-1 is\npreferred, primarily to minimize development costs\n(see Figure 7.7.39).\n\nThis application is based on the capture of ope-\nrating geostationary communications satellites using\n\n7 Utilization of Space\n\nFigure 7.7.38: CX-OLEV (Source: Dutch Space/Orbital Recovery\nGroup).\n\nFigure 7.7.39: SMART-OLEV (Source: Swedish Space Corporation).\n\na DLR multisensory capture tool (see Figure 7.7.9)\nwith which practically any of these satellites whose\ncold gas supply is running low can be grasped via\n\n2/24/09 2:43:33 PM\n",

Their attitude\ncan then be stabilized for years with a set of electric\npropulsion engines provided by the service satellite.\nThe challenge is not only in the docking and con-\nnecting procedure but also, and primarily, in the\noperations scenario. For a system consisting of two\nbodies with a common center of mass outside the\nservice satellite, the orbit and attitude regulation has\nto be carried out using only the engines of the service\nsatellite, which induce unavoidable coupling effects\n(and the associated losses) for each correction ma-\nneuver. These have to be skillfully compensated over\nan entire orbit. The main difference to the missions\ndescribed above in LEO is the significantly longer\ncommunication period with the service satellite. This\nmakes it possible to command special operational\ntasks as well as routine control and safety tasks from\nthe ground.\n\nIn contrast to the prior examples for technolo-\ngy demonstration missions, the project is entirely\ncommercial.

    "669": "CHO8.indd 648\n\n648\n\n8.1.1.1 The Mission Objective\n\nThe mission objective includes the reason for and\npurpose of the space mission, the goal and the subject\nof the mission, as well as its benefits. The mission\nobjective can be, for example, operational weather\nmonitoring for weather service organizations or in-\nvestigation of phenomena on the Earth\u2019s surface or\nin deep space for scientific establishments or other\ninstitutions. In these cases the mission subject would\nbe the Earth\u2019s surface or deep space.\n\n8.1.1.2 The Mission Concept\n\nThe mission concept includes the development, in-\n\ntegration and testing, implementation, operations\n\nand the disposal of the space mission. It comprises\n\nthe following:\n\ne Concept for the accomplishment and utilization\nof the mission objective\n\ne Technical plan for implementing the mission with\nall mission elements\n\ne Mission operations concept\n\ne Management concept\n\ne Rough time schedule for mission implementa-\ntion\n\ne Rough cost plan\n\ne Financing concept.\n\nA few papers and references do not describe the mis-\nsion concept as part of the mission elements because\nof its nontechnical character.\n\n8.1.1.3 The Launch Element\n\nThe launch element is the space transportation system\nfor putting the space element into space. It consists of\nthe rocket, including its upper stages, the launch pad,\nthe launch facility, integration buildings, the launch\ncontrol center, technical equipment, and facilities\nfor the ground support of the payload and launcher\nduring the launch and its campaign (see also Chapter\n3). An important part of the launch element is the\nlaunch strategy: whether it is a question of a dedi-\ncated single launch, or a shared launch between two\npayloads, or a launch as auxiliary payload together\nwith the main payload (so-called \u201cpiggyback\u201d launch).\nThis opportunity can be used only for small satellites\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nwith a total mass of less than approx. 150kg. The\nmain advantage is the relatively low launch costs (in\nthe order of 15000 to 20000 euros/kg payload mass\n(22000-29000 dollars/kg)), because these costs are\nmostly paid by the main payload customer of the\nlauncher. The main disadvantage is in the fixed orbit\nconditions determined by the main payload. For the\nselection of the launch element technical parameters\nlike the environmental conditions for the payload\non the launch pad and during the launch, geome-\ntrical requirements for the payload (footprint and\nshape of the payload, maximum dimensions), mass\nproperties, mechanical, electrical, electromagnetic\nand data interface requirements between payload\nand upper stage of the launcher, and others must be\ndefined in addition to the orbit insertion parameters\nand tolerances. Further important parameters of the\nlaunch element are access to or connection with the\nintegrated payload, and the environmental conditions\nfor the payload on the launch pad.\n\n8.1.1.4 Orbit and Constellation\n\nThe orbit of a space mission is the selected ellipsoid\n\nor circular flight path around the Earth. There are\n\nseveral types of orbits, differing in some basic para-\n\nmeters, namely:\n\nLEO \u2014 Low Earth Orbit\n\nMEO - Medium Earth Orbit\n\nGEO - Geosynchronous Earth Orbit\n\nHEO - Highly inclined Elliptical Orbit (also called\nMolniya orbit).\n\nSome characteristic parameters of the different orbit\n\ntypes are given in Table 8.1.1.\n\nClassifying the orbits by functional criteria, they\ncan be divided into:\n\ne Injection orbit, the orbit achieved at the time of\nseparation between upper stage and payload.\n\ne Parking orbit, the orbit in which the spacecraft\ncoasts temporarily without propulsion before it is\nreaccelerated to reach its destination orbit.\n\ne Transfer orbit, the orbit or orbit segment used\nby the spacecraft to transfer from the initial orbit\nto a target orbit; for example, the geostationary\ntransfer orbit (GTO) is a Hohmann orbit used\nto transfer a satellite from a low Earth orbit into\na geosynchronous orbit.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:10 PM\n",

Every\ngeostationary satellite has to leave its position af-\nter the end of the mission and move hundreds of\nkilometers upward, out of geostationary orbit.\n\nA satellite constellation is a geometric arrangement of\nat least two satellites in given fixed orbits without any\nautonomous on-board orbit control and dedicated\nto the same mission objectives. Usually a constellati-\non of identical satellites is implemented in space to\nincrease the spatial and time coverage of the Earth.\nSatellite constellations are already established for\ncommunications (e.g., Iridium), for Earth observation\n(e.g., RapidEye, disaster monitoring constellations),\nfor navigation (e.g., GPS, GLONASS and in the fu-\nture Galileo) and for other objectives (e.g., military\nobjectives).\n\nA satellite formation is a geometric arrangement\nof at least two satellites in a given orbit or in relatively\nclose orbits with a closed loop on-board orbit control.\nThe satellite formation is dedicated to one mission\nobjective. It is often called formation flying or a\nsatellite cluster (e.g., GRACE).\n\n8.1.1.5 The Space Element\n\nThe space element is the central element for achieving\nthe mission objectives. It can be a single spacecraft\nor an arrangement of spacecraft in a constellation or\nformation. The space element can be a Space Shuttle,\na reentry capsule, the space station or one of its mo-\ndules, a satellite, or an interplanetary spacecraft. In\n\nCHO8.indd 649\n\nFigure 8.1.1 the space element is a satellite. A satellite\nis defined here as an artificial unmanned celestial body\norbiting the Earth. In contrast, an artificial unmanned\ncelestial body leaving an orbit around the Earth is\ncalled a space probe. Both vehicles, having their own\npropulsion system, are also called spacecraft.\n\nA satellite consists of the bus and payload. The\nsatellite bus comprises all subsystems necessary to\nsupport the payload and the satellite bus itself in\nspace. It keeps the payload mechanically stable in\nthe desired direction relative to the bus structure;\nit puts the payload into the target orbit and keeps\norbital position; it keeps the satellite in defined atti-\ntude modes and executes attitude maneuvers; and it\nsupplies the satellite with electrical power, controls the\nthermal regulation, assures the reception, decoding\nand execution of commands, organizes the acquisiti-\non, recording and transmission of housekeeping data\n(telemetry data) from the subsystems and the payload,\nas well as the payload data. The payload of a satellite\nis dedicated to fulfilling the mission objectives. It\ncould be a single scientific instrument, an instrument\ncomplex for intricate research objectives, a system\nof transponders for communication purposes, an\ninstrument for operational weather observation, or\nany number of other options.\n\n8.1.1.6 The Communication Architecture\n\nThe communication architecture describes the me-\nthod of communication between the space segment\nand the ground segment and the arrangement of all\nthe necessary elements. The communication archi-\ntecture of a mission can include different commu-\nnication modes on different communication paths,\nfor example, voice communication in the UHF band,\nvideo communication in the S-band, telemetry and\n\n2/24/09 2:50:11 PM\n",
    "671": "CHO8.indd 650\n\n650\n\ntelecommand data in the S-band and instrument\ndata in the X-band. The communication architecture\ndescribes the interrelationship of all communication\nelements, paths and systems of a mission. The basic\nmission elements arranged in the communication ar-\nchitecture are the space element, the ground stations,\nthe mission control center and the mission operations\nconcept. In the architecture scheme the main data\nflows, such as the command, telemetry and payload\ndata flows, are defined.\n\nDifferent criteria can be used to define the com-\nmunication architecture, for example according to\nthe satellite-ground geometry, or the functions to\nbe performed. Based on the data distribution prin-\nciple, the satellite communication architecture can\nbe distinguished as a point-to-point connection or\nas broadcast communication.\n\nPoint-to-point architecture is characterized by a\nlink between the space element and one ground sta-\ntion, either directly or via relay satellite, for the trans-\nmission of commands, telemetry or science data.\n\nBroadcast architecture is distinguished by the\nnondirectional transmission of data, telemetry or\ncommands to many receiving stations, directly or via\nrelay satellite. The transmitter might be one single\nground station or a single satellite and the receivers\nmight be many satellites or many ground stations.\n\nBoth of these architectures are a coarse classi-\nfication of communication architectures that can\nbe further classified in more detail according to the\nspecific function. With reference to the main archi-\ntecture classification, the following features can be\ndistinguished:\n\ne Store-and-forward Communication: Data or\nmessages from one or several ground stations are\nreceived and buffered by the space element for a\ncertain time (distance) and then transmitted to\nthe target ground station(s) as a point-to-point\nconnection or as a broadcast service.\n\ne Telemetry and Telecommand Communication:\nThe telemetry data of the space element is trans-\nmitted directly or via relay satellite to a single\nground station (point-to-point) or to different\nground stations (broadcast); the commands are\ntransmitted from a ground station to a single\nsatellite (point-to-point) or to several satellites\n(broadcast).\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\ne Data Collection Architecture: Data is collected\nfrom the ground by satellite sensors or commu-\nnication systems and transmitted directly or via\nrelay satellite to a single ground station (point-\nto-point), or distributed via broadcast within the\nreceiving range.\n\ne Data Relay Architecture: A relay satellite transmits\ndata from a ground station or from a satellite to\none (point-to-point) or to several (broadcast)\nground stations.\n\n8.1.1.7 Satellite Ground Stations\n\nSatellite ground stations comprise the transmitting\n\nand receiving systems on the ground for communi-\n\ncation with the satellite. A satellite ground station\nconsists of:\n\ne A controllable antenna for receiving telemetry\nand payload data from the space segment and for\ntransmitting commands.\n\ne An antenna control system for orientating and\npointing the directed antenna to track the satellite.\nThe satellite tracking mode can be accomplished\nin two ways: \u201cprogram tracking\u201d uses calculated\nflight path data and \u201cautotracking\u201d uses the recei-\nved signal power.\n\ne Anantenna feed with the radiofrequency part of\nthe receiver or transmitter, including a low-noise\namplifier (LNA) for received signals, and often\nincluding a downconverter within the receiving sig-\nnal chain to convert the high-frequency signal into\nan intermediate frequency (IF) for transmitting the\nsignal to the receiver unit with low signal losses.\n\ne Areceiver unit with a demodulator and sometimes\nwith a bit synchronizer and a frame synchronizer\nfor digital signals.\n\ne A transmitter unit with high-frequency genera-\ntor, modulator, upconverter and high-frequency\namplifier.\n\nIf more than one ground station is used for one space\nmission, then that ground station will be defined as the\nprimary ground station and the others as secondary\nground stations.\n\nThe main ground station assures complete satel-\nlite control in the nominal case. The other ground\nstations receive the telemetry and payload data and,\ndepending on the mission, assure the operation of\n\n2/24/09 2:50:11 PM\n",

This could be the Internet, or it might\nconsist of dedicated leased lines.\n\n8.1.1.8 Mission Control Center and Mission\nOperations\n\nThe mission control center, sometimes called the\nspace flight control center, is the focus for planning\nand operating the mission. It is the technical instituti-\non for monitoring and controlling the space element\nin space and time, as well as the appropriate ground\nelements and resources. It is responsible for assuring\na stable link between the space element and the user\nor space service provider via a ground station or a\nground station network. The mission control center\nof a satellite mission can be identical to the space\ncraft control center, monitoring and commanding\nall subsystems of a spacecraft and controlling and\noperating the spacecraft bus in space and time. The\nthird necessary element for the control of a satellite\nmission is the payload control center. It performs\nthe same tasks as the spacecraft control center, but\nis dedicated to the payload of the satellite. It can be\nintegrated within the mission control center and it\ncan also be locally separated from the spacecraft and\nmission control centers.\n\nAn integrated mission control center, which in-\ncludes the satellite and the payload control center,\nconsists of the following main facilities:\n\ne Command System: A database-driven system\nwith all commands and command parameters and\nwith a man\u2014machine interface for mission control\n(control of the spacecraft and payload).\n\ne Telemetry System: A database-driven system with\nall telemetry values and automated checks and\nlimit controls and with a man\u2014machine interface\nfor mission control (control of the spacecraft and\npayload).\n\ne Archive System: Permanent storage of all received\ntelemetry data and transmitted commands.\n\ne Off-line Analysis System: For the systematic\nevaluation and analysis of historical telemetry\ndata according to preselected criteria, and for\nthe analysis of trends related to the equipment,\nsubsystems and payload.\n\nCHO8.indd 651\n\n651\n\ne Data Transmission System: To maintain the link\nbetween all ground elements.\n\ne Mission Planning System: To gather the operatio-\nnal user requirements and plan the mission opera-\ntions according to these requirements, taking into\naccount relevant constraints like visibility condi-\ntions for optical sensors, flight path parameters,\nenergy budget of the spacecraft, available on-board\npayload data storage capacity, parameters of the\nnext ground station contacts, and other factors.\n\nThe mission operations executed by the mission con-\n\ntrol center comprise the following tasks:\n\ne Mission planning concerns all activities to collect\nthe user requirements, to establish the time sche-\ndule for the operation of the ground station(s),\nto generate the command files, to support special\nrequirements from users or mission control, to\ncompute orbit and ephemeris data, to operate and\nuse the links, and to analyze capacity utilization,\namong other things.\n\ne Mission operations for the space element, which\nmeans commanding the spacecraft, monitoring\nthe status of all subsystems, payload management,\noperation of the data acquisition systems of the\nspacecraft, reacting to spacecraft anomalies, and\ntrend analysis related to the spacecraft\u2019s equipment\nand subsystems.\n\ne Instruction and training of the operations team,\nincluding the development of training courses,\ntraining on simulators, training on spacecraft and\nfurther education.\n\ne Scientific and technological support for the de-\nveloper of the space element, especially during the\ndesign, implementation, integration and testing\nactivities, planning orbital maneuvers, subsystem\nmanagement, payload management, power ma-\nnagement, reaction to anomalies, supervision of\nthe flight software, supervision of the simulator\n(if available), maintenance of the databases of the\nground station and mission control center, and\ntrend analysis of the spacecraft.\n\n8.1.1.9 Data Processing, Archiving and\nDistribution\n\nSpace missions to gather scientific, operational\nor administrative data need technical facilities for\n\n2/24/09 2:50:11 PM\n",

This makes it possible to\ndivide the entire space mission into just a few major\nsegments. With their help, the complex interrelati-\nonships of a space mission can be more easily and\ngenerally described. Often a space mission is divided\ninto three segments: the launch segment, the space\nsegment and the ground segment. But other arran-\ngements are also possible. In [8.1.1] an additional\nprogram segment is introduced so that four segments\nof a satellite mission can be defined:\n\ne Launch segment, comprising the launch system,\nthe launch service and the necessary infrastruc-\nture.\n\ne Space segment, comprising the development of\nall spacecraft equipment, the payload, the system\nengineering activities and tests.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\ne Ground segment, including the ground in-\nfrastructure, the equipment, the hardware and\nsoftware for linking the space segment and the\nmission control center, and the data processing\nand archiving facilities.\n\ne Program segment, including project manage-\nment, project coordination, product assurance,\ninterfaces, project organization and planning of\nresources.\n\nThis general division of a space mission into seg-\nments is modified depending on the character of the\nmission.\n\nFor example, the missions of the global naviga-\ntion satellite system (GNSS) are divided into three\nsegments. The segments of a GNSS are:\n\ne Space segment with a constellation of navigation\nsatellites.\n\ne Control segment that provides and operates the\nsystem.\n\ne User segment, consisting of the different user of\nthe navigation signals.\n\nThe launch segment (the space transportation system)\nis completely disregarded here, because the segmen-\ntation was done under functional aspects from the\nusers\u2019 point of view. The launch segment is needed\nonly for implementation; it has no direct relevance\nto functions for the users.\n\nAnother kind of mission segmentation is done for\nEarth observation missions. Typical segments of an\nEarth observation mission are:\n\ne The space segment, one or more satellites in\norbit.\n\ne The ground segment, comprising the complete\ninfrastructure and the staff for mission opera-\ntions. The ground segment consists of the main\nelements: one or more ground stations, the space\nmission control center, the mission operation\nfacilities and the ground data system connecting\nthe elements mentioned above. The organization\nof communications with the spacecraft is defined\nby the communication architecture and depends\non the mission requirements and constraints.\n\ne The service segment includes the user, as defined\nwithin the ESA GMES program, and consists of the\nfacilities for ground data processing archiving and\n\n2/24/09 2:50:12 PM\n",

It includes the mission objectives, program\nand constraints; the quality assurance philosophy;\nthe technical and management plans; the time sche-\ndule; the expense and financing proposal; and basic\nreference documents (requirements documentation,\nutilization plan and others).\n\n8.1.3 The Mission Architecture\n\nThe mission architecture describes how the main\nelements of a space mission are related. In Figure 8.1.2\nthe interrelationship between the main elements of\nthe BIRD mission is depicted as an example. BIRD\nis a small satellite mission of the German Aerospace\nCenter (DLR) for in-orbit verification of new tech-\nnologies and for remote sensing of fires from space\n[8.1.2]. The mission is being accomplished exclusively\nwith a German ground segment.\n\nThe architecture depicted in Figure 8.1.2 shows the\ndifferent interrelationships of the space segment with\nthe ground segment. The DLR ground station at Neu-\nstrelitz is a receiving station only, without any options\nto command the spacecraft. Systematic data processing\nand archiving of the BIRD payload data is also carried\nout in Neustrelitz (not depicted in Figure 8.1.2). The\nmission control center in Oberpfaffenhofen operates\nthe satellite via the DLR ground station in Weilheim,\nwhich has both uplink and downlink facilities. The\nusers consist of an international investigating team\ncoordinated by the DLR in Berlin-Adlershof. This\nteam arranges for test fires, for example, and then\nmonitors them with remote sensing instruments on\nboth aircraft and satellites for data validation and\ncomparing to ground measurements made during a\nsatellite overpass. The experimental ground station\nin Berlin-Adlershof demonstrates the possibility of\n\nCHO8.indd 653\n\n653\n\nearly warning of fires with a tailored low-cost satellite\nreceiving station that can be rapidly installed at any\nlocation on Earth.\n\n8.1.4 Development of a Mission\nConcept and a Mission\nArchitecture\n\nThe mission concept and the mission architecture\nshow the interaction of the space mission elements.\nThe development and planning of the interrelati-\nonships needed to fulfill the mission objectives are\naccomplished in successive steps. This process is\ndescribed in the following using the small satellite\nmission BIRD as an example. The definition of the\nsteps is as in [8.1.3].\n\n8.1.4.1 The Mission Statement\n\nAt the beginning of a space mission the mission state-\n\nment is drawn up. It is formulated in a few sentences\n\nonly and contains three core statements:\n\ne The motivation for the mission, which means the\nrationale and the initial situation.\n\ne The mission statement or the mission idea, which\nmeans how the mission elements interact.\n\ne The user or user groups of the mission.\n\n7\u201d BIRD SS\n\nWeilheim\n. experimental mission\ndata reception ground station control\nstation\nBerlin center\nNeustrelitz Oberpfaffenhofen\nsciences\u2019\nteam\n\naircraft field experiments ground\n\nexperiments measurements\n\nFigure 8.1.2: Mission architecture of the BIRD mission.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:12 PM\n",
    "675": "CHO8.indd 654\n\n654\n\nThe mission statement should contain self-expla-\nnatory sentences and be clearly understandable to\neverybody.\n\nExample of a Mission Statement\n\nBecause of the increasing impact of fires on forest\nand savannah ecosystems and on the atmosphere\nand climate, the global acquisition and measurement\nof fire parameters in space and time is of increasing\nimportance. A dedicated satellite system with global\ncoverage for daily acquisition and surveying of fire\ndata in the regions concerned supports the daily\nbriefing of those engaged in the management of major\nfires and the investigation of their implications by\nscientists, local authorities, organizations and insu-\nrance companies.\n\nSuch a spaceborne sensor system can also detect\nand support the remote sensing of other high-tem-\nperature phenomena like volcanic activity and can\nprovide unique data for scientists and government\nadministrators.\n\n8.1.4.2 Definition of the Mission Objectives\n\nThe overall goal of the mission has already been for-\nmulated in the mission statement, which is a popular\ndescription. In a next step the mission objectives\nare precisely formulated, defined and described in\ndetail. It is necessary that the customer, the mission\ndeveloper and the foreseen mission operator develop\n\na common understanding of the mission objectives.\n\nIt can be useful to introduce a flat hierarchy into the\n\nmission objectives by a priority definition related to\n\nthe different objectives (e.g., a division into primary\nand secondary mission objectives). The concept of\nthe space mission is derived from the requirements\nand constraints of the mission. The requirements are\nderived from the mission objectives.\n\nExample of the Definition of Mission Objectives\n\n(adapted from [8.1.2])\n\nThe primary mission objectives are:\n\ne Test and space demonstration of a new generation\nof infrared sensors with an adaptive dynamic range\nfor Earth observation\n\ne Detection and scientific investigation from space\nof high-temperature events like vegetation fires,\nvolcanic activities and coal seam fires\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\ne Test and demonstration of new small satellite\ntechnologies.\n\nThe secondary mission objectives are:\n\ne Test and demonstration of an on-board classifi-\ncation of remote sensing data using an artificial\nneural network classification method.\n\ne Test and demonstration of an experimental ground\nstation for immediate satellite data reception by\nthe final user.\n\n8.1.4.3 Definition of User Needs\n\nOnce the mission objectives have been formulated,\nthe substantiated user needs are identified. Users can\nbe roughly divided into three different main groups:\nscientific users, commercial users and governmental\nusers. The needs of scientific users can be identified\nby calls for mission proposals or contributions. The\nneeds of commercial users can be gathered by requests\nfor proposals, though they are often more easily\ndetermined in user interviews with prepared questi-\nonnaires or at user conferences. The same methods\nare suitable for collecting and quantifying the needs of\ngovernmental users. A detailed analysis of user needs\ncan lead to the modification of the mission objectives.\nAfter adjusting the objectives to the final user needs,\nthe mission requirements can be derived.\n\n8.1.4.4 Definition of Mission Requirements\nand Constraints\n\nThe mission requirements can be structured into\nfunctional and operational requirements. Functional\nrequirements describe the tasks and essential per-\nformance parameters necessary to fulfill the mission\nobjectives. The operational mission requirements\ndescribe the operational concept of the system for\nfulfilling the mission objectives and the interactions\nbetween the mission operations team and the user.\n\nThe functional requirements derived from the\nmission objectives can be grouped according to the\nsegments.\n\nFunctional Requirements of the Space Segment\n\nThe functional requirements of the space segment\nare subdivided into the functional requirements of\nthe payload and the payload platform, usually the\n\n2/24/09 2:50:12 PM\n",

An example of the for-\nmulation of the functional requirements of a payload\n\u2018or Earth observation is given in Table 8.2. Besides the\nrequirements in the table, other requirements for op-\ntical payloads may also have to be taken into account,\nike stereo capability, different viewing angles, or the\ninteger relationship between the ground pixel sizes of\ndifferent instruments.\n\nThe first draft of the functional requirements\ndocument for the spacecraft bus results from the\nmission objectives and the user needs. The functional\nrequirements for the spacecraft bus can be quantified\nwith regard to the different functional tasks menti-\noned below. The spacecraft bus provides the following\nservices for the payload:\n\ne Transports the payload to the target orbit, perfor-\nms the required orbital maneuvers, and keeps the\npayload in the required orbit or position.\n\ne Keeps the payload mechanically stable and inde-\npendent of internal and external disturbances.\n\ne Points the payload with the necessary accuracy,\nkeeps direction without jitter and avoids prohi-\nbited directions (e.g., pointing a telescope into\nthe Sun).\n\nCHO8.indd 655\n\ne Supplies the payload with electrical power.\n\ne Keeps the temperatures within the allowed\nranges.\n\n\u00a9 Controls the payload so it can collect appropriate\ndata.\n\ne Acquires the housekeeping data of the payload and\ntransmits it to the user.\n\ne Other services, depending on the mission.\n\nFurther functional requirements concerning the pay-\nload and the spacecraft bus are the time and area co-\nverage of the target regions, the payload and spacecraft\nmodes, communication with the ground segment,\nthe data processing algorithms and products of the\npayload data. The functional requirements for the\nspacecraft bus should be expressed quantitatively as\nearly as possible.\n\nOperational Requirements\nThe operational requirements for a mission concept\nconcern the space segment and the ground segment.\nThey result from the mission objectives, the necessa-\nry orbit, the concept for the space segment and the\nmission constraints. An important constraint for the\ndefinition of the operational requirements might\nbe, for instance, the constraint to use only national\nground stations.\nBasic parameters for the definition of operational\nrequirements are:\ne Planned operational life span in orbit: for example,\nthree years.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:13 PM\n",

In\n\ncontrast to the requirements, they are not derived\n\nfrom the mission objectives but result from other\n\neconomic, strategic, political and/or physical consi-\n\nderations. Constraints can be of very different types\n\nand should be distinguished from the requirements.\n\nConstraints can be for instance:\n\ne The given development time for a space mission\n\ne The given operational lifetime\n\ne A fixed cost limit\n\ne A funding model\n\ne Cooperation with national, European or interna-\ntional partners\n\ne The use of particular ground stations\n\ne Compatibility with particular ground stations\n\ne Cooperation with national entities or establish-\nments and use of national technologies\n\ne The space environment during the planned ope-\nrational lifetime in orbit, especially with regard to\nthe 11-year Sun cycle\n\ne Others.\n\nWith the definition of the mission requirements and\nthe constraints, the essential preconditions for the\nmission design are established. The next step is to\ndesign the mission.\n\n8.1.4.5 Basic Mission Concepts and Alternate\nArchitectures\n\nA number of rough mission concepts should be de-\nveloped to meet the requirements and constraints.\nThese rough concepts will reveal differences in the\nmission elements and/or in the interrelationship\nbetween them.

Complexity implies a high variety of elements\nand a variety of connections and relations between\nthem. These elements can in turn be analyzed in\nterms of their constituents to achieve a higher level of\ndetail. In the space sector the hardware terminology\nclassification shown in Table 8.2.1 has been generally\naccepted.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:13 PM\n",

It may be divided\ninto segments (space segment, ground\n\nsegment, etc.)\n\nElement A complete functional system part\nconsisting of subsystems. Examples.\nare an instrument, a satellite bus, a\n\nlauncher, a ground system, etc.\n\nSubsystem A unit of components and parts\nwhich form a functional subsystem,\nfor example the structure and\nmechanisms, the thermal control\nsystem, propulsion, the attitude\n\nregulation system, etc.\n\nEquipment A complete functional unit, for\nexample a battery, reaction wheels, a\n\nreceiver, an antenna, etc.\n\nPart Circuits, screws, cables, materials,\n\nhousings, etc.\n\nThe term system has several uses in the space sec-\ntor. The connection of all subsystems, for example,\nforms the satellite bus. The action of connecting the\npayload module to the satellite bus is called \u201csystem\nintegration\u201d and it forms the system segment named\n\u201csatellite.\u201d Several satellites which interact in space to\ncomplete a mission form a satellite system. This can\nalso be described as the space segment of the mis-\nsion. If there is interaction between different ground\nelements of a space flight mission the combination is\ntermed a ground system. The integrated stages of a\nlauncher form the space transportation system. So\nthe term system is also used for segments as well.\n\n8.2.1.2 The Design Process\n\nThe system design process for a space mission starts\nwith an analysis of the requirements and constraints\n\nand a preliminary design of the system consisting of\n\nthe mission elements. In the following step the ele-\nments are designed, and subsequently the subsystems\nand components. System design can be described as a\n\u201cspiral\u201d process with an increasing level of detail as it\nprogresses. In the development process an inversion\noccurs in order to review and evaluate the designed\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nsolution against the requirements and parameters.\n\nThis process is termed system analysis.\n\nIn the design process the following principles of\nsystem design should be noted:\n\ne Top-Down Design: The design of a space system\nstarts at the system level and proceeds onward to\nthe elements, the elements\u2019 subsystems, the com-\nponents, down to the level of parts, step by step,\nover the different project phases. The system has\nto be defined in its environment, and all interfaces\nmust be specified at each system level.\n\ne Alternative Thinking: At each system level differ-\nent concepts and versions should be designed and\nevaluated in order to find the optimum solution\nto meet the requirements and constraints.\n\ne Scheduling in Phases: Similar to structuring the\ncontents (top down), the design process of a space\nsystem is chronologically structured in different\nphases, with the level of detail increasing step by\nstep. The scheduled phase structure is adapted to\nthe system life-cycle phases.\n\ne System Design According to a Fixed Procedure:\nA system design process is executed according to\na determined basic scheme. The main steps are:\nmission idea, situation analysis (demand, require-\nments, constraints), objectives, design of mission\nelements, analysis and evaluation of the different\nversions, decisions, specification of the mission\nconcepts. The basic scheme of a design at system\nlevel is described in Section 8.1.\n\nIn general there are sequential tasks in a system design\nprocess, which are completed with a formal review\nprocedure. In accordance with [8.2.1] the following\ntasks are defined:\n\n1. The Mission/Functional Activities: These involve\nspecification of the required mission and the func-\ntions. The formal end of the task is formed by the\npreliminary requirements review (PRR), which\nidentifies the objectives of the mission and its fea-\nsibility. The associated system configuration is the\nso-called functional baseline configuration. The\nsystem solution can still be designed in different\nversions.\n\n2. The Requirements Activities: Starting from the\nmission objectives, the requirements for the mis-\nsion, the systems and elements as well as the\n\n2/24/09 2:50:14 PM\n",
    "680": "8.2 Systems Design and Integration\n\ninterfaces are defined and evaluated. The require-\nments are approved in a formal system require-\nments review (SRR). According to the approved\nrequirements the system can be defined and speci-\nfied on a top level. This task is concluded with the\npreliminary design review (PDR). The system\nconfiguration on this level is the so-called develop-\nment configuration baseline of the system. This\nstage is called the \u201cspecified state.\u201d\n\nThe Definition and Justification Activities:\nThese begin after the system requirements re-\nview. On the basis of a clear set of requirements,\nthe system specification, the definition and ex-\nplicit identification of the system are initiated\nby means of data, drawings and other technical\ndocumentation. They are the preconditions for\nthe development, assembly, integration, opera-\ntion and, if necessary, the maintenance of the\nsystem or element. The documentation for the\nexplicit definition of the system (e.g., a satellite)\nis analyzed and examined in the preliminary\ndesign review (PDR). Afterwards, the technical\ndocumentation is refined and elaborated down\nto the level of equipment in an increasing level of\ndetail. The system design is justified by detailed\nanalyses, comparisons, evaluations, documenta-\ntion or design reports and is terminated with the\ncritical design review (CDR). The system is now\nready for production (production configuration\nbaseline) and this state is called the \u201cdefined\nstate.\u201d\n\nThe Verification Activities: After the definition\nof the development configuration baseline (see\ntask 2 above), the terms of assembly, test and\nqualification as well as the resources and meth-\nods of manufacturing, integration and verifi-\ncation of the system and elements are defined.\nThe verification activities include analysis, test\nof development models, and qualification. The\nqualification process includes the theoretical and\nexperimental verification that the defined system\nor element complies with the requirements and\nthat it can be produced. The qualification also in-\ncludes the resources and the process of production.\nThe formal kick-off is the start of test activities at\nthe system level: the test readiness review (TRR).\nThe formal end of these activities is marked by\n\nCHO8.indd 659\n\n659\n\nthe qualification review (QR), which leads to the\n\u201cqualified state\u201d of the system or element.\n\n5. The Production Activities: The assembly and\nmanufacturing activities start after the critical\ndesign review. Production covers all activities of\nassembly, integration and verification of the sys-\ntem. The product state and the test results of each\nmodel are documented in the system acceptance\nreview (AR). The customer confirms that the\nmodel of the system complies with the defined\nbaseline configuration. This stage is called the\n\u201caccepted state.\u201d The acceptance review can also\nbe carried out as a preshipment review (PSR) or\nflight readiness review (FRR).\n\n6. The Utilization Activities: These relate to various\nuser activities and correspond to the routine op-\nerational phase of the space system. These activities\ncan start immediately after the launch of the satel-\nlite or with a delay until after the so-called commis-\nsioning phase. The formal beginning of this activity\ncan be defined as being identical to the operational\nreadiness review (ORR) or flight readiness review,\nor with the launch readiness review (LRR), which\nevaluates all activities related to the launch. The\nformal start of utilization activities can be defined\nas the beginning of operational activities. After\nliftoff and separation of the space element, the com-\nmissioning in space, the flight qualification and\nacceptance tests, and the measurement and evalu-\nation of the performance parameters and the\nachieved flight level take place. This phase of put-\nting the system into operation, called the commis-\nsioning phase, is formally closed with the flight\nqualification review (FQR). Thereafter, the system\ncan go into routine operation and routine utiliza-\ntion activities of the system can start.\n\n7. The Disposal Activities: These activities include\nall procedures from the end-of-life status to final\ndisposal, for example by a targeted reentry into\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere or by disposal in a graveyard\norbit. This phase is prepared during the utilization\nphase and is specific for each system.\n\nThe coherence between these mentioned reviews in a\nspace project and typical project phases is shown in\nFigure 8.2.1.

Generally two types of design\nphilosophies can be distinguished:\n\ne Design to objectives\n\ne Design to budget.\n\nThe design of a space system is carried out according\nto one of these two philosophies. This means that\neither the system is primary designed to achieve the\nscientific, commercial, governmental or other objec-\ntives, or the primary requirement of the system design\nis compliance with a given fixed budget.\n\nDesign to Objectives\n\nThe design philosophy of design to objectives can also\nbe called design to science in the case of science mis-\nsions. A design-to-science project focuses on comple-\ntion of the mission objectives without any exceptions\nand cutbacks. The conception of all elements and\nsegments of the space flight mission is justified by the\nachievement of the scientific, operational, commercial\nor military tasks. Completion of the defined mission\nobjectives and tasks takes priority over the observance\n\nof a cost limit. This does not mean that costs are not\ntaken into account, but that cost planning results from\nthe objectives and the planned implementation of a\nwell-founded mission concept. The cost plan has to\nbe supplemented with an adequate financing concept.\nIf the planned time and cost budgets exceed the limits\nduring mission development and accomplishment,\nopportunities for an increase in the budget as well as\npersonnel and technical resources can be examined\nand exploited. Cutbacks or a decrease in the level of\ncompletion of the mission objectives is practically\nunacceptable.\n\nThe design process according to the design-to-\nscience philosophy is shown in Figure 8.2.2 using\nthe example of a small satellite mission. The mis-\nsion objectives and constraints evolve from the\nidea for accomplishing the mission. The budget is a\ntypical constraint which must be considered when\nthe different mission options are evaluated, but the\nultimate design process is defined by the objectives\nand the functional and operational requirements of\nthe mission.

In the given example\nthe choice of orbit and the need for a satellite constel-\nlation result only from the functional requirements.\nThe costs which result from the orbit selection are\nof secondary importance. The space segment, which\nmeans the satellites and their payloads, is defined by\nthe functional requirements and the optimum orbit\nor trajectory. The operational requirements define\nthe mission operations concept. The costs which\nresult from the mission operations come second\nin this case too. The communication architecture,\nthe ground station concept and mission control\nresult from the mission operations concept. This\nprocess defines how many times the satellite has to\nbe contacted and how many times it has to dispose\nof its data or has to be loaded with new command\nsequences, and at what intervals it has to be moni-\ntored and controlled.\n\nCHO8.indd 661\n\nDesign to Budget\nThe design-to-budget or design-to-cost philoso-\nphy makes compliance with the budget limit the\narbitrative criteria for the design, development and\nmission performance.

The design of the\nelements and segments of the space mission is focused\non fulfilling the scientific, operational, commercial or\nmilitary tasks and objectives, but only to the extent that\nthe budget is not exceeded. If a mission is not feasible\nwithin the existing budget, the objectives have to be\nreviewed by identifying the design drivers, then iterated\nand modified or reduced, if necessary. If neither option\nis feasible, the mission cannot be accomplished.\n\nThe approved budget determines the design of\nall elements and segments of the mission right from\nthe beginning of the project.

The design of the mission elements\nis exclusively defined by the cost budget. For that\nreason the operations concept cannot be primarily\ndesigned according to the operational requirements.\nThis can lead to providing only limited support in the\nground segment, for example. Costs play a decisive\nrole in the definition of the launcher, since it is usually\none of the cost drivers of the mission. For the first time\nquestions arise about the launch strategy: Can there be\na dedicated launch to the desired orbit, or is there an\nopportunity for a satisfactory compromise with other\nmissions by arranging for a \u201cshared launch\u201d in order to\nsplit the launch costs with a partner, or an opportunity\nfor a \u201cpiggyback launch\u201d (meaning that the satellite\ncan be carried as an auxiliary payload)? The answer to\nthese questions defines in the first instance the orbit\nand the space segment. After this decision, the design\nof the other elements can be derived.\n\n8.2.2 System Integration\n\n8.2.2.1 The System Integration Process\n\nSystem integration is the process of assembling and\nintegrating the subsystems and equipment. This results\nin the completion of the space system, which is one of\nthe system segments. Usually, the process of integrat-\ning the satellite bus with the payload is called system\nintegration. Highly integrated systems are, however,\nnot connected with an already completed satellite bus;\ninstead, the satellite bus is constructed around the\npayloads. Therefore, system integration also means\nthe assembly and integration of all subsystems of the\nbus and payloads. The system integration process is\nindividually tailored to each satellite. For this reason\nthere is no generally valid definition of the process.\n\nTypical features of the system integration process\nare:\n\n2/24/09 2:50:16 PM\n",
    "684": "8.2 Systems Design and Integration\n\ne Allsubsystem and payload development has been\ncompleted. All components, materials, tools and\ndevices which are necessary for system integration\nare available, or their delivery is definitely assured\nin time for integration.\n\ne System integration requires auxiliary facilities for\nhandling, assembly and tests. This equipment has\nbeen developed separately and is available in time.\n\ne System integration takes place in an integration\nroom with restricted access.\n\ne The steps of system integration and the necessary\ntests for system verification are specified in an\noperations chart.\n\ne The integration process is divided into stages which\nare completed with a review and test of system\nstatus. This process is called system verification.\nThe power subsystem, for example, is verified after\nthe integration process. All components and their\nconnections with the computers are tested after\nintegration of the on-board computers.\n\ne All steps are documented in an accompanying\ndocument.\n\nIn the definition of the integration sequence two\naspects have to be considered:\n\ne The function\n\ne The access.\n\nThis leads to a commonly accepted sequence: the me-\nchanical baseline structure is built by using the me-\nchanical ground support equipment. Depending on the\naccessibility, components of the thermal control system\nare also integrated (heat conductors, radiators, etc.). In\nthe case of a satellite with a propulsion system, the main\ncomponents of the propulsion system are integrated\n(engine, nozzle, tanks, valves, pipes and other equip-\nment). Then the wiring and, depending on accessibility,\nfurther components are integrated. Because of its func-\ntion, the first electrical system to be integrated should\nbe the power system. In the next step the on-board\ncomputer is integrated, followed by the attitude control\nsystem and the communication system. Depending on\naccess, the payloads are integrated. In the case of integra-\ntion of an optical payload, the payload can be verified\nafter integration by optical ground support equipment\n(OGSE). As mentioned above, the integration process is\nan individualized sequence and can vary from satellite\nto satellite. In any case, ground support equipment is\nnecessary for system integration and test.\n\nCHO8.indd 663\n\n663\n\n8.2.2.2 Integration and Test Facilities\n\nSystem integration takes place in an integration room\nwith well-defined environmental conditions. Such con-\nditions concern, for example, the temperature range,\nrelative humidity, vibrations, EMC, etc. A measure for\nthe dust or particle density in the air is the clean-room\nclassification. The clean-room class specifies the num-\nber of dust particles with a diameter > 0.5 jum per cubic\nfoot of air. Whether a clean room is necessary or not\nhas to be decided from case to case. A clean room is a\nlaboratory room where contamination is controlled. It\nis not necessary for small satellite projects not requiring\nany special work on optical surfaces, open electrical\nintegrated circuits or optical sensors. In this case, adher-\nence to typical laboratory conditions is sufficient:\ne Temperature: 20 + 5 \u00b0C\ne Relative humidity: 50%\ne Dust particles in typical downtown concentra-\ntions, particles < 5 4m (smoke, ash, dust) are\nfloating in the air.\n\nA typical value for the clean-room class where techni-\n\ncal equipment provides air cleanliness is 100 000. For\n\nsatellite integration clean rooms, values of 10 000 can\n\nbe required. For satellites designed and developed by\n\nuniversities a clean-room class of 200 000 is sufficient.\n\nThis is in accordance with clean standard laboratory\n\nrooms without technical air cleaning equipment.\nFor test support during and after system integra-\n\ntion, access to the following support equipment and\n\nfacilities is required:\n\ne Measuring facility for analysis of mass proper-\nties\n\ne Vibration test facility\n\ne Acoustic test chamber (if necessary)\n\ne Thermal chamber\n\ne Vacuum chamber (or thermal vacuum chamber)\n\ne EMC test facilities (if necessary)\n\ne Magnetic field measuring facility (if necessary)\n\ne Attitude control test facility (if necessary)\n\ne Ground station for compatibility tests.\n\n8.2.2.3 Ground Support Equipment\n\nFor the integration process, ground support equip-\nment is necessary to transport the space system, to en-\nable access from all sides, for the wiring, for electrical\nstimulation and testing, and for optical stimulation\n\n2/24/09 2:50:17 PM\n",
    "685": "CHO8.indd 664\n\n664\n\nand testing, if necessary. The required ground support\n\nfacilities at system level are:\n\ne Mechanical Ground Support Equipment\n(MGSE): The MGSE lifts, holds, turns and trans-\nports the system during the integration process. It\nenables access to the system from any direction.\nThe MGSE has to be verified for these applica-\ntions. It consists of different parts, for example a\nsystem support unit, a crane, a forklift, a fueling\nunit, etc.\n\ne Transport Container: The transport container\nis special mechanical support equipment for the\nsafe transport of the space system from the inte-\ngration facility to the launch site or test facilities,\nas required. It is a hermetically closed container\nwith attachments for the space system, vibration\ndampers, shock absorbers, shock recorders and\nhumidity absorbers. After closing it should be able\nto be flushed with nitrogen.\n\ne Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE):\nThe EGSE is a test facility for electromechanical\nand electrical components, equipment and sub-\nsystems of the space system. It applies a voltage\nto the components and parts and enables the\ngeneration of test signals, receives data from the\ntested system, records the data and displays the test\nresults immediately. It is used for complete electri-\ncal verification and allows the complete checkout\nof the space system, whether a transponder, an\ninstrument or a satellite. The EGSE is connected\nwith wires and electrical interfaces to the space\nsystem. A satellite EGSE should be capable of\ncommunicating wirelessly with the satellite via\nthe defined radiofrequency link.\n\ne Optical Ground Support Equipment (OGSE):\nThe OGSE stimulates optical instruments, re-\ncords the response data and shows the results in\na laboratory or at the launch site. The laboratory\nOGSE serves as a measurement facility for re-\ncording the geometric, radiometric and spectral\ncalibration data of the optical instruments. From\ncase to case it can also be designed to measure\nadditional parameters, for example polarization\nsensitivity, stray light suppression, etc. The use\nof robust and mobile OGSE can also be required\nat the launching site to measure and test possible\nchanges in the instrument characteristics caused\nby transport.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\n8.2.3 System Verification\n\nAs mentioned in Section 8.2.2, the system integration\nprocess is associated very closely with system verifica-\ntion. Integration is completed with the completion of\nverification.\n\n8.2.3.1 The Objectives of Verification\n\nVerification is the proof that the space system meets\nthe requirements and is in accord with the required\nproject life cycle [8.2.2]. The contractor is responsible\nfor verification.\n\nAccording to [8.2.2], the objectives of verification\nconsist of qualification of the design, confirmation\nand proof that the product complies with the quali-\nfied design and is without manufacturing failures,\nconfirmation that the space system and the mission\noperation staff (including tools, procedures, resources,\netc.) are able to comply with the mission objectives\nand requirements, and proof of the performance\nparameters of the space system.\n\n8.2.3.2 Stages of the Verification Process\n\nThe verification process is accomplished in different\nsequential phases according to the life cycle of a space\nmission project. The different verification phases ac-\ncording to ECSS-E-10-02A (1998) [8.2.2] are:\n\ne Qualification: The objective consists of demon-\nstrating that the designed system meets all the\nrequirements, including margins. The qualifica-\ntion object must comply completely with the\n\u201cfull flight design\u201d and the \u201cflight standard\u201d (e.g.,\nQM, FM and PEM). The proof results from tes-\nting the mentioned models with test stimulations\nthat are much more intensive than the acceptance\nstimulations.\n\ne Acceptance: The objective of this stage consists of\ndemonstrating that the product has no manufac-\nturing and integration defects and that operational\nuse is appropriate. The proof results from testing\nwith stimulations which are a little more intensive\nthan the expected excitations.\n\ne  Prelaunch Verification: The objective of the pre-\nlaunch verification stage consists of proving that\nthe space system is ready for launch and early space\n\n2/24/09 2:50:18 PM\n",

Verification results from the outcome\nof tests and analysis.\n\ne In-Orbit Verification: The objective of the \u201cin-\norbit\u201d verification phase consists of confirming\nthat the space system is qualified for the defined\napplication in space. The evidence results from\nin-orbit tests, supplemented by ground tests.\n\ne Postlanding Verification: The objective of the\npostlanding verification phase consists of verifying\ncertain functions and system status after the mis-\nsion. This is only valid for reentry systems.\n\n8.2.3.3 Verification Methods\n\nVerification is achieved by one or more of the follow-\n\ning four methods [8.2.2].\n\nTest: This is a method to verify the requirements by\nmeasuring product properties or functions under certain\nsimulated conditions. A test can also include the dem-\nonstration of operational properties and requirements.\nThe following kinds of tests can be distinguished:\n\ne Development test for the analysis of new develop-\nments and demonstration of the suitability of new\ndesign concepts.\n\n\u00a9 Qualification test for the demonstration and evi-\ndence of flight acceptability of the designed system\nunder the required launch and space conditions. A\nmodel in flight standard is tested with higher than\nexpected stimulations and impact durations.\n\ne Acceptance test to prove that the flight model com-\nplies with all requirements and is free of manufactur-\ning defects. The stimulations are similar to the ex-\npected loads, but the impact durations are shorter.\n\ne Analysis validation test for the acquisition of data\nunder a strictly defined test environment to vali-\ndate or improve mathematical models by testing\nthem in the flight standard with low stimulations\nand short impact durations.\n\nAnalysis: This is a method of theoretical or empi-\nrical verification by evaluating properties using com-\nmonly accepted techniques. These analysis techniques\nare systematic, statistical and qualitative methods of\nanalysis as well as simulation tests or verification by\nsimilarity of space systems.\n\nDesign Review: This method is characterized by\nusing validating data, design documents, technical\n\nCHO8.indd 665\n\n665\n\nspecifications and other plans for verification. This\ndocumentation must show that the design complies\nwith the requirements.\n\nVerification by Inspection: This is a verification\nmethod that confirms the conformance of the hard-\nware and software with the relevant documentation\n(test reports, protocols). It provides visible evidence of\nthe physical properties and condition of the object be-\ning verified, without the use of special laboratories.\n\n8.2.3.4 Verification levels\n\nVerification takes place at all levels with space mission\nhardware in accordance with Table 8.2.1.\n\n8.2.3.5 Models for Verification\n\nVerification of a space system is performed by using\ndifferent models. The number of models is optimized\nwith regard to the costs, risk and complexity of the\nverification.\n\nMock-up (MU): An MU is a model for the opti-\nmization and control of interfaces, for validating the\nintegration process, for the accommodation analysis,\nthe architecture analysis, human factor evaluation and\nthe evaluation of operational procedures. It represents\nthe geometric configuration, layout and interfaces.\nIt is used above all for human factor evaluation and\nastronaut training, and similar tests.\n\nDevelopment Model (DM): A DM is a model\nsupporting the development process and used to\nvalidate the feasibility of the design. It represents\nonly the selected functions to be tested, for example\nmechanical, electrical or thermal functions. Size, shape\nand interfaces do not need to be representative, if they\nare not the test object. The DM is used for develop-\nment tests at any verification level, especially at the\nequipment level.\n\nTable 8.2.1: System levels and verification methods.\n\nVerification method\n\nSystem level\n\nPart Review, inspection\nEquipment Review, inspection, test\nSubsystem Analysis, test, inspection\nElement Analysis, test, inspection\nSystem Analysis, test, inspection\n\n2/24/09 2:50:18 PM\n",

It\nrepresents the full functionality of the hardware and\nsoftware. It is realized with commercial parts. Missing\ncomponents are simulated. It is also called the \u201celectri-\ncal model\u201d and can be used at any verification level.\n\n\u201cSuitcase\u201d Model: This is a model for the complete\nsimulation of the communication system in compatibility\ntests with the designated ground stations. This includes\ninterface tests and failure mode analysis. It represents the\ncomplete functionality of all radiofrequency equipment\nin the communication system (transmitter, receiver) of\nthe flight model across all parameters and it contains the\nnecessary functional simulations like decoder, transpon-\nder, etc. The use of commercial off-the-shelf components\nis allowed. It is used for qualification and compatibility\ntests with the ground segment.\n\nStructural Model (SM): This is a model for the\nqualification of the structure and validation of the\nfinite element model of the structure. It represents the\nflight standard regarding the structural parameters. It\nis used for qualification tests.\n\nThermal Model (TM): This model is dedicated\nto the qualification of the thermal design and to\nthe validation of the thermal mathematical model.\nIt represents the flight standard regarding thermal\nparameters and properties.

It is used for qualification tests\nat system level.\n\nEngineering Model (EM): The EM is used to qualify\nthe functions, to verify the fail-safe system operations,\nand for testing important parameters. It represents the\nelectrical functions by using commercial components\nand is built in a flight-typical configuration. It repre-\nsents the flight design without redundancy and high-\nreliability parts. It is used at any system level.\n\nQualification Model (QM): This model is used\nfor qualification of the design of a component or sub-\nsystem of a space system. It represents the complete\nflight design and standard. It is used at the component\nand subsystem levels or for qualification tests.\n\nEngineering Qualification Model (EQM): This is\na model for the functional qualification of the design\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nand the interfaces, as well as for the verification of\nelectromagnetic compatibility (EMC). It represents\nthe complete flight design without the high-reliability\ncomponents, which can be substituted by military stan-\ndard (MIL) parts of the same manufacturer. It is used\nat any system level for functional qualification tests.\n\nFlight Model (FM): This is a model for space ap-\nplication. It represents the complete flight design and\nflight standard. A flight model is built at any system\nlevel. It is tested at the acceptance level only.\n\nProtoflight Model (PEM): This is a model for\nspace application and for qualification of the design.\nIt represents the complete flight design and flight\nstandard. It is used at any system level. The PFM\nundergoes qualification tests and can be used for\nspace application after completion of the qualifica-\ntion procedure.\n\nFlight Spare (FS): This model is consistent with\nthe requirements for space applications. It represents\nthe complete flight design and standard. It is used at\nthe component level or the system level for payloads\nand small satellites.\n\nFurther Models: Apart from the models men-\ntioned above, additional models can be developed\nfor the verification process, for example a functional\nmodel to qualify or validate functional and operational\nconcepts, to verify mass properties, or to train staff.\n\n8.2.3.6 Model Philosophy\n\nThe number and kinds of models used for system\nverification depend on the selected philosophy. The\nphilosophy is defined by the mission requirements\nand constraints. Generally the following three model\nphilosophies can be distinguished.\nPrototype Philosophy: This is a model philosophy\ncharacterized by extensive use of different models\nfor system verification (note that it requires many\nprototypes). This approach reduces the technical\nrisk. The philosophy is used in the design and devel-\nopment process of very new and complex systems,\ninterplanetary space flight missions and for special\nrequirements. The main disadvantage is in the high\ntotal costs which result from the manufacture and use\nof many models.\nProtoflight Philosophy: This is characterized\nby the use of only one model, which flies after the\nqualification and acceptance tests.

Environmental testing means to pro-\nvide, to approximately simulate or to directly apply\nthe environmental conditions that occur during\nlaunch or during the mission to the space equipment\nunder test.\n\nThe environmental conditions in this context\ncomprise all natural or artificial environments that\ncan possibly have an effect on the space equipment\u2019s\nlife cycle. The most important but not the only envi-\nronmental effects or environments are:\n\ne Mechanical: Static, dynamic and aerodynamic\nloads, vibrations and shock\n\ne Thermal: Vacuum, internal and external thermal\nsources and sinks\n\ne Electromagnetic: Artificially generated, natural\nand sometimes high-energy processes and mag-\nnetic fields\n\ne Special Environmental Effects and Conditions:\n\nPlasmas, microgravity, impact of micrometeori-\n\ntes, near-Earth or interplanetary space, specific\n\norbit conditions (for instance, the radiation belt\nsurrounding Jupiter).\n\nDue to the complexity and diversity of environmental\nconditions, environmental tests are preferably con-\nducted separately in test programs, even if the condi-\ntions exist in parallel. A combination of environmental\nconditions in a test is not considered an option unless\noperational restraints necessitate this approach, such\nas thermal and mechanical conditions on entry into\nan atmosphere or the operation of an engine during\natmospheric ascent.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nFunctional tests, in contrast, are dedicated to\nproving the reliable behavior of space equipment\nduring its operational life. It is evident that a wide\nvariety of functional tests exist.\n\nIn this section of the book, the focus is on environ-\nmental simulation, sometimes in combination with\nfunctional tests, as required. One of the main reasons\nfor this focus is that environmental simulation tests\nfor space engineering are in general understood and\nimplemented as a standard for development and\nacceptance tests. Moreover, environmental testing\nrequires considerable effort to provide adequate test\nfacilities and capabilities. Accordingly, environmental\ntests for space engineering are performed exclusively\nin very specialized test centers. In this context this sec-\ntion deals with the experimental investigation of the\nphysical and technical properties of space equipment,\nsince these properties are of particular importance\nfor equipment operating under the environmental\nconditions of space. Examples are investigations of\ndynamic properties (rigid body properties and modal\nparameters).\n\nThe objective of environmental tests within the\nscope of development and acceptance testing is to\ndemonstrate beyond doubt and on the ground the\nreliability of space equipment under the anticipated\n(space) environmental conditions. Furthermore, it has\nto be proved that the operational behavior of the space\nequipment can be kept within the specified tolerances\nduring the planned mission period in the specific en-\nvironments. In the following sections, it will be shown\nthat checks and environmental tests are carried out\nnot just at the end of the assembly phase. During the\ncomplete development phase of space equipment,\nenvironmental tests are systematically planned and\nperformed in order to achieve complete proof of\ndesign suitability for space applications.\n\nThe proof of suitability is usually demonstrated in\ntwo stages: qualification and acceptance. These two\nstages differ as to the number of tests involved as well\nas their extent and intensity:\n\u00a9 Qualification Test: Formal experimental verifi-\n\ncation that the realization of the design and the\n\nmanufacturing procedures result in space equip-\nment which meets the requirements or specifica-\ntions.

The anticipated maximum flight\nrequirements can be fulfilled without restriction\nor diminished functional capability.\n\nSeveral standards have emerged for the planning and\n\nperformance of environmental tests for space flight.\n\nThe most important within ESA are ECSS-E-10-03\n\n(Space Engineering \u2014 Testing) and ECSS-E-10-02\n\n(Space Engineering \u2014 Verification), [8.3.1] and [8.3.2]\n\nrespectively. For NASA, the series of standards NASA-\n\nSTD-5000 and 7000 are applicable [8.3.4]. These\n\nstandards are understood to be the baseline for any\n\nverification and test program. However, adaptations\nare possible in principle; that is, they can be tailored\nto new or altered mission requirements, technological\ninnovations or developments. Accordingly, in any spe-\ncific case the test effort may be increased or reduced.\n\nIn order to show the significance of environmental\ntests, in particular with respect to tailoring, a few basic\ninsights and developments are listed here:\n\ne The success of a space program is not simply the\nresult of the strict application of standards. Much\nmore decisive is the testing of the built space\nequipment under appropriate conditions, and a\nguarantee that the verified equipment will be used\nas verified. Simply said: \u201cTest what you fly, fly what\nyou test.\u201d Some failed space programs which were\ndesigned in the era of \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d have\nforcibly brought this lesson home.\n\ne There are, however, a vast number of successful or\nless successful space programs. Within the frame-\nwork of the ESA-funded initiative MAT D [8.3.5],\nan impartial check for failures in many of these\nspace programs led to interesting conclusions as to\nthe effectiveness of specific tests. Reasons to per-\nform or not to perform a specific test in order to\nreduce risks can be derived using statistical means.\nAs more detailed results and conclusions of this\ninitiative are beyond the scope of this handbook,\nreference is made to the literature.\n\ne Besides the purely technical aspects of checks or, in\nparticular, of environmental simulation tests, the\n\nCHO8.indd 669\n\n669\n\nshared production of space equipment requires\nqualification and acceptance tests as a basis for\nthe acceptance of subcontracted work.\n\nIn Section 8.2 the purpose of a verification matrix is\ndiscussed. It forms the basis for a test matrix describ-\ning environmental and functional tests in detail by\nindicating the type of test and specific test require-\nments. Finally, the elaboration of test requirements\nfor a specific test or even a series of tests is laid down\nin a test plan. In this plan, the test objectives, the test\nmethods, the test article configurations, the relevant\n(environmental) conditions or test loads, the test\narticle functions to be investigated, the safety require-\nments to be observed when handling the test article,\nand the physical or electrical parameters of the envi-\nronment or test article to be measured or monitored\nare described in detail. Moreover, the criteria defining\nsuccess or failure of a test are listed. A test procedure is\nprepared following the guidelines for the test plan for\neach individual test; it includes detailed step-by-step\ninstructions on what parameters are to be measured\nwith the test facility, how the test is to be performed\nand when measurements are to be taken.\n\nThe sequence of tests within a test plan usually\nfollows two principles. The first is that the sequence of\nenvironmental conditions and functional operations\nshould reflect actual operational life. The second is\nthat potential failures and problems should be de-\ntected as soon as possible within a test program to\navoid the cost of repeated testing.\n\nIn order to ensure the last aspect, a model phi-\nlosophy is designed for each test program which\nassigns physical test articles to the various tests. The\nobjective of a model philosophy is, as already discussed\nin Section 8.2, to define the optimum assignment of\ntest article properties and the number of test articles\nfor the individual tests. This should be done so that\nhighly efficient and reliable product verification can\nbe achieved in a short time and with reasonable con-\nsideration of costs and risks.\n\n8.3.2 Verification Planning and Cost\nFactors\n\nPlanning the verification and testing procedures for a\nspace project is just as complex a process as the design\n\n2/24/09 2:50:20 PM\n",
    "691": "CHO8.indd 670\n\n670\n\nand implementation of the space equipment itself.\n\nMoreover, this process is highly dependent on deci-\n\nsions made during the preceding phases. This must\n\nby all means be taken into account in overall project\n\nplanning in order to avoid follow-up costs later on\n\ncaused by rescheduling etc. In addition, the following\n\nprinciples are of prime importance in a qualification\n\nand acceptance program:\n\ne Implementation and precise application of\nacknowledged standards\n\ne Comprehensive and complete planning and docu-\nmentation of all measures and activities\n\ne Communication and cooperation on the basis of\nclearly defined responsibilities\n\ne Accurate documentation of inspections, identifica-\ntion of all nonconformances or deficits, initiation\nand follow-up of corrective measures\n\ne Implementation of processes for continuous im-\nprovement of the procedures and methods.\n\nA recommended test sequence which has proven its\n\nworth in practice is shown in Figure 8.3.1.\n\nThe reasons for this test sequence are the fol-\nlowing:\n\n1. The loads on the test object are imposed in the\nsame sequence as they will occur during the\nlaunch of a rocket: first the mechanical loads,\nfollowed by the thermal impact, and concluding\nwith the electromagnetic loads.\n\n2. This test sequence is also based on cost consi-\nderations. During thermal testing, the costs that\narise are significantly higher than those caused by\nmechanical testing. If repairs are necessary based\non the results of the mechanical tests, only these\nhave to be repeated, not the thermal tests, which\nare much more cost intensive.\n\n3. If all mechanical tests are performed in one se-\nquence, the project benefits from synergies that\ninfluence both time and cost. The measurement\nsensors for the testing can be used for all the me-\nchanical tests, making it unnecessary to remove\nthem and newly install them numerous times. This\nwould otherwise have to be done to avoid outgas-\nsing the sensors, glue and cables, which would cause\ncontamination during thermal testing. Also, if the\nthermal balance and thermal vacuum tests are per-\nformed in one sequence, the extremely demanding\ntest preparations do not have to be done twice.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nPhysical properties|\nCorona and arcing\nHumidity 3\nThermal cycling |\nLeak\n1 { Thermal vacuum |\nPressure\nLeak\nAcceleration\nEMC/ESD |\nSinusoidal\nvibration\nMagnetic\nRandom vibration?

For the vibration test, it is very helpful to know\nthe exact mass properties, such as mass and center\nof gravity. Therefore, mass properties should be\ndetermined at the beginning. In practice, however,\nthis determination is also often used in order to\noptimize the whole test campaign, for example to\nbridge waiting periods related to the availability\nof test facilities.\n\n5. Magnetic measurements should be performed at\nthe end of the test campaign in order to avoid a\nchange in magnetic characteristics caused by any\nsubsequent tests. It could be, for example, that the\nmagnetic characteristics of a test object change\nafter the vibration test because the electrodynamic\nvibration test facilities create large magnetic fields\nduring testing.\n\nIt is quite clear that a well-planned test campaign\nis crucial for the success of the project as it ensures\nthe functionality and thus the success of the mission,\nadherence to the schedule and to the budget.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:20 PM\n",

Environmental Tests and Basic Concepts\n\n8.3.3 Mechanical Tests\n\nEach piece of space equipment is subjected to various\nmechanical stresses, mainly at the beginning of a mis-\nsion (launch phase). But sometimes also during a mis-\nsion, for example during trajectory and attitude control\nmaneuvers, separation processes, atmospheric entry\nand landing, mechanical stress has to be considered.\n\nDuring launch, apart from static loads due to the\nlauncher\u2019s acceleration and the aerodynamic loads,\nvibrations are generated by the propulsion system\nand the atmospheric environment (wind gusts, vorti-\nces). In addition, the high acoustic noise level during\nlaunch (e.g., ground reflection of the sound pressure)\nand during the transonic flight phase (aerodynamic\neffects) produces fluctuating pressure fields impinging\nthe surface of structures. Similar mechanical loads oc-\ncur during atmospheric reentry, augmented by high\nthermal loads. Moreover, the ignition of propulsion\nsystems, separation and release processes initiated\nby pyrotechnic devices as well as landing maneuvers\nresult in temporary shock loads.\n\nThe suitability of space equipment to withstand\nthese mechanical loads is verified in specific vibration,\nacoustic, shock and static tests at either the qualifica-\ntion or the acceptance stage.\n\nIn addition, for all dynamic processes in the space\nequipment or during a mission (e.g., attitude con-\ntrol, other flight maneuvers), exact knowledge of\nthe relevant structural parameters like resonance\ncharacteristics and mass properties is extremely\nrelevant. These parameters are determined by using\nmathematical models. However, before applying the\nresults, the suitability of the mathematical models has\nto be verified by experiment as well. Modal survey\ntests and measurement of the mass properties are the\nexperimental tools which provide the required infor-\nmation. These investigations are usually performed\non structural models (modal survey) or flight models\n(mass properties determination).\n\nBefore starting a detailed discussion of the me-\nchanical tests, the mechanical loads will be distin-\nguished with respect to their temporal appearance\nand relevance during a mission.\n\nQuasi-static loads mainly occur during launch,\nmaneuvers and atmospheric reentry. They are evoked\nby the propulsion systems, aerodynamic loads and\n\nCHO8.indd 671\n\n671\n\ninertial loads. They change slowly in terms of time and\nresult in relatively low structural responses.\nTransient and shock loads occur when rapid\nchanges of otherwise stationary conditions take place,\nfor instance the thrust build-up or shutdown of pro-\npulsion systems, separation processes and landing.\nThese events may lead to very short-term but extreme-\nly high structural responses (shock responses).\nQuasi-harmonic loads typically occur as a tran-\nsient harmonic excitation, for example due to instabil-\nity of the propulsion system, the temporary excitation\nof structural resonances, or the autoexcitation of\ndynamic systems caused by back coupling (e.g., the\nPOGO effect). These excitations may last several sec-\nonds and may result in significantly high structural\nresponses. In particular for launcher systems, care has\nto be taken to avoid such occurrences since they may\nresult in dynamic instability beyond control.\nRandom loads occur during all aerodynamic and\npropulsion processes. They are introduced into the\nstructure either by body noise or airborne noise. The\nrespective structural responses may be high.\n\n8.3.3.1 Vibration Tests\n\nPurpose\nVibration tests are used to simulate dynamic mechani-\ncal loads.\n\nThe relevant vibrations for space applications\ncover a frequency range from 1 to 2000 Hz and can\nbe characterized in the following manner:\n\ne Transient or quasi-harmonic in the lower\nfrequency range (1 to 100 Hz)\n\ne Randomly distributed, noise-like, in the higher\nfrequency range (20 to 2000 Hz).\n\nDue to the wide frequency range, vibration loads are\ncritical for the main system structures as well as for\nsubsystems and components.\nThe objectives of a vibration test are:\ne Proof that a specimen can withstand the occurring\ndynamic loads.\ne Determination of component level vibration loads\nduring system-level tests.\n\nIn addition, vibration test measurement data can\nbe used up to a certain degree in order to derive the\nmodal properties of a specimen.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:20 PM\n",

If an abort criterion is\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nmet, the vibration test is immediately stopped.

Often, due to the broadband\nrandom excitation, the acoustic noise test is also con-\nsidered as an acceptance test to reveal hidden failures\nin manufacturing.\n\nThe acoustic noise test supplements the vibration\ntest with respect to structural loading in the medium-\nand high-frequency ranges. The fluctuating noise\npressure fields impinge on the test article\u2019s surface and\ncause, in particular on structures with large surface\nareas but low mass density (e.g., antenna reflectors\nand solar array wings), significantly high structural\nresponses in the range of up to 200 to 300gpys- This\nemphasizes the importance of an acoustic test for such\nstructural components.\n\nNoise fields to be used in tests are implicitly re-\nquired to be diffuse and homogeneous. That is, the\nnoise impingement is not directional in the statisti-\ncal sense and the acoustic spectrum can be shaped\nto meet the typical characteristics of an individual\nlauncher. Indeed, for testing, a specific acoustic noise\nspectrum is used for each launcher type. The acoustic\n\n2/24/09 2:50:23 PM\n",
    "696": "8.3. Environmental Tests and Basic Concepts\n\nnoise spectrum is expressed in octave or third-octave\nband sound pressure levels (SPL) in decibels (dB).\nIn Table 8.3.4 a typical octave band acoustic noise\nspectrum is given.\n\nAnother parameter of the acoustic noise field is\nthe overall sound pressure level (OASPL), which is\ndetermined by the octave or third-octave band sound\npressure levels as follows:\n\nOASPL = 10 log \u00a5\u00b0 10 exp [ior (8.3.4)\n\nTypically, the required sound pressure levels for space\nequipment at the qualification stage amount to 143\nto 148 dBo,spy.

The structural responses of the two\nlow-level tests (usually acceleration responses, inter-\nface forces or strain measurements) shown in PSD\ndiagrams are compared and checked for indications\nof structural change possibly indicating failures.

This check is of\nparticular importance, since the acoustic simulation\nmodels for acoustic loads depend on statistical and\nempirical methods whose assumptions have to be\nverified by test.\n\nThe performance of an acoustic noise test using\nhigh acoustic sound pressures requires specific re-\nverberation chambers. Reverberation chambers are\ndesigned with acoustically reflective walls all around,\nthus yielding long reverberation times. Long rever-\nberation times are desired since the required energy\nto produce high acoustic sound pressure levels is\nminimized. The reverberation chambers for space ap-\nplications usually provide volumes between 1100 and\n1600 m?. The physical reason for such a large volume\nis that acoustic energy in reverberant environments\ncan only be established when acoustic modes of the\nchamber, namely standing waves, can be excited.\nAccordingly, the largest chamber dimension defines\nthe longest acoustic wavelength and thus the lowest\nacoustic frequency which can be excited. It is desir-\nable to design a reverberation chamber with a lowest\nacoustic mode around 20 Hz so that the next acoustic\nmodes can provide a sufficiently high acoustic mode\ndensity in the 31.5 Hz and the 63 Hz octave bands.\nProvided that there is a high acoustic mode density,\nsufficient homogeneity of the diffuse acoustic noise\nfield can be achieved because it is actually built up by\nthe superposition of numerous acoustic modes.\n\nThe acoustic energy is mainly produced by using\npneumatic transducers. Their working principle is to\nfeed pressurized gas (air or nitrogen) through electro-\ndynamically driven grids which act like a valve. Quick\nopening and shutting of the grids by using appropriate\nrandom drive signals causes pressure fluctuations of\nthe airstreams which, once conducted to the rever-\nberation chamber via exponential horns, provide the\nrequired acoustic excitation of the chamber.\n\nIn order to control the acoustic noise spectrum, the\nnoise field of the reverberation chamber is measured\nwith a number of microphones (usually 4-12, depend-\ning on the application). The averaged acoustic pres-\nsure spectrum is compared to the specified spectrum\nand the driving spectrum for the pneumatic transduc-\ners can be adjusted accordingly. In large reverberation\n\n2/24/09 2:50:23 PM\n",
    "697": "CHO8.indd 676\n\n676\n\nchambers, realistic maximum overall sound pressure\nlevels amount to 153 to 160 dBoaspy. If higher acoustic\nsound pressures are required, use has to be made of\nsmaller reverberation chambers or progressive wave\ntubes with much smaller acoustic volumes. In a pro-\ngressive wave tube, the acoustic noise field generates\na progressively grazing noise impingement.\n\n8.3.3.3 Shock\n\nPurpose\nShock tests are used to simulate short-term, mostly\ntransient, mechanical loads. Shock loads are generated\nduring a launcher start by ignition of the propellant\nsystems and especially by the pyrotechnical activation\nof release mechanisms (e.g., stage separation, fairing\nseparation or satellite release). This type of mechani-\ncal load is characterized by high accelerations (up to\n100000 m/s?) and very short impact durations (10-\n20ms). Therefore, it is more relevant for electronic,\nfine mechanical or optical components than for the\nmain system structures.\nThe objectives of a shock test are:\ne Proof that a specimen can withstand the occurring\nshock loads.\ne Determination of component-level shock loads\nduring system-level tests.\n\nTest Specification, Theory\n\nShock loads can be specified by the corresponding ac-\nceleration time history or by using the shock response\nspectrum (SRS) in the frequency domain.\n\nFigure 8.3.6 shows the typical acceleration time\nhistory of a pyrotechnically activated shock for space\napplications.\n\nThis transient, random excitation can hardly be\ndescribed in a time history format. Therefore, the\n\nFigure 8.3.6: Pyroshock time history.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nfrequency domain description as a shock response\nspectrum is most commonly used.\n\nA shock response spectrum defines the maximum\nacceleration responses on an infinite number of dy-\nnamic single degree-of-freedom systems caused by a\nshock event (Figure 8.3.7).\n\nFor the relevant damping a value of 5% (Q= 10)\nis generally applied.\n\nThe typical pyroshock spectrum is characterized\nby a slope of 9-12 dB/octave followed by a constant\nlevel, as shown in Figure 8.3.8.\n\nShock test parameters and levels for space applica-\ntions can be found in the handbooks of the relevant\nlauncher systems. They are derived from measure-\nments or by the use of coupled load analysis.\n\nThe required parameters for a shock test specifica-\ntion are summarized in Table 8.3.5.\n\nOccasionally, test specifications with impulse-type\nshock loads (e.g., half-sine shocks) can be found.\nHowever, these are not suitable for simulating a tran-\nsient-type shock event.\n\nTest Facilities, Test Procedures\n\nThe simulation of shock loads for space applications\nis performed with either pyrotechnical or mechanical\nexcitation.\n\nFor pyrotechnical excitation the actual pyro-\nmechanisms like the satellite clamp bands are used.\nIn addition, standardized pyroshock setups (so-called\nshock generating units (SHOGUNs)) have been\ndeveloped. A typical example of this approach is the\n\u201cSHOGUN-Test\u201d offered by Arianespace for the Ari-\nane 5 shock load verification of satellites.\n\nAmaxt Amax2 Amaxn\n\nFigure 8.3.7: SRS definition.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:24 PM\n",

The relevant frequency range\nfor space applications expands up to 60 Hz or 150 Hz,\ndepending on the application. The modal parameters\nare regularly used to verify the structural models and\nto update them, if required.\n\nModal tests are performed on space equipment\nif verified mathematical models are required for\ncoupled load analysis for the launch configuration,\nfor launcher guidance or when very specific dynamic\nconditions have to be met (e.g., if the lowest eigenfre-\nquencies with high effective mass of a payload have to\nbe higher than a certain defined frequency). Represen-\ntative example projects for which modal survey tests\nhad to be performed comprise all major components\nof the Ariane 5 launcher, the Space Shuttle and all\nSpace Shuttle payloads, as well as payloads with high\neffective mass.\n\nFor a modal survey, the equation of motion for a\ndiscrete mass system is considered:\n\nMi+F,+Kx=p (8.3.5)\n\nMand K represent the mass and the stiffness matrix,\nrespectively, x the vector of the displacement degrees\nof freedom (during the modal test practically the\nmeasured structural responses) and p the vector\nof the external excitation. The damping forces Fp\nare described either with the simple linear viscous\napproach Fy = Dx or by using the approach for\nstructural damping Fp = iDx. Both damping models\ndescribe only approximately the real damping behav-\nior since real damping processes do not follow linear\nmodels in general and often several physical damping\nmechanisms act in parallel. Therefore, it is sufficient\nto assume the simplest case of structural damping in\nthe following equations.\n\nBasically two different techniques exist to deter-\nmine the modal parameters, namely the phase reso-\nnance and the phase separation technique.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nPhase Resonance Technique: At selected points\nseveral exciters are attached to the structure so that\nthe individual eigenmodes can be excited directly\nand isolated from all other modes. Then the modal\nparameters of such an isolated mode are directly ac-\ncessible by measurement. This technique, also called\nthe ground vibration test (GVT), uses harmonic\nexcitation to vibrate the structure under test while\nkeeping the phase of all excitation forces real (i.e., the\nphase angle is 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0). The harmonic excitation\nfrequency and the distribution of the forces (in ampli-\ntude and phase or antiphase, respectively) are adjusted\nsuch that the structure\u2019s response is in resonance; that\nis, the structural responses are in quadrature with the\nexcitation forces. For a real excitation force pattern this\nmeans that the real parts of the structural responses\nare zero and the imaginary parts of the responses are\nat a (local) maximum.\n\nUnder this tuned condition, the equation of motion\ncan be resolved into an imaginary and a real part:\n\n[-\u00ab?M+K]-x\"-D-x\u2122=p (8.3.6)\n\n[-o?M+K]-x+D-x\"=0\n\nThe result is the fundamental physical condition that\nthe excitation forces are balancing the structure\u2019s\ndamping forces and the isolated eigenmode is vibrat-\ning in its undamped frequency:\n\n-D- x\u2122=p; x*=0 (8.3.7)\n\n[-0\" M+K]-x\u2122=0\n\nHence, in the tuned condition, the eigenfrequency\n@, and the respective normal mode \u00a5, = x(@,) are\ndirectly accessible to the measurement. The structural\ndamping parameter g, is determined by analyzing\nresponse functions around resonance measured by\nvarying the excitation frequency while maintaining\nthe tuned force pattern. Finally, the modal mass m,\nis determined by the energy input, that is the scalar\nproduct of excitation forces and the acceleration re-\nsponses at the excitation points, by means of a simple\nalgebraic equation and using a suitable normalization\nfactor n,:\n\n2/24/09 2:50:29 PM\n",

As a consequence, selecting the most appropriate\nprocedure to determine the modal parameters cannot\njust be a matter of inherent cost and time aspects; the\naccuracy requirements for the test results still play an\nimportant role and have to be considered in terms of\nthe purpose that the modal results have to fulfill.

However, for exact model verifica-\ntion and updating a mathematical dynamic model,\na dedicated modal survey test is required. The clas-\nsical ground vibration test using phase resonance\ntechniques will always provide more accurate results\nthan multipoint random frequency response measure-\nments with a subsequent modal analysis.\n\nThe physical and procedural reasons which speak\nin favor of using the high-quality standard of ground\nvibration test results are as follows:\n\ne During a ground vibration test all measurements\nand conditions are accessible in a clear manner\nand the modal parameters can be determined\ndirectly (excitation forces, behavior of interfaces\nand restraint conditions, check of the structure\nfor linear behavior, direct observation, or even\nmodeling the correction of nonlinear effects in\nthe measurements).\n\ne The modal parameters are determined in a steady-\nstate vibration condition.\n\ne Quality checks on the modal parameters may be\nperformed, and immediate correlation with the\nanalytical test prediction is feasible at any time\nduring the test process. This enables pinpointing\nof any inconsistency and doubt which may arise\nduring the experimental investigation.\n\ne The accuracy of the main modes can be\ndetermined to high precision on the basis of a\ncomprehensive and consistent data basis.\n\nCompared to this list, modal analysis of vibration\n\ntest data has the following disadvantages:\n\ne Some of the test parameters are not exactly, or only\nwith difficulty, or not at all accessible to a modal\nanalysis. This involves, for instance, the speed of\nthe swept sine excitation, which does not allow for\na complete build-up of a steady-state modal vibra-\ntion, or for potential interaction of the vibration\ntable and the closed loop vibration control system\nwith the dynamic characteristics of the test article.\nThese effects can only partially be accounted for by\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nmathematical or empirical corrections. In certain\ncircumstances, namely a test article with high\nmass, even the mathematical model of the vibra-\ntion table has to be considered when comparing\ntest results and model prediction.\n\ne The excitation forces acting between the vibra-\ntion table and the test article are not accessible to\nmeasurement, unless a dedicated interface force\nmeasurement device is used. If these forces are\nnot measured, the modal analysis cannot provide\nthe modal mass or the effective masses based on\nthe experimental data. These modal parameters\ncan only be estimated by making reference to the\nanalytical mass matrix of the test article.\n\ne Even if the interface forces and moments between\nthe vibration table and test article are measured,\nthe resulting frequency response functions de-\nscribe the dynamic behavior of the vibrating\nsystem in free-free boundary conditions. The\nmathematical transformation into a restrained\nsystem requires additional assumptions.\n\ne The methodically proper resolution of closely\nspaced modes is excluded since the required or-\nthogonal excitation patterns are missing.\n\ne The estimation of the modal parameter\u2019s accuracy\nis quite difficult and may even lead to unreasonably\nhigh and not useful error bounds.\n\nNevertheless, the modal analysis of vibration test data\nhas emerged as a practicable and inexpensive tool to\nprovide an overview of the modal characteristics,\ntaking into account that the resulting accuracy is\nnot as high as that obtained from a dedicated modal\nsurvey test. Accordingly, the improvement of this\nmodal analysis approach is still a subject for scientific\nresearch.\n\nModal test results are correlated with the respective\nanalytical models by using the orthogonality relations\nof eigenmodes:\n\n0 for s #1\nm, (real) for s=1\n\nA, = we My, -{ (8.3.10)\n\nThe close interaction of test results and analytical\nresults requires the dedicated analytical preparation of\na modal survey test.

This machine\nallows the test article to be moved along the vertical\nbar of the machine and the test article to be rotated\naround its vertical and lateral axes.\n\nThe generalized torsion pendulum machine also\nincorporates center of gravity scales.

Due to space vacuum, heat ex-\nchange is mainly determined by radiation, while solar\nradiation and the cold space background lead to high\nthermal radiation gradients with correspondingly\nhigh temperature gradients on the satellite.\n\nA satellite consists of a multitude of materials,\ncomponents and subsystems, all of which have to be\nkept in their specified operational temperature range\nto ensure proper functioning (e.g., electronic subsys-\ntems) or to avoid material damage and shape distor-\ntions on structural parts (e.g., antenna reflectors).\n\nTo ensure compliance with the temperature\nranges in all mission phases, a wide range of passive\nand active temperature control mechanisms may be\nutilized, starting with selected surfaces (black, white,\nmetallic, etc.) with well-defined absorption and emis-\nsion properties (a/\u00e9 values) and continuing with\nmultilayer insulation (MLI) foils, heat straps, heat\npipes and temperature-controlled electric heaters.\nAll the temperature control measures taken together\nare commonly called the thermal control subsystem\n(TCS), although it cannot be treated as an indepen-\ndent subsystem like a satellite bus or an antenna\nreflector.\n\nIn the past TCS configuration has mainly been\nan experimental process based on test data.

This data\nallows verification and optimization of the satellite\u2019s\nnumerical thermal model. Generally, it is not neces-\nsary to verify all the possible load cases of a mission by\ntesting; evaluation of some specific (extreme) cases is\nnormally sufficient. It can be assumed that other cases\ncan be correctly evaluated if the (adapted) thermal\nmodel can correctly verify the measured cases.\n\nThe thermal balance test is normally performed\nwith a cold chamber shroud (cooled with liquid\nnitrogen) at temperatures below \u2014180\u00b0C to simulate\nthe space background. Each mission phase is then\nrepresented by a corresponding solar radiation flux\nlevel or heated thermal plates (albedo and Earth\nradiation simulation). After stabilization the resulting\ntemperature equilibrium on the satellite is measured\nand recorded.\n\n8.3.4.2 Bakeout Test\n\nTesting space-related components (solar panels, elec-\ntronic units, antennas, etc.) is another important task\nof thermal vacuum tests. The main aspect is qualifi-\ncation for later use in space. A so-called bakeout test\nis performed for every important part of a satellite\nthat goes into space. During this test, it is exposed to\nvacuum in order to force outgassing in the operational\ntemperature range of the component.\n\nIn vacuum the test specimen is heated up to a\ntemperature level above the operational temperature.\nDepending on the mission parameter and type of\ncomponent, a typical temperature range of about\n+80\u00b0C to +150\u00b0C is used. The test specimen is ex-\nposed to such an environment for at least 24 hours,\nand sometimes significantly longer.\n\nOn the ground, the bakeout test ensures the out-\ngassing of most of the volatile components (hydro-\ncarbons, silicones, esters, water, etc.) coming from the\nproduction process in order to prevent the satellite\nfrom becoming contaminated. The satellite speed\n\nCHO8.indd 683\n\n683\n\nin orbit is in the same range as the molecular speed\nof outgassed material at a total pressure level of\n<10>mbar (the satellite may even be faster), which\nis the reason why the material does not detach from\nthe satellite. In fact, the components form a cloud\naround the satellite and condense on the satellite\u2019s\ncold surfaces. This is a huge problem for the optical\nsubsystems or solar cells, for instance, which may\nbecome coated and fail.\n\n8.3.4.3 Thermal Vacuum Test\n\nBakeout tests are often combined with thermal vacu-\num cycling (TV or TVC) tests. Here either space com-\nponents or the whole satellite are exposed to several\ntemperature cycles under vacuum conditions. The\nnumber of cycles, as well as the hot and cold tempera-\nture extremes, have to be defined with respect to the\nmission parameters. Typically, the lower temperature\nis in the range of \u2014100 to \u2014180\u00b0C, whereas the upper\ntemperature of the cycles is normally in the range of\n+80 to +130\u00b0C. Nevertheless, specific missions may\nrequire hot phases of up to +200\u00b0C, which can be real-\nized in specially designed thermal vacuum chambers\n(e.g., the 2m thermal vacuum chamber of IABG mbH\nin Ottobrunn, Germany).\n\nThe test specimen is brought to the desired tem-\nperature by heat exchange, either by radiation with\nthe thermal shroud of the test chamber or directly\nby a thermal plate on which the test specimen is\nmounted.\n\nParticularly large test items or those with thermal\nproperties that do not allow good temperature adjust-\nment by radiation require a long test duration during\nTVC tests and are therefore very expensive. Sometimes\nonly parts of the test item \u2014 like metal inserts inside a\ncarbon fiber antenna \u2014 are responsible for extending\nthe test time.\n\nThe maximum or minimum temperatures for\nsingle parts of a test item may be different from those\nfor the main part of the test item. For example, a\nwaveguide in an antenna tower assembly may need\nto be tested at a higher temperature level than what\nis required for the antenna reflector itself. It is also\npossible that during the cold phase specific antenna\ncomponents may not be allowed get as cold as the\nantenna itself.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:35 PM\n",

Either\ninfrared radiators or directly applied electric heaters\nare used for the purpose. The development of a ther-\nmal vacuum test concept meeting the customer\u2019s re-\nquirements is one of the main tasks of a test center.\n\n8.3.4.4 Thermal Cycling Test\n\nIf thermal cycling can be performed without vacuum,\nthe test duration \u2014 and the costs \u2014 can be reduced\nsignificantly. During a thermal cycling (TC) test or\nan ambient pressure thermal cycling (APTC) test\nin an APTC chamber, a dry nitrogen gas atmosphere\nis heated and cooled under atmospheric pressure to\nquickly change the temperature of the test item using\ndirect convection. Because the medium circulates at a\nlow flow speed inside the chamber (approx. 1-3 m/s),\nhigh temperature gradients from about 5 to above\n30\u00b0C/min are possible. The duration of the test is\nsignificantly influenced by the mass of the test article.\n\nSubjecting parts of the test article to their own\nindividual temperatures is, however, not possible in\nan APTC chamber, something which has to be taken\ninto account when developing the test concept.\n\nAn APTC test is normally combined with a bake-\nout test ora thermal vacuum cycle so that the test item\nis exposed to vacuum at least for a short duration in\norder to accelerate the outgassing process.\n\n8.3.4.5 OSTC Test\n\nAt the end of their production, solar panels undergo a\nspecial on-stage thermal cycling (OSTC) test.\n\nDuring this test a solar panel is exposed to\ntemperature cycling stress in order to simulate the\nconditions of its subsequent operation in near-Earth\norbit. In orbit the solar panel\u2019s cell side always faces\nthe Sun, while the back faces the cold space back-\nground. This results in high temperature gradients\nthrough the thin panel structure. Additionally, in\nEarth orbit the solar radiation is periodically inter-\nrupted when the spacecraft enters the umbra.\n\nTo simulate this load profile in a test and thus\nqualify a solar array, the thermal vacuum chamber is\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nfirst cooled to a temperature below \u2014180\u00b0C using liquid\nnitrogen. A strong infrared lamp unit facing the cell side\nof the solar panel periodically heats that side to the re-\nquired qualification temperature. A radiation intensity\nof 8kW/m\u201d causes heating of the solar panel from \u2014170\nto +130\u00b0C in less than 30 min. After the infrared source\nis switched off, the panel cools down again, which may\ntake up to 7h (cooling to -175\u00b0C), depending on the\nrequired minimum temperature (Figure 8.3.13).\n\nThe cycles are combined with preceding tempera-\nture regulating phases which heat up the test specimen\nin specific stages, first under ambient pressure condi-\ntions and then under vacuum.\n\nSuch a test sequence reveals possible fabrication\nfaults such as chipped solar cells, structural cracks,\nunexpected color changes, or detachments of the\npanel substrate.\n\n8.3.4.6 Thermal Distortion Test\n\nHeavy geometric demands are made on antenna re-\nflectors in space. These reflectors are shaped according\nto the transmission region on the ground in order\nto follow regional borders (countries, continents)\nas closely as possible. The reflector shape must not\nvary under thermal loads or after outgassing. The\nlimit for dimensional stability is in the range of a\nfew microns. The stability is measured optically in a\nthermal vacuum chamber by using high-resolution\ncalibrated photographic cameras (digital photogram-\nmetry, videogrammetry).

However, all facilities\nneed to fulfill the basic requirements for the test of\nspace equipment, namely the simulation of:\n\ne Vacuum\n\ne Cold background radiation\n\ne Solar radiation\n\ne Earth radiation, albedo radiation, etc.\n\ne High temperatures.\n\nA typical facility is shown in Figure 8.3.18. The numbers\nin the following discussion relate to this diagram.\n\nThe main components of a thermal vacuum\ntest chamber are a stainless steel vessel with a con-\nnected vacuum system and a black-painted thermal\nshroud inside \u00a9, driven by a thermal system. With\nthis equipment, the test specimen can be exposed to\nvacuum and heated or cooled by the thermal wall.\nEvery thermal vacuum test chamber meets these\nbasic prerequisites. For space simulation tests a solar\nsimulator is additionally required. A projector with\nan integrated lens system @ and a collimation mirror\n@ directs the light from high-pressure xenon lamps \u00a9\nfirst through a quartz window into the vacuum cham-\nber and then into the test area \u00ae in order to simulate\nthe natural collimation and intensity of sunlight. A\nmotion simulator enables orientation of the satellite\nwith respect to the artificial solar beam.\n\nThe temperature of the test specimen is the\nmost important measurement in space simulation.\nTherefore, up to 1000 thermocouples are attached to\nthe specimen and their values scanned and recorded\nat intervals of 10s to 1 min.\n\nThe Vacuum System\n\nRequirements related to the vacuum system are de-\nrived from the demand that heat transfer due to\nconvection by any gas components present has to\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nbe negligible compared to heat transfer due to ra-\ndiation. It is assumed that the mean free path of the\ngas molecules is long with respect to the distances\nbetween surfaces involved in the heat exchange. This\nrequirement is normally fulfilled with a chamber pres-\nsure <1.3x 107\u00b0 mbar. This pressure level (or simply\n\u201c10\u00b0 mbar\u201d) is therefore typically defined as the\nrequisite criterion for thermal vacuum tests.\n\nThe design of a vacuum system is performed for\na working pressure of <10~\u00b0mbar, also taking into\naccount the outgassing rates of the facility and the\ntest items.\n\nCryopumps and oil-free turbomolecular pumps\nare mainly used for the vacuum supply. This type of\npump ensures that no contamination of the chamber\nor the test item with pump oil can occur. Cryopumps\nhave no movable parts. The pumping effect is achieved\nonly by freezing the gas components on cold surfaces.\nFurthermore, they provide a high pumping capacity in\nhigh vacuum, which makes them particularly suitable\nfor large test facilities. Six cryopumps are installed at the\nspace simulation facility of IABG. With individual valve\ngates they can be separated from the test chamber for\nrecovery during test operation. For smaller chambers\noften only a turbomolecular pump is sufficient. Since\nhigh vacuum pumps can only be used below a pressure\nlevel of 10! mbar, the vacuum vessel is initially evacu-\nated with mechanical pumps (e.g., Roots pumps).\n\nThe Thermal System\n\nLiquid nitrogen is generally used as a working medium\nin thermal systems to cool the black-painted thermal\nshrouds down to a temperature level of 80-100 K. The\nsimulation errors resulting from the higher background\ntemperature compared to the exact background tem-\nperature of about 2.7K are usually small and can be\ntaken into account in numerical simulations.\n\nA fixed tank facility with pressure regulation is\nused for the liquid nitrogen supply, which allows an\nadjustable pressure level of 1-5 bar.\n\nFor heating up the chamber after testing and espe-\ncially for thermal cycling, a blower and heater system\nare necessary to heat the nitrogen flow to the required\ntest temperature. For this procedure, the gas stream is\ncycled in a closed loop and conditioned with electric\nheaters and heat exchangers. The performance of the\nthermal system is mainly defined by the achievable\nheating and cooling gradients on the one hand and\n\n2/24/09 2:50:41 PM\n",

The layout of\nthe nitrogen pipes is also an important performance\ncriterion for the thermal system. On the one hand, all\nparts of the shroud segments have to be uniformly\nbrought to the desired temperature using both liq-\nuid and gaseous nitrogen, but on the other hand no\ngas reservoirs should remain in the shroud while in\nliquid nitrogen mode since this would cause high\ntemperature gradients inside the shroud.\n\nSolar Simulation\n\nThe solar intensity in near-Earth orbit is 1371 W/m?\n(solar constant, SC) with a collimation of about 32 arc\nminutes. Solar simulators in the major European test\ncenters (see, e.g., Figure 8.3.19) are able to generate\na light intensity up to approx. 1900W/m\u2019 (1.4SC)\nin a test plane with a collimation of +2\u00b0, which is a\nvalue sufficient to prevent simulation errors caused\nby shadows. Further typical requirements for solar\nsimulation are of course uniform distribution across\nthe test plane (e.g., <4%), but also in the defined\ntesting volume (e.g., <5%); the temporal stability\n\nCHO8.indd 687\n\nFigure 8.3.18:\nSketch of IABG's\nSpace simula-\ntion test facil-\nity (Source:\n\n\u00ae TABG).\n\n7 Xe lamps, 25 kW each\n\nof the light source; and the spectral distribution of\nthe light itself.

For the illumination of the test plane\n(diameters of 3-6 mare installed in Europe), between\n7 and 20 high-pressure xenon bulbs are needed to\nreach the required intensity. Spare bulbs have to be\navailable in case of failure. Each bulb has its own power\nsupply and cooling system. Cooling is also a main issue\nfor the integrator. In the focus the light of the xenon\nlamps is guided through a lens system that would heat\nup strongly without cooling. Here the challenge is to\ndesign a highly transparent lens system with cooling\nloops for every single lens involved.\n\nThe big collimation mirror is the most eye-catch-\ning component of the solar simulator. Consisting of\na large number of individually adjusted and cooled\nmirror segments, it reflects the light coming from the\nintegrator into the test plane. Each individual segment\nis adjusted according to a complex procedure so that\nthe defined uniformity and geometry can be achieved\non the test plane.\n\nHaving the collimation mirror at the right tem-\nperature has another important function: if not pro-\ntected by a shutter which has been shroud cooled\nwith nitrogen, the mirror would also face the satellite\nwhen solar simulation is switched off. It would thereby\nrepresent a totally different heat source for the satellite\nthan do the black surrounding thermal shrouds. This\nhas to be taken into account, for example, in numerical\nsimulations. In order to protect the mirror itself from\ncontamination by condensation of outgassed compo-\nnents, it is always kept at a higher temperature than the\nshroud and the test item. Cooling and heating of the\nindividual mirror segments are mostly performed by\na separate nitrogen circuit of the thermal system.\n\nThe Motion Simulator\n\nThe motion simulator represents the interface be-\ntween the satellite and the test facility. Its main task\nis to position the satellite, which is connected to\nthe spin drive via a thermal test adapter, in the re-\nquired orientation with respect to the direction of the\nsunlight or the gravity vector. The swivel angle can\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nbe adjusted by 180\u00b0, the spin by 360\u00b0. To simulate\nthe spin stabilization of a satellite, the spin axis can\nbe continuously rotated at several rotations per min-\nute (up to 10 or 20rpm). All measurement signals\n(e.g., 500 temperature signals) and supply lines from\nand to the satellite have to be connected to corre-\nsponding slip-ring units. In addition to a supported\nsatellite mass of up to 5 tonnes, the motion simulator\nmoves its own arm, weighing 20 tonnes, with a posi-\ntioning accuracy of a few hundredths of a degree. At\nthe same time the self-deformation of the motion\nsimulator due to gravity has to be kept to a minimum.\nTherefore, it has to be designed so it is stiff enough.\nHigh positioning accuracy is also required to test the\nfunction of heat pipes and the deployment of anten-\nnas at the satellite. Since those components are de-\nsigned for zero-gravity operation, accurate orientation\nwith respect to the gravity vector is necessary.\n\nThe motion simulator should not induce any ther-\nmal effects on the test specimen. It is therefore covered\nwith a thermal shroud and has the same temperature\nas the chamber shroud. Since all actuators and control\ncomponents of the motion simulator have to be suf-\nficiently cooled for operation, even under atmospheric\nconditions, the whole internal part of the motion\nsimulator is kept at atmospheric pressure with an air\nventing system. This also results in demanding require-\nments regarding the tightness of all moving joints and\naxles in direct contact with the chamber vacuum. The\nsum of all those requirements makes the construction\nof a motion simulator one of the most complex engi-\nneering challenges of a space simulation facility.\n\n8.3.5 EMC and Magnetics\n\n8.3.5.1 Electromagnetic Compatibility\n\nAim and Purpose\n\nNo space flight system can be managed without elec-\ntronic and electromechanical components fulfilling\ndiverse complex functions. Besides the intended elec-\ntrical signals, often unintended emissions are sent out\nwhich may disturb other components or subsystems\nin their function. In addition, strong high-frequency\nelectromagnetic fields exist which guarantee the\ncommunication with the ground station, transfer\ntelemetry signals or measure radar signatures.

    "710": "8.3. Environmental Tests and Basic Concepts\n\ntalking about electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)\nthe conflict \u201cdisturb or be disturbed\u201d is considered. In\norder to guarantee compatibility, EMC must keep the\nunwanted emissions below a given limit on the one\nhand, and guarantee immunity to disturbances from\nthe outside (susceptibility to interference) on the other\nhand. The bigger the margin between the emission and\nimmunity, the bigger the reserves for compatibility.\nThese two values are determined by different methods\nof testing in an EMC laboratory.\n\nDisturbing Signals and Their Propagation\nComponents working with clock pulses or switching\nfrequencies (e.g., DC/DC converters, personal com-\nputer components) are known to be typical sources of\ndisturbance. Power electronics with fast switching op-\nerations (pulse width controlled actuators or motors)\nare also known as a source of disturbing interference.\nFast switching pulses and high currents produce spec-\ntra up to high frequencies. Switching transients in the\nelectrical supply system affect all connected subcompo-\nnents. High-frequency disturbances can travel via the\ncabling (conducted emission) and be radiated either\ndirectly from the housing or the cables as an electro-\nmagnetic field (radiated emission). Natural effects can\nalso generate disturbance signals, such as the discharge\nof static electricity (ESD) or a stroke of lightning into\nthe launch vehicle shortly before launch.\n\nWhen thinking of immunity it is necessary to assess\nall components and systems as to their susceptibility to\nbecoming interference sinks. Experience shows that, for\nexample, components which convey small analogous\nsignals (signal amplifier, signal conditioning, scientific\nexperiments) are regarded as extremely susceptible to ex-\nternal influences. Caution is advised wherever interfaces\nlead to the outside and come into the range of transmit-\nting antennas. Conducting susceptibility tests on single\nleads, and cable bundles, as well as radiating susceptibil-\nity tests are undertaken in immunity testing.\n\nEMC Analysis and Procedure\n\nThe objective of the analysis is to determine those\nrequirements for the system and the subcomponents\nwhich guarantee EMC. These requirements are listed\nin a specification together with other mechanical or\nspace simulation requirements, normally starting by\nlisting the outer high-frequency fields (extra EMC)\nand taking not only the test object itself but also the\n\nCHO8.indd 689\n\n689\n\nequipment of the launcher into account. From these\nfields a possible \u201cthreat scenario\u201d is derived by taking\nthe shielding attenuation of the outer casing into\nconsideration. Furthermore, the immunity level is\ndetermined. Conversely, the emission limits for the\nsubcomponents are determined, starting with the in-\nner components and the radiation to the outside.\n\nRegarding the compatibility of the systems among\nthemselves (intra EMC), basically propagation via\nlines is responsible. It is necessary to analyze signals\nin more detail and to find a reasonable compromise\nwith reference to the reduction of emissions and the\nincrease of immunity. This process proceeds mostly\nin an iterative way by means of experimental results\nand experience.\n\nEMC Test Methods and Equipment\n\nAs stated above, the methods can be subdivided as\nbeing for conducted and radiated emission and for\nconducted and radiated susceptibility. In physics,\neach signal can be described by a function in the time\ndomain as well as in the frequency domain. Both\nmethods are used in EMC testing procedures.\n\nIndividual coupling devices (transducers) be-\nlong to all test methods. They establish a connection\nbetween the measuring instrument and the physical\nvalue to be coupled to or from the unit under test.\nMany transducers have frequency-dependent factors.\nTheir values have to be calibrated regularly and taken\ninto account when the signals are converted.\n\nThe central part of an EMC laboratory is a shielded\nchamber (see Figure 8.3.20). Considering that our en-\nvironment is almost everywhere extensively supplied\nwith communication services of all kinds (e.g., radio\nand television broadcasts, mobile telephones), all of\nwhich use high-frequency signal transmission, it must\nbe guaranteed that their signals do not disturb an EMC\ntest. For this reason the object to be tested is placed in\na shielded chamber consisting of a metal cabin which\ndoes not allow radiation in any direction. It can thus\nbe assured that the signals measured inside the facility\nactually come from the test object itself and not from the\nenvironment. High-quality chambers achieve more than\n100 dB screen attenuation up to 18 GHz. A precondition\nis the filtering of all supply and communication lines.\n\nThe test method of radiated susceptibility is\nperformed with radiated electromagnetic fields.\nWithout additional provisions the metallic surface\n\n2/24/09 2:50:43 PM\n",

This field distribution does not\ncorrespond to the outdoor far-field condition and\nwould falsify a test. In order to suppress wall reflec-\ntions, the inside of the shielded chamber is covered\nwith absorbers which absorb radiation and convert it\ninto heat. Under electromagnetic considerations these\nare the given conditions of an infinite space and thus\nof homogeneous field distribution.\n\nThe thermal efficiency of absorbers is limited. This\nfeature has to be considered in a risk analysis and is par-\nticularly relevant whenever the strong high-frequency\nsources of the test object are switched on (e.g., the radar\nantenna or the communications antenna of a satellite).\n\n8.3.5.2 Magnetics (Magnetic Cleanliness)\n\nMission-critical instruments (e.g., magnetometers)\non-board scientific satellites in particular need to be\nprotected from spurious magnetic DC fields generated\nby the satellite itself or its components.\n\nThis is typically achieved by running a so-called\nmagnetic cleanliness program. This program\nminimizes the magnetic sources on-board a satellite\nby employing the following strategy:\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\n1. Wherever possible, avoid the use of ferromagnetic\nmaterials.\n\n2. As early as possible, identify the magnetic\nsources.\n\n3. Characterize all identified sources by modeling\nand measuring their magnetic behavior.\n\n4, Create a magnetic model of the satellite based on\nthe characterized sources.\n\n5. After assembly of the satellite, measure and calcu-\n\nate the influence of all magnetic sources on the\n\ninstrumentation.\n\n6. If necessary, try to minimize the magnetic field at\n\nthe location of the instruments by compensation.\n\nIn order to characterize the magnetic effects of a\nsatellite or its components, a distinction between hard\nand soft magnetic effects is necessary. Hard magnetic\neffects can be directly traced back to the component;\nthe soft magnetic effects on a component are induced\nby the Earth\u2019s magnetic background field. A special\ntest setup allows measurement of the component\nin a magnetically compensated area and therefore\nsimulates on the ground the magnetic environment\nof space. IABG operates a magnetic field simulation\nassembly (MFSA) as part of the ESA coordinated test\nfacilities, providing the test environment required to\ncharacterize components up to a complete satellite\nduring a magnetic cleanliness program.\n\nFigure 8.3.21 shows the setup of this facility sche-\nmatically. The use of a special constellation of Helm-\nholz coils allows suppression of the magnetic field of\nthe Earth and therefore the generation of a space free\nof magnetic fields.\n\nMagnetic Cleanliness Program\n\nNearly all magnetic field experiments on-board a\nsatellite suffer from the contamination of DC or\nlow-frequency magnetic fields generated by the space-\ncraft itself. This problem is known as the magnetic\ncleanliness (MC) problem. It should be noted that\nthe noise of the magnetic field generated by the sub-\nsystems of a satellite from DC to some 10Hz is not\ncovered by the standard EMC program or magnetic\nverification plans, which typically start at 50 Hz. The\nEMC program also does not recognize any magnetized\nelements of the structure and the harness which may\ncause \u201cDC contamination\u201d of the magnetometer\nmeasurements. For these reasons a special program\n\n2/24/09 2:50:43 PM\n",

The magnetic field of the unit to\nbe characterized is scanned during these measure-\nments. The unit is placed on a turntable and rotated\nhorizontally around the vertical axis of the turntable.\nA mathematical multidipole model is calculated based\non these measurements. This model represents the\nbest-fitting approximation between measurements\nand model. The results of these measurements are\ncombined with the geometrical information about the\norigin and orientation of every unit on-board the satel-\nlite and used to build up a magnetic system model of\nthe satellite. This model gives an idea about which unit\ncontributes most to the magnetic field at the position\nof the magnetometer on the satellite and the strength\nof the part of the magnetic field that is compensated\nby different units of the satellite. Therefore, this model\nhelps to decide whether or not to compensate the mag-\nnetic field at the position of the magnetometer.\n\nThe system model typically gives only a rough esti-\nmation of the magnetic fields expected. This behavior\nis related to the model\u2019s limits. It is not always able to\npredict the mutual interaction of different components\ncorrectly and of course it is always possible that not all\nmagnetically significant units are identified and added\nto the model. Therefore a so-called magnetic system\ntest is performed to verify the system model by measure-\nment. From this point on, monitoring of the complete\nmagnetic environment of the satellite starts by placing\nmagnetometers close to the satellite and recording the\nreadings. This monitoring is carried out continuously\nduring integration and until the launch of the satellite.\nThe magnetometers are configured so that they trigger\nan alarm if defined thresholds are exceeded.\n\n8.3.6 Special Environmental and\nFunctional Tests\n\n8.3.6.1 Special Environmental Tests\n\nDepending on the mission, it might be necessary to\nperform special environmental tests in order to cover\nspecial needs. Some examples using current projects\nare listed below.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nMicrovibration\nZero gravity offers perfect conditions, for example, for\ninvestigating new technologies in materials research\nor examining the Earth with very precise equipment.\nCurrent examples are materials research on the ISS\nand the exploration of the gravity field of the Earth\nin the context of ESA\u2019s Gravity Field and Steady-State\nOcean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) project. These\nmissions demand the absence of disturbing accel-\nerations ranging from several milli-g down to the\nmicro-g region. Over the years it has been discovered\nthat the reasons for microvibration are manifold.\nBesides the active elements on board a spacecraft\n(mechanisms and altitude control, the crew), mainly\npassive components such as the satellite bus, solar\narray or antennas tend to cause microvibration as a\nconsequence of thermal loads, due to the spontane-\nous release of thermal stress. Even the thermally\ninduced compensational movements of the insulation\nfoil (MLI) may cause microvibration to a disturbing\nextent.\nIn order to keep microvibration under control and\nbe able to estimate it before a mission, microvibration\nbudgets are defined in the design phase and broken\ndown to the equipment level. On this basis, so-called\nmicrovibration measurements are performed in\nthe course of the qualification activities in order to\ndetermine the operational vibration behavior. Cur-\nrently, there are mainly three different examination\nmethods:\n\n1. Direct measurement of the interface forces\n(direct interface force method (DIFM)):\nThe object is clamped onto a seismic block\nequipped with force measurement devices at\nits interfaces. The generated forces created by\noperation of the device in the low-frequency\nrange (typically 0.01 Hz up to some 10 Hz) can\nbe determined directly at the interface. These\ninterface forces can then be directly used to es-\ntimate the disturbing vibrations for the whole\nsystem.\n\n2. Indirect measurement of the interface forces\n(indirect interface force method (IIFM)):\nIn the case of higher frequencies, the in-\nterfaces can no longer be regarded as being\nstiff.

In order to verify the interface\nforces, the transmitting functions at the inter-\nface patches are experimentally determined\nand together with the measured acceleration\nspectra converted into force spectra. The\nfrequency range of this method is from some\n10 Hz up to 500 Hz, and sometimes even up\ninto the kilohertz range.\n\n3. Thermal microvibration tests gain more\nand more interest in the context of the choice\nof suitable MLI foils. With this method, foil\nspecimens up to a square meter in size are at-\ntached to a plate with known eigenfrequencies.\nThis fixture is suspended at low frequency in\na thermal vacuum chamber and exposed to\nspace conditions. By means of infrared lamps\nthe foils are exposed to thermal conditions.\nTheir behavior is then registered optically\nas well as with very sensitive accelerometers\nmounted on the plate. The thermally induced\nmovements of the MLI excite eigenfrequencies\nin the plate, thus giving an insight into the\nactivity of the MLI foil. The power spectral\ndensity of the background vibrations required\nfor these examinations should not exceed\n\n1-10\u00b0?\u00a2/Hz.\n\nSpecial Optical Measurements of the Linear\nExpansion of Camera Structures\n\nFor camera structures on Earth observation satellites,\nessential performance parameters are the expanding\ncoefficients of the structure, which should preferably\nbe very low. A change in the length of the structure\ncaused by temperature differences has an impact\non the focal distance and thus on the quality of\nthe resulting images. In order to specify the length\nexpansion of a structure, highly precise optical mea-\nsurements of the structure are performed during a\nthermal vacuum test. The measurement accuracy to\nbe achieved is usually within < +2.8 1m. In order to\nachieve such high accuracy it is necessary to eliminate\nany disturbance in the broader environment of the\nfacility created by the surroundings, such as move-\nment of masses by pumps, air-conditioning, motors,\nair, persons, etc.\n\nCHO8.indd 693\n\n693\n\n8.3.6.2 Functional Tests\n\nFunctional tests are performed in order to verify the\nproper functioning of the respective system or of\nseveral systems together. There are a wide variety of\nfunctional tests depending on the mission and they\ncan be adapted to meet special requirements. They can\nbe categorized into three groups, as follows.\n\nIndependently Performed Functional Tests\n\nThe independently performed functional tests are\nusually very complex and extensive tests performed\nseparately from the environmental tests. Some ex-\namples are listed below:\n\ne Compact Test Range (CPTR): A CPTR as oper-\nated at Astrium in Ottobrunn offers the possibility\nto carry out performance tests on the antennas\nof a complete satellite, including the integrated\npayload. The radiation characteristics of antennas,\nparticularly those with large reflectors, are usually\nspecified for the far field. As these characteristics\ncannot be proven precisely enough with short\nmeasuring distances, a homogeneous field is cre-\nated by means of a CPTR with one or more tilted\nmirrors at a short distance whose characteristics\nare identical to those of a far field. This makes it\npossible to determine the high-frequency charac-\nteristics of the antenna at a short distance, such as\ngain, half beam width, sidelobe suppression and\ncross-polar suppression. For the foreseen illumina-\ntion of the defined area, for example for the supply\nof countries or continents with television signals,\nthe parameters mentioned above are the basis for\nthe antenna design.\n\ne Firing Test for Solid Propellant Boosters: In order\nto verify the functioning of a booster as well as\nthe operating parameters (thrust, internal pres-\nsure, firing speed, temperature behavior during\nand after firing, nozzle control) firing tests are\nperformed. They are very complex because they\nrequire test rigs which can absorb the enormous\npropulsive forces on the one hand (e.g., the Ariane\n5 booster) and on the other hand also allow the\nrealization of the mechanical boundary condi-\ntions as they occur during flight. Moreover, such a\nbooster test requires approximately the same effort\nas a real launch. Apart from the functioning of the\n\n2/24/09 2:50:47 PM\n",

The most\nimportant test stands in Europe are operated by\nthe German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Lampolds-\nhausen, Germany, and by the SAFRANE company\nin Vernon, France.\n\ne Separation Tests: During the launch of a rocket\nand the beginning of a mission, several separa-\ntion processes are carried out (stage separation,\ndropping of the payload fairing, separation of the\npayload, deployment of the solar arrays, etc.). The\nstate of the art is to initiate them with pyrotechnics\nin order to guarantee high precision and the appro-\npriate separation forces. It is very important that\nthe separation processes work flawlessly and ho-\nmogeneously, and that the separated parts do not\ncollide with the remaining system. This procedure\nis validated during so-called separation tests.\n\ne Communication Tests between Satellite and\nGround Station: After the satellite has been re-\nleased into orbit, it is essential that the commu-\nnication between the satellite and the ground\nstation functions and that the satellite reacts as\nplanned to all commands from the ground station.

Since then, not much has changed in\nthe nature of environmental simulations because\nthe environmental conditions (vibration, acoustic\nload, electromagnetic radiation, high vacuum, solar\nradiation and space background temperature) for a\nsatellite in orbit have essentially remained unchanged.\nThe environmental conditions vary only slightly\ndepending on the mission, and only special explora-\ntion missions, such as to the Sun or to planets in the\nclose vicinity of the Sun, like Mercury, require specific\nmeasures.\n\nChanges in space flight are the result of the per-\nformance increase of rockets. The total mass and\ndimensions of satellites have significantly increased\nover the years, and test facilities including the in-\nfrastructure need to be adapted accordingly. At the\nsame time, the development process of a satellite has\n\nCHO8.indd 695\n\n695\n\nshortened significantly. This results in the following\n\nfacility requirements:\n\ne Increased volumes and satellite masses need to be\naccommodated.\n\ne Required accelerations still need to be achieved\ndespite increased masses.\n\ne Radiation areas and intensities need to meet re-\nquirements.\n\ne Compatibility with the increased number of mea-\nsurement channels due to the larger dimensions\nof specimens needs to be assured.\n\n\u00a9 Operational readiness needs to be guaranteed in\na flexible, fast and cost-effective way.\n\nIt is expected that this trend will continue in the fu-\nture. However, it is also expected that the simulation\nof tests will increase.\n\nSimulation techniques, theoretical models of\nspace vehicles (e.g., via multiple use of satellite buses)\nas well as computational capacity are continually\nimproving. Any simulation yields errors to some\nextent, and those errors can only be determined via\ntesting. The same applies to manufacturing defects.\nImproved theoretical models together with previ-\nously simulated tests are important for efficiently\nconducting tests and understanding the achieved\nresults.\n\nAdditional essential requirements for test centers\nare:\n\ne Test centers must be operated independently\nfrom the manufacturer in order to remain un-\nbiased and neutral with respect to the test re-\nsults and the customer. This independence also\nguarantees confidentiality of the information\ngained, such as test results and technical details,\ndrawings, etc.\n\ne Test centers must guarantee that all customers\nand projects are treated equally, independent of\ncompany size and/or project dimensions, and that\nnone are treated in a privileged way.\n\ne Space test centers are required to operate under\neconomic and commercial constraints, respecting\ndecreases in budgets for projects and infrastruc-\nture. Another complicating aspect is that a space\ntest center accommodates very maintenance-\nintensive facilities which usually are single-unit\nproductions.\n\n2/24/09 2:50:49 PM\n",

Especially in the\ncase of interplanetary missions, overall mass reduction\nis of the highest importance because of the relatively\nsmall payload mass compared to other missions. One\npossible way to reduce cost is miniaturization. The\ncost for applications which can be realized by satel-\nlite missions can be reduced by using lightweight\nand small satellites. One of the latest activities in the\ndirection of miniaturization is the development of\npicosatellites. Based on the work of two universities in\nthe USA, namely Stanford University and California\nPolytechnic State University, a standard for picosatel-\nlites, called CubeSat, has been developed. CubeSats\nare picosatellites with a maximum mass of 1kg and\ndimensions of 10 x 10 x 10 cm. The standard is based\non a deployment mechanism, the so-called P-POD,\nwhich can handle two or three CubeSats, allowing the\npayload mass to be increased accordingly. Today, more\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nthan 60 universities and diverse companies are work-\ning on CubeSats. Figure 8.4.1 shows an engineering\nmodel of a CubeSat. The applications for this class of\nsatellites are still limited because components which\nexist for larger satellites are not available for CubeSats.\nThe development of CubeSats is at an early stage.\n\nThe attitude control plays a special role here.\nA well-defined orientation is essential for many ap-\nplications such as Earth observation or astronomy,\notherwise the target of the observation would be\nmissed.\n\nIn order to be able to control the attitude it must\nfirst be determined which sensors are to be used.\nFor most of the attitude sensors known from larger\nsatellites, such as star trackers, Sun sensors, gyros or\nEarth sensors, no appropriate versions are available\nfor picosatellites. Existing sensors are too large, too\nheavy and require too much power. There is a similar\nsituation for attitude control actuators. That is why in\nmost CubeSats today permanent magnets or magnetic\ncoils are used for attitude control. In many cases there\nis no attitude control at all.\n\nAnother bottleneck in the design of picosatellites\nis communications. Many applications, such as Earth\nobservation, require the collection and transmission\nof large amounts of data to the ground station. The\ntypical communication bands used today are the\nUHF and VHF bands, allowing limited data rates in\nthe range of 1.2 to 9.6 kbit/s. Thus it takes a very long\ntime to transmit larger images, which would make\nsuch applications practically impossible.\n\nFigure 8.4.1: Engineering model of a CubeSat (Source: TU-Berlin).\n\n2/24/09 2:50:50 PM\n",
    "718": "8.4 System Design Example: CubeSat\n\nIn order to reduce the lack of such components\nand to allow more demanding applications, projects\nare already in progress at different places or new ones\nare being planned. Two examples are microwheels\nsuitable for picosatellites and an extremely low-energy\nS-band transmitter.\n\nOne of the advantages of miniaturization is the\npotential use of these components in larger satel-\nlites, such as nanosatellites. S-band transmitters for\nexample can also be used in nanosatellites and would\nhelp to maximize the payload capacity remarkably.\nThe same is of course true for other components, such\nas sensors for attitude determination. This additional\npayload capacity could then, for example, be used for\nlarger optics, which would enable nanosatellites to\nrun applications for which normally small satellites\nwould be needed.\n\nThe number of potential applications for pico-\nsatellites will increase with the use of more and more\nsuitable components. Especially promising are appli-\ncations in conjunction with constellations or forma-\ntions due to the low launch costs. Using constellations,\nit might be possible to build sensor networks in space\nwhere each of the satellites would take measurements\nsimultaneously at different positions in orbit. Some\nof the application fields can be Earth observation,\nobservation of astronomical objects or space weather.\nThis approach makes it possible to organize a much\ndenser network of sensors than would be possible\nwith larger satellites for cost reasons. It is conceivable\nto use either the same or different types of sensors on\neach satellite in the constellation, which also increases\nsystem redundancy. Moreover, it might be possible in\nthe future to combine the sensors of satellites within\na formation to increase the aperture of an observa-\ntion system.\n\nAnother field of application is to use picosatellites\nfor exploration of the Solar System. Picosatellites\ncould, for example, be ejected from larger spacecraft\norbiting a planet and support the tasks of a probe, a\nsurface-bound system or a rover.\n\nAn additional application field for picosatellites is\nthe verification of miniaturized components which,\nas mentioned above, are becoming more and more\nimportant. Miniaturized components can be verified\nin orbit much more frequently and at much lower cost\nby using picosatellites.\n\nCHO8.indd 697\n\n697\n\n8.4.2 Mission Concepts and Scenarios\n\nA typical CubeSat mission, like any other satellite mis-\nsion, consists of the following mission elements:\n\u00a9 Mission objective\n\ne Payload\ne Satellite bus\ne Orbit\n\ne Launch segment\ne Ground segment.\n\nThere are many similarities with respect to the sys-\ntematics and tasks of the mission elements. However,\nthe extent of these elements must be adjusted to the\nconstraints, which in the case of CubeSats mostly\nmean that there is a very limited budget, limited time\nanda lack of experience on the part of the developers.\nThus the first steps in establishing a CubeSat mission\nare to define the time frame and budget and to define\nthe mission objectives.\n\n8.4.2.1 Mission Objective\n\nThe mission objective is the real task, the actual\nmeaning of each CubeSat mission. The expectation\nfor many scientific or technological applications is to\nverify the satellite or newly developed components\nfor reliable operation in space, which opens the door\nfor use in commercial applications. This so-called\ntechnology demonstration is the declared objective\nof most CubeSat missions.\n\nNot all CubeSats are limited to technology dem-\nonstrations. Many missions incorporate a camera to\nmake images of the Earth. There are also efforts to\nequip CubeSats with instruments to measure rem-\nnants of the atmosphere in space, or to measure\nchanges in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field for clues on how\nto forecast earthquakes. But of course other objectives,\nsuch as communication tests with high data rates,\nrobotic missions, constellation flights and Moon mis-\nsions, can also be imagined.\n\n8.4.2.2 Payload\n\nThe payload is directly correlated with the mission ob-\njective, because it is only possible to reach the mission\nobjective by using the payload successfully. In most\ncases it is an instrument or a sensor which generates\n\n2/24/09 2:50:59 PM\n",
    "719": "CHO8.indd 698\n\n698\n\nessential data for the satellite mission. The very strict\nconstraints regarding mass, volume and power drasti-\ncally limit the choice of available instruments. That\nis why CubeSats have been rarely considered so far\nas an alternative by scientific organizations. Thus,\nthere is a large demand for the miniaturization of\ninstruments.\n\nIf the mission is a pure technology demonstra-\ntion mission, then the component to be tested is the\npayload, which could be a component of a subsystem,\na subsystem or even the satellite itself. In the last case,\nthere is no simple distinction between satellite bus\nand payload.\n\n8.4.2.3 Satellite Bus\n\nTo achieve the mission objective a payload is needed,\nand to operate the payload safely in orbit a satellite\nbus is required. The tasks of the satellite bus are the\nmechanical integration of the payload, data commu-\nnication with the ground station, thermal and attitude\ncontrol of the satellite, and other tasks described in\nthe system design section.\n\n8.4.2.4 Orbit\n\nUp to now only low Earth orbits (LEO, 300-800 km)\nhave been considered suitable for operating Cube-\nSats. There are several reasons: one is that the power\ndemand of the communication subsystem for reliable\ndata transmission increases dramatically with in-\ncreasing orbital height, something which cannot be\nhandled by today\u2019s CubeSats. Moreover, higher orbits\nare more demanding as to radiation load, thermal is-\nsues and power management. Finally, the launch cost\nfor LEO is lower than for higher orbits.\n\nThe mission objective and mission operations\ndetermine the selection of a suitable orbit. A Sun-\nsynchronous orbit, for example, can be very suitable\nregarding the power and thermal subsystem require-\nments and provides a nearly global coverage. On the\nother hand, an equatorial orbit is more suitable for\nattitude stabilization with a permanent magnet since\na more homogeneous magnetic field exists there.\n\n8.4.2.5 Launch vehicle\n\nIn order to reach orbit a suitable launcher is needed.\nIn principle a CubeSat can be launched by any modern\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nlauncher as the vibration test specifications for Cube-\nSats (and thus the qualification for flight) are satisfied\nby virtually all present launchers. However, currently\nthere are not many launches of CubeSats. One reason\nis that the operators of the main payload (mostly\ncommercial satellites) must accept the CubeSat as\na secondary payload. The launch service providers\ntoo must accept a secondary payload, and often it\nis not worth taking the risk. Luckily, two to three\nCubeSat launches a year have taken place, thanks to\nthe efforts of institutes in Canada, the USA and Japan.\nThe former Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles\n(ICBMs) like DNEPR and Rockot are especially suit-\nable for these launches, and there are also efforts to\ndevelop new launchers for small satellites. But in that\ncase the launch costs would again be very high. There\nis another, simpler option for launching CubeSats,\nwhich is direct ejection from the Space Shuttle.\n\n8.4.2.6 Ground Segment\n\nThe ground segment incorporates the terrestrial infra-\nstructure and the personnel necessary to operate the\nsatellite safely. Building up and operating an amateur\nradio ground station is affordable for private persons\nand for universities. Students can operate such a\nground station as well as perform the data analysis.\n\n8.4.3 Requirements\n\nThe main reason for the popularity of CubeSats is\nespecially the standardized interface to the launcher,\nnamely the P-POD (Poly Picosatellite Orbital De-\nployer). Because of the specifications defined in this\nstandard, the satellite is widely decoupled from inte-\ngration in the launcher. This makes it possible to start\nthe development of the satellite before the launcher\nitself is selected and financed. But the CubeSat de-\nveloper then has to fulfill some strict requirements.\nThese include the following for each CubeSat (see\nFigure 8.4.2):\n\ne The structure is a cube with dimensions of 100 x\n100 x 100 mm>.\n\ne Anodized edges with a length of 113.5mm in\ncontact to the P-POD.\n\ne Overall mass less than 1 kg.\n\n2/24/09 2:51:00 PM\n",

Because the missions so far\nare noncommercial and have a pure research back-\nground, requirements for redundancies and extensive\ntests integration are often waived in order to keep the\ndevelopment and test costs low.\n\n8.4.4 System Design and Subsystems\n\nApart from the standard specifications which are\nbinding for CubeSats, each development team is\nfree as to the design of the satellite. In other words,\nCubeSats may look similar from the outside, but inside\neach satellite the individual expertise and different\napproaches of the developers can be found.\n\nBut there is one big commonality among all Cube-\nSats, and that is the use of almost exclusively com-\nmercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components.\nThis is done in order to keep the costs low, because\n\n2/24/09 2:51:00 PM\n",
    "721": "CHO8.indd 700\n\n700\n\nspace-qualified parts are extremely expensive. One\npositive side effect is that these parts often have bet-\nter performance related to mass and power demands\ncompared to their space-qualified counterparts. This\nis because the latter have to be qualified by design\nor tests, which takes a lot of time. In fact, such chips\nare already out of date when they are released on the\nmarket. However, the space branch is very conservative\nand mostly only such parts are used. Thus CubeSats\ncan turn this situation to their advantage by using the\nlatest hardware at the cost of higher risk.\n\nFor the design of a satellite it is useful to build\nthe satellite bus around the payload. This means\nthat the payload and the mission objectives are the\ndesign drivers for the subsystems. The subsystems are\ngenerally divided into the categories described below.\nThe requirements for each of the subsystems can be\nderived directly from the above two criteria.\n\nThe following sections give a short overview of\nthe methodology and technology for realizing each\nsubsystem of a CubeSat. Underlying concepts are\nintroduced and future developments are outlined,\nalthough the discussion is not complete due to the\nlimited framework of this handbook.\n\n8.4.4.1 Attitude Control System\n\nCurrently, either no attitude control or only very basic\nattitude control systems are used in almost all Cube-\nSats. The main reason is that there are basically no\nsuitable actuators and sensors available for CubeSats.\nSensors and actuators which are known from larger\nsatellites are too large, too heavy and need too much\npower to use in CubeSats.\n\nThe simplest form of controlling a CubeSat\u2019s at-\ntitude is to use permanent magnets. This stabilizes the\nattitude of the satellite so that fast rotations can be\navoided. But it is not possible to achieve a controlled\nattitude change with this system. Attitude control\nsystems using magnetic coils as actuators are an\nenhancement. Attitude determination is then often\naccomplished by magnetometers or by using the\nsolar array currents. The expected accuracy of such a\nsystem is very low.\n\nThere are, however, efforts which aim to develop\ncomponents such as picoreaction wheels or minia-\nturized sensors. Figure 8.4.3 shows such a system of\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nFigure 8.4.3: Prototype of a microreaction wheel system for\nCubeSats (Source: TU Berlin).\n\nreaction wheels together with its electronic module.\nThe aim is to achieve an accuracy similar to what\nis possible today with nanosatellites. Once this is\nachieved, it will be possible to have applications for\npicosatellites which require precise attitude control.\nThe complexity of the attitude control system of\na CubeSat (e.g., three-axis stabilization) does not dif-\nfer much from the larger satellites. The requirements\nregarding functionality are the same. Only the require-\nments for redundancy and reliability can be reduced\nin order to remain within the cost frame. On the other\nhand, more than one CubeSat might be built, which\ncould provide redundancy on the system level.\n\n8.4.4.2 Propulsion System\n\nThere are also no specific micropropulsion systems\nsuitable for CubeSats. But two different methods are\nbeing developed: chemical and electrical propulsion.\nCold gas propulsion systems or, for example, systems\nusing hot water vapor belong to the first category.\nThese systems are able to produce significant thrust\nfor a short time in comparison to electrical propulsion\nsystems and are therefore more suitable for CubeSats.\nElectrical propulsion systems use electrons or ions for\nimpulse generation, which provide low but continuous\nthrust levels. With such a propulsion system a reentry\nsystem could be designed which ensures the reentry\nof the satellite after a defined time period. Another\npossibility would be to increase the orbital altitude\n\n2/24/09 2:51:02 PM\n",
    "722": "8.4 System Design Example: CubeSat\n\nby initiating a spiral path which would transport the\nsatellite upward until it reaches a lunar orbit.\n\n8.4.4.3 Communication System\n\nIn order to communicate, the satellite must be able\nto receive telecommands and send data. Because\ncomputer systems communicate using binary data,\nwhereas a radio communication link uses electro-\nmagnetic waves, a number of components must be\nincorporated into the communication system. In the\nfollowing, data transmission from a CubeSat to a\nground station is explained as an example. This discus-\nsion is principally limited to the use of amateur radio\nfrequencies, due to the high complexity and costs as-\nsociated with registering a dedicated frequency.\n\nThe data to be transmitted (e.g., measurements,\nstatus information, etc.) is first formatted on-board\nthe satellite by the board computer, and packetized if\nthere is a large amount of data to be transmitted. The\nAX.25 Protocol is very suitable for this purpose and\nwidely used amongst amateur radio operators. But\nin principle it is possible to use one\u2019s own protocol.\nThen the binary data is modulated by a modem into\na baseband signal of lower frequency. Often the slow\nAFSK 1200bit/s modulation scheme is used, which\ncan be demodulated by many ground stations. For a\nbetter bit error rate it is advisable to use MSK, PSK\nor some other modulation technique with higher bit\nrates. The baseband signal is then modulated onto a\nhigh-frequency carrier signal by the transmitter. This\nis achieved by using FM modulation by commercial\ntransmitters, which are used in CubeSats. Finally, the\nsignal is transmitted into space as an electromagnetic\nwave by the antenna. In general some kind of rod or\npatch antenna can be used for this purpose.\n\nUploading of commands is done in a very similar\nway. The difference is that on Earth the ground sta-\ntion may use much higher power than the satellite\ndoes for transmission. On the other hand, the amount\nof data to be transmitted to the satellite (telecom-\nmands) is a fraction of the data which the satellite\nhas to transmit. In this case it is more important to\nhave a reliable link than a high bit rate. One possible\nsolution is to use DTMF tones for commanding\n(of course again modulated onto a high-frequency\ncarrier signal).\n\nCHO8.indd 701\n\n701\n\nAlmost all CubeSats transmit a beacon signal\nwhich contains the call sign of the satellite and critical\nstatus information. This is often done in Morse code\nutilizing OOK (On-Off Keying), which switches the\ncarrier on and off. The beacon is also used to better\ntrack the satellite.\n\n8.4.4.4 Power System\n\nThe only energy source which can so far be used for\nCubeSats is the conversion of sunlight by solar cells.\nAs the total area on which solar cells can be mounted\nis very small due to the small size of a CubeSat, the\nconversion must be done very efficiently. New de-\nvelopments (multijunction GaAs solar cells) are\npreferred for this reason, although their price is\nmuch higher and they are more difficult to purchase\nthan other options. If the satellite is planned to be\nactive in the Earth\u2019s shadow, which is desirable, for\nexample, when recording system status information,\nthen batteries must also be built into the system. In\nthis case modern lithium-ion accumulators are used\nbecause of their high energy density. An integral part\nof the design of the energy system must be to ensure\nthat the satellite has enough excess energy in the\nsunlight phase (which is used to charge the batter-\nies) to compensate the loss in the shadow phase after\nconsidering all losses in the system.\n\nAnother element in the power system is the condi-\ntioning and distribution of the energy. Using DC/DC\nconverters (upconverters or downconverters) the volt-\nage levels are transformed from the solar cells or bat-\nteries to the levels needed for the power bus systems.\nThe most common voltage levels are 3.3V and 5V as\nthe power supply for electronic circuits. Selected loads\nor complete subsystems can be switched on and off\nby using transistors. This can be done, for example,\nto reset the board computer or to put the satellite in\na power-saving mode.\n\n8.4.4.5 Command and Data Handling System\n\nThe on-board computer is the central unit for pro-\ncessing digital procedures and data on the satellite.\nIn some cases CubeSats can incorporate more than\none computer system to fulfill different specific tasks.\nBut all high-level information is also routed through\n\n2/24/09 2:51:09 PM\n",
    "723": "CHO8.indd 702\n\n702\n\nthe main computer, a microcontroller. The selection\nof a suitable MCU (Micro-Control Unit) is arbitrary\nas there are many modern MCUs and a high number\nof derivatives provided by established manufacturers.\nThe 8051 and HCS12 families of microcontrollers are\nwidely used. It is of course important that the MCU\nhas all the needed interfaces and enough I/O pins. One\nof the interfaces, for example, is the I2C bus interface.\nThis bus system is widely used in entertainment elec-\ntronics but it is also suitable for CubeSats due to its\nsimplicity. With this bus system the controllers can\ncommunicate and also read out other components and\ncontrol them. Besides receiving and executing com-\nmands from the ground station, the board computer\nhas to read and store the necessary data. Temporary\ndata can be kept ina SRAM, while data which have to\nbe stored for longer time periods or large amounts of\ndata are stored in a flash-type memory. This type of\nmemory retains the data even if the power supply is\nswitched off. However, the radiation issues regarding\nflash memory are controversial, so it is a good idea to\nplan suitable means to protect the data (e.g., by using\nerror-correction codes).\n\n8.4.4.6 Thermal System\n\nIn a typical LEO with about 60 minutes of sunlight\nand 30 minutes of shadow a CubeSat is exposed to\nextreme temperature changes. In the shadow the\nsatellite is exposed to almost space background (ap-\nprox. \u2014270\u00b0C), while in the sunlight it is exposed to\none solar constant plus the reflected light from the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere or from the Earth itself (albedo).\nAs a rule of thumb (confirmed by real measurements\nof CubeSats) it is assumed that the temperatures in-\nside the CubeSat will be between \u201420 and +20\u00b0C. But\nwhen the area is directly illuminated by the Sun the\ntemperature is expected to be +80\u00b0C. Although these\ntemperatures are relatively moderate (most of the\nindustrial parts survive these temperatures without\nany problem), for some parts special measures must\nbe taken. This might be a measurement device or the\nbattery, which cannot operate at low temperatures.\nIt is often not enough to use passive elements (paint,\nsurface structure, etc.) to prevent these elements from\nundercooling. In these cases it is mandatory to heat\nthem actively. Heating foils are suitable for applying\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nheat directly. But because such heaters consume a lot\nof energy it is advisable to carefully plan the optimum\nconfiguration and location so that the duration of\nheater operation can be minimized.\n\n8.4.4.7 Structure and Mechanisms\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the outer structure\nis defined by the CubeSat specification. In addition,\nthe specification requires the design of a so-called\n\u201caccess port,\u201d which is used as access to the satellite\nto \u201cremove the before-flight pin,\u201d which enables the\npower system of the satellite. The real challenge in the\ndesign of a CubeSat lies in the design of its mecha-\nnisms. The tight conditions of the outer dimensions\ndo not allow large parts on the outside. External\nparts are allowed to extend only 6mm at maximum\nin order not to touch the P-POD walls. Mechanisms\nsuch as antenna or solar panel deployment must live\nwith this limitation.\n\nBecause of the small size, the inner structure can\nalso be very compressed. It is not enough to shrink\nthe components and then build the satellite in a box-\nlike architecture. It may be necessary to distribute\nfunctions which are normally built into one box\nover the different levels of the satellite. Integration\nand cabling can therefore be demanding challenges\nfrom the construction point of view. The CubeSat\nspecification allows enlargement of a single CubeSat\nto a double or triple unit. This possibility is used to\nget more room for the components and to increase\nthe power capacity.\n\n8.4.5 Model Philosophy\n\nThe development of the final flight model of a Cube-\nSat goes through a series of test models, which become\nmore and more detailed from one project phase to the\nnext. These are functional prototypes, engineering\nmodels, qualification models and finally the flight\nmodel. Because of time and budget restrictions, the\nqualification model and the engineering models\nare often combined, as described in the following.\nCombining an engineering model and a flight model\n(building, testing and flying the engineering model)\nis, however, not advisable since the engineering model\n\n2/24/09 2:51:09 PM\n",
    "724": "8.4 System Design Example: CubeSat\n\nmay comprise many items which have to be revised\nbecause of lack of experience.\n\n8.4.5.1 Prototypes\n\nPrototypes are the first steps to verify the function of\nthe satellite. The aim here is simply to verify the func-\ntion of the design of new parts or assemblies.\n\nIf, for example, a battery which has no space flight\nheritage and is not qualified for space is used, it must\nfirst be tested extensively. In this case the battery would\nbe exposed to vacuum for long time durations and\nmany charge and discharge cycles would be applied\nto it. Then, when the satellite is constructed and all\nsystems integrated, the satellite undergoes extreme\nenvironmental tests in the assembly, integration and\ntest (AIT) phase. For this reason the parts or assem-\nblies must be tested in advance to ensure that they\nwill function later when they are installed in the satel-\nlite. It is extremely important of course to verify not\nonly that the components survive the environmental\nconditions, but also that each system fulfills the task\nit was designed for.\n\nFor this purpose so-called breadboards are built\nfor electrical assemblies. These are supplied with all\nnecessary inputs (power, data, measurements, etc.)\naccording to the black box principle and the outputs\nare monitored. Even circuits developed by IC manu-\nfacturers are recommended to be built up and tested\nusing this method. The prototypes of the different as-\nsemblies (Figure 8.4.4) can be successively integrated\nafterwards to test the functionality on the subsystem\nlevel. The test on the system level then takes place\nduring the AIT phase.\n\n8.4.5.2 Engineering Model\n\nAfter successfully concluding the tests with the proto-\ntype, the results of which are discussed at the critical\ndesign review (CDR), the development continues\nwith the construction of the engineering model\n(EM). All design features and interfaces are frozen\nat this point, which means that no further design\nchange is allowed, unless it is absolutely necessary. As\nmentioned in the introduction, the engineering model\nshould be designed to resemble as closely as possible\nthe functions of the future flight model (FM). For\n\nCHO8.indd 703\n\n703\n\nFigure 8.4.4: Magnetometer at the prototype level (COMPASS-1)\n(Source: FH Aachen).\n\nthis purpose the EM must have the mechanical and\nelectrical properties of the later flight model.\n\n8.4.5.3 Flight Model\n\nIn the ideal case the engineering model would be suit-\nable as a flight model. But normally small differences\narise, especially during the qualification tests in order\nto correct minor issues. The test requirements are\ntreated in the AIT section. At this point it should be\nmentioned that after finishing the EM tests, the flight\nmodel can be constructed. Before that there is a quali-\nfication review (QR) in which the eventually necessary\nchanges for the FM are analyzed and defined.\n\nThe model philosophy of the BeeSat picosatellites,\nfor example, includes the following models.\n\nThe structure model (SM) is used not only for the\ntests mentioned in Table 8.4.1, but also for the veri-\nfication of the cabling and integration concept. The\nradio link test model (RTM) is used to measure the\nantenna characteristics in conjunction with the actual\nstructural properties of the satellite. This is important\ndue to the fact that the satellite is very small and strong\ninteractions between the structure and the antenna\ncharacteristics can be expected. The combined engi-\nneering and qualification model (EQM) goes through\nall qualification tests. The results can be used to correct\nany faults for the flight model. If necessary, the EQM\nis further used at the laboratory for diagnostics after\nthe launch of the satellite into orbit.\n\n2/24/09 2:51:10 PM\n",

In this\nphase it must be shown not only that each assembly\nand subsystem does work properly, but that all parts\nare working together. All previously defined interfaces\nmust be tested extensively in order to detect and cor-\nrect possible failures (e.g., endless loops in software).\nThe mission should be simulated with all relevant\naspects such as sending telecommands and receiving\ndata, because, although everything may be modeled\nvery carefully, some errors can only be detected in the\nfully integrated system.\n\n8.4.6.1 Integration\n\nWhen the development and construction of all as-\nsemblies and subsystems is completed, they must be\nintegrated. It is very helpful to write a procedure in\nadvance which shows the integration steps one by one.\nACAD model can be used for this procedure but real\nconditions, for example the accessibility of screws or\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nthe sequence of integration, should be kept in mind\nas well. The integration itself should take place under\nclean-room conditions as far as possible. Compared to\nlarger satellites, where several weeks must be planned\nfor the integration process, it takes only a few hours for\nCubeSats, provided that it is well organized in advance.\nIt is also very useful to extensively document the in-\ntegration process with photos. After integration the\nsatellite can be accessed via the access port (or via the\nradio communication link) in order to receive mea-\nsurement data or to check specific system functions.\nWhen it has been ensured that all systems are working\nproperly, the environmental tests can start.\n\nThe aim of these tests, which are described in\nthe following, is the qualification of the satellite for\nthe launcher (whereby it should be ensured that the\nsatellite does not endanger other payloads on-board\nthe launcher and can safely reach the orbit) and to\nensure that the satellite will survive the extreme orbital\nconditions.\n\n8.4.6.2 Vibration Tests\n\nThe first group of tests is vibration tests, where the\nmechanical loads which are induced on the satellite\nduring launch are simulated. Due to the fact that in\nmany cases there is no signed launch contract during\nthe development phase of the CubeSat (in many cases\nthe launch negotiations are started after the qualifica-\ntion review), these tests should be organized in sucha\nway that a variety of launchers can be considered. As\nan example, the test profile for the NSL-4 launch used\nby the University of Toronto is given in Figure 8.4.5. To\nmake the simulation as realistic as possible the Cube-\nSat is built into a test-POD (similar to the P-POD),\nwhich is then mounted on the vibration table. For all\nthree axes the random profiles are executed, whereby\nthe levels for the EQM are increased by a factor of 1.5\ncompared to the FM. Sine tests are done before and\nafter each test, which can give additional information\non structural changes of the satellite.\n\n8.4.6.3 Thermal Vacuum Tests\n\nWith the thermal vacuum tests the conditions in\norbit are simulated as realistically as possible. These\ntests can be very expensive as a number of environ-\nmental conditions must be simulated correctly. This\n\n2/24/09 2:51:15 PM\n",

It must be adjusted to a level where the\nCubeSat is irradiated with one solar constant. The\ncold space background is simulated by cooled black\nwalls. In addition, vacuum must be generated of\ncourse. The small size of a CubeSat is advantageous\nin this case. A vacuum chamber and a xenon light\nsource lamp suitable for this size are affordable. The\ncold background requires more effort. It is, however,\npossible to design the thermal analysis in such a way\nthat it can be decoupled from the test. If the \u201cspace\nbackground\u201d is at room temperature level, then it\ncan be incorporated in the thermal analysis. Accurate\ntemperature predictions can be made afterwards by\ncalculating the conditions in orbit. Another possible\nway to test the temperature behavior of the satel-\nlite is to use thermal ovens. Such thermal ovens are\nable to provide temperature cycles from degrees below\nfreezing to high temperatures under atmospheric\nconditions and can be used to expose the CubeSat to\nextreme temperature cycles.\n\n8.4.7 Operations Aspects and Ground\nSegment\n\nThe operation of a CubeSat does not principally dif-\nfer from the operation of a larger satellite. All known\n\nCHO8.indd 705\n\n705\n\nFigure 8.4.6: Mission control center of TU Berlin (Source:\nTU Berlin).\n\naspects of larger satellite operations must be consid-\nered for CubeSats as well. All elements of mission\nplanning and mission operations must be involved.\n\nOne important aspect of mission planning is the\nvisibility prediction of the satellite from the ground\nstation. In the case of CubeSat projects it is common\ntoday to use suitable freeware or shareware software\ntools. These programs need so-called two-line ele-\nments (TLE) as input to calculate the orbit of the\nsatellite. TLEs are orbital parameters of satellites and\nother objects in Earth orbit. These elements are pro-\nvided by the US NORAD ina two-line test format. The\naccuracy of the elements is good enough for ground\nstation antenna tracking. Having the access times to\nground stations or other points on Earth makes it pos-\nsible to determine the switch-on times of cameras or\ntransmitters, for example. The planning itself is mostly\ndone by simple means such as using tables.\n\nMission operations can be performed by one or\nmore ground stations connected to a mission control\ncenter (see Figure 8.4.6). In the simplest case the\nground station can be used for all tasks, including\nplanning and mission operations.\n\nFor the ground station, equipment which has\nbeen proven to be useful for an amateur radio via a\nsatellite is employed in most cases. A typical set of\nequipment includes:\n\nYagi antenna\ne Amplifier for transmission and reception\ne Lightning protection\ne Antenna rotor\n\n2/24/09 2:51:16 PM\n",
    "727": "CHO8.indd 706\n\n706\n\ne Antenna control electronics\n\ne Computer for antenna steering, including orbital\ntracking software\n\ne Transceiver for UHF/VHF bands\n\ne Terminal node controller (TNC)\n\ne Computer for data reception and transmission of\ntelecommands.\n\nIn most cases the AX.25 Protocol is used for the data\ntransmission. The big advantage of this protocol\nis that it is widely used by amateur radio stations, so\nthat there are a lot of hardware and software tools\navailable which can be used. The connection between\ntransceiver and computer is realized by the TNC. It\nincludes a modem, which is connected to a microcon-\ntroller which takes care of the time-critical functions\nof the communication. The cost of such a ground\nstation is in the order of several thousand euros, which\nmakes it affordable especially for universities.\n\nBibliography\n[8.4.1]  CubeSat Design Specification, Revision B.

Above all, they can be divided into conven-\ntional satellites and small satellites. Small satellites\ncan be divided with reference to their mass into\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nmicro-, nano- and picosatellites. There is no uni-\nfied international definition, but the classification\nin Table 8.5.1 is common.\n\nThe first satellite, Sputnik 1, was a small satellite\nin this sense. But the next satellites became much\nbigger and the launcher capacity much larger. Today\nmany highly complex satellites are in space. Advanced\ntechnologies allow these missions to be supplemented\nby small satellite missions. New technologies are\nverified in space by small satellite missions. With the\nexperiences gained, they can be further developed\nfor large satellites. The advantages of small satellite\nmissions are:\n\ne Low budget\n\ne Short mission implementation time\n\ne Dedicated mission objectives\n\ne Small user communities\n\ne Possible implementation of advanced technologies\nwithout space flight qualification.\n\nSmall satellite missions have to fulfill high perfor-\nmance requirements under difficult conditions: low\nmass, low volume, low power consumption, low fi-\nnancial budget. The cost aspect is the most important\ndriver for small satellite missions. Usually the main\npart of the cost of such missions is for the spacecraft\nitself. The launch costs are about 20-50% of the total\nmission cost and the costs for the ground segment and\nmission operations are in the order of 15% [8.5.1].\nIn the satellite classification no sharp limits exist\nrelating to the mass. Even a 120kg satellite can be\ncalled a microsatellite. A very important feature of\nthe class of microsatellites is the piggyback launch\nstrategy. This means that the microsatellite can\nbe launched as a secondary payload. That is one\nof the main differences to minisatellites, which re-\nquire a more expensive shared launch or a dedicated\n\nTable 8.5.1: Satellite classification by total mass.\n\nSatellite class\n\nConventional satellite > 500kg\nMinisatellite 100-500 kg\nMicrosatellite 10-100 kg\nNanosatellite 1-10kg\nPicosatellite 0.1-1kg\n\n2/24/09 2:51:34 PM\n",

But also the launch strategy is not fixed.\nFor instance, the nanosatellites of TU Berlin (TUB-\nSAT-N) are launched into orbit with a dedicated\nsubmarine rocket, and a few microsatellites have also\nbeen launched with a dedicated launcher developed\nin-house.\n\nThe application of the design-to-cost philosophy\nis typical of microsatellite missions since costs are\nsuch an essential factor. Cost overruns in microsatel-\nlite missions lead to the danger of termination of the\ncomplete mission even before it begins. This is also\na very special feature of microsatellite missions in\ncontrast to larger missions.\n\nIn the following the typical system design of a\nsmall satellite mission is described using the BIRD\nmicrosatellite mission of the German Aerospace Cen-\nter (DLR) as an example. BIRD was launched success-\nfully into low Earth orbit in 2001.\n\n8.5.2 Design and Mission Elements\nof BIRD\n\n8.5.2.1 Motivation and Mission Objectives\n\nFire has an increasing impact on the Earth\u2019s\necosystem. It influences the chemistry of the atmos-\nphere, the greenhouse effect (because of carbon-\ncontaining aerosol emissions) and contributes to\nclimate change. The need for precise data on the\nintensity and surface extent of vegetation fires and\nvolcanic activities is increasing worldwide. Such data\nis important for the detection and management of\ndisasters and for a better understanding of the im-\npact of fires and volcanic activities on the climate.\nTheir influence has not been investigated sufficiently\nup to now because of the lack of measurement data\non a global scale.\n\nFor hotspot events such as forest and vegetation\nfires, volcanic activity or burning oil wells and coal\nseams, dedicated space instrumentation does not exist.\nAnew generation of cooled infrared sensor arrays will\nplay an important role for future Earth observation\nmissions. For the measurement of temperature, area\nextent and intensity of fires and volcanic activities\nfrom space at least two infrared imaging sensors\ninterfering with each other are needed, preferably in\n\nc08.indd 707\n\n707\n\nthe wavelength range of 4-10 um. The infrared sensor\nsystem should not be saturated at fire temperatures up\nto 1000 \u00b0C. The temperature of the \u201ccool\u201d environment\nof the fire areas should be measured with a resolution\nof approx. 0.5K.\n\nThe BIRD (Bispectral Infrared Detection) mis-\nsion is a small satellite mission with technological\nand scientific-methodological objectives, answer-\ning a number of questions related to the evaluation\nand operation of cooled infrared sensors in space.\nAnother primary mission objective is the investigation\nof vegetation fires from space by means of this new\ninfrared technology. Innovative operational concepts\nand new methods of data acquisition for hotspots\nare demonstrated by this mission. The objectives are\nsummarized in Section 8.1.4.\n\n8.5.2.2 Mission Concept\n\nThe BIRD mission is funded and implemented by\nDLR. Small and medium-sized enterprises and na-\ntional research organizations like the Fraunhofer\nGesellschaft are contributing their own funding to\nthe success of the mission. Strict cost limits, very chal-\nlenging mission objectives and the implementation of\nadvanced technologies also led to new approaches in\nthe mission program segment. The use of advanced\ntechnologies applying the design-to-cost philosophy\nwas feasible only by keeping the cost of parts and\nequipment low, which meant the general abandon-\nment of so-called \u201chigh-reliability\u201d space-qualified\nparts. To reduce the resulting higher risk, the following\nmeasures were taken:\n\ne Designing for overloads and smart degradation,\nwhen operating with underperforming satellite\nsubsystems (derating parts and equipment).\n\ne Extensive redundancy conception.\n\ne A tailored hybrid model philosophy on the system\nlevel (2% model philosophy: STM > EM, FM).\n\ne A tailored quality management system according\nto ISO 9000 and successive standards, ECSS, DLR-\nQMS, including an audit and alert system, docu-\nmented assembly and integration, among other\nmeasures.\n\ne A risk management system, that is risk analysis\nand risk evaluation according to MIL-STD-882D\nand ECSS.\n\n2/27/09 1:32:46 PM\n",
    "729": "CHO8.indd 708\n\n708\n\nFor the design lifetime of one year the selection\nof the electrical, electronic and electromechanical\n(EEE) parts followed a mixed strategy. In general, all\nparts used for the satellite implementation have the\n\u201cindustrial-type\u201d or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)\nquality level, except for components that were identi-\nfied as weak points from the reliability point of view\nby special analysis (like FMECA etc.). In these cases\nparts qualified according to MIL specifications were\nused. Using this approach the space segment costs and\nthe risk for the one-year design lifetime could be kept\nlow. The BIRD mission was developed, built, tested\nand placed into orbit within five years for a total cost\nof about 15 million euros. The designed lifetime of\none year has been exceeded by several years of suc-\ncessful operation.\n\n8.5.2.3 The Launch Element\n\nIn accordance with the design-to-cost philosophy the\nsatellite was planned for launch as a secondary pay-\nload. This required the satellite design to be suitable\nfor different LEO orbits and adaptable to different\nlauncher requirements. Even though the payload with\nthe cooled infrared sensors had high power consump-\ntion, the spacecraft had to be small and light. The\nmicrosatellite had to be compatible with the launch\nadapters of different launchers like Kosmos, Dnepr,\nZenit, PSLV, Ariane and others. The dimensions of the\nsatellite had to be less than 500 x 500 x 800 mm3 and\nthe total mass less than 100 kg. Keeping the footprint\nof the satellite within the required dimensions was\nusually more important than maintaining the orbital\naltitude of the satellite, within limits. Another impor-\ntant launch requirement was easy mechanical adapta-\ntion to different launch platforms from the design and\nconstruction points of view. The qualification of the\nsatellite including the adapter plates, if applicable, had\nto apply to different launchers.\n\n8.5.2.4 Orbit and Constellation\n\nThe objectives of the BIRD mission can be achieved\nby one single satellite in a low Earth orbit. According\nto the design-to-cost philosophy, it is not possible\nto define the orbit yielding the maximum scientific\noutput or best operational performance. But it was\nimportant to define the crucial orbit parameters and\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nlimits in order to identify one or more launch options\n\nin the planned launch year of 2001. The primary orbit\n\nparameters for a nearly circular orbit are the average\naltitude and the inclination of the orbit. For the BIRD\nmission, orbit altitude is determined by:\n\ne The design lifetime in orbit and the descent rate\ndue to atmospheric drag (lower limit of alti-\ntude)\n\ne The required geometric and radiometric resoluti-\non in combination with the optics design (upper\nlimit of altitude).\n\nAlso, the following limits of a nearly circular orbit\nwere defined:\n\ne Desired orbit altitude: 450-650 km\n\ne Maximum orbit altitude: 850 km.\n\nThe inclination influences different important mis-\nsion parameters like area and time coverage, repeat\ntime, illumination conditions of the target (local\ntime), regression of the ascending node, ground sta-\ntion contacts and other factors. For the BIRD mission\na fixed orbit inclination was not required.\n\nThe upper limit of inclination is the desired Sun-\nsynchronous inclination and the lower limit is de-\ntermined by the requirement to cover the German\nground segment. The required orbit inclination i is\n\ndefined as\n53\u00b0 <i< 99\u00b0,\n\nAll other orbit parameters (for instance, equatorial\ncrossing time, right ascension of the ascending node,\neccentricity, etc.) cannot be defined by a secondary\npayload passenger.\n\n8.5.2.5 The Space Element\n\nThe BIRD microsatellite is the space element of the\nmission. It consists of the payload and the space-\ncraft bus. Some basic parameters are summarized in\nTable 8.5.2.\n\nThe payload of the space element results from the\ngeometric, radiometric, spectral and other require-\nments derived from the mission objectives. Some\nbasic requirements are summarized in Table 8.1.1\nin Section 8.1.4. The main equipment of the BIRD\npayload consists of:\n\n2/24/09 2:51:35 PM\n",

Several requirements\nfor the spacecraft bus result from the payload, the\noperational concept and the sensor system param-\neters. The BIRD satellite design is characterized\nby a compact architecture consisting of three seg-\nments: the payload segment, the electronics segment\nand the service segment.

As mentioned above, the pay-\nload segment contains the exchangeable payload\nplatform with the instrumentation. The term compact\nsatellite expresses the high integration density of\nall equipment and components within the primary\nstructure, independent of their subsystem assignment.\nThis is a very common architecture for microsatellites.\nIn contrast to the compact architecture, a satellite can\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nFigure 8.5.1: BIRD satellite bus as a compact satellite with cubic\nshape, consisting of three segments: exchangeable payload segment\n(free space), electronics segment (red), service segment (yellow\nbody) (Source: DLR).\n\nbe designed in a box architecture characterized by an\narrangement of satellite equipment in functional box\nunits, for instance an electronics box, a telemetry box,\na payload data handling box, and so on.\n\nThe BIRD satellite bus includes several advanced\ntechnologies that are space flight proven with this\nmission.

To reduce\nthe technical risk connected with new developments,\nthe following measures were adopted:\n\ne Extensive development tests and qualification tests\non the equipment level\n\ne Redundant implementation of all critical units\nor equipment.\n\nRedundancy can also be functional redundancy. For\ninstance, the two star sensors and the gyroscope\nestablish a 2-of-3 redundant attitude sensor system.\nThe three-axis magnetometer supplements this\nredundant system as a solution for a further emer-\ngency case, but with very limited performance. The\nprecision reaction wheels are implemented as a hot\nredundant system: although three reaction wheels\nare enough for the required precision, BIRD has four\nreaction wheels running in the nominal case. The\nmagnetic coils for the desaturation of the reaction\nwheels are implemented in cold redundancy. In an\nemergency attitude control can be accomplished by\nmagnetic coils as the only actuators, but with a very\nlimited performance and only to a certain extent.\nThe navigation package contains an on-board orbit\npropagator developed by DLR-GSOC and fitted by\nmeasurement points from the GPS receiver. If the GPS\nreceiver fails, the supporting points for orbit calcula-\ntion can be uploaded from the ground. Of course, the\npositional accuracy is decreased.\n\nThe attitude control software runs on the space-\ncraft bus computer (= board computer), which is\nconnected to a second computer in a master-slave\nconfiguration.

That means the satellite can take image data\nfrom any point on the Earth, store it and then dump\nthe data down on the next pass over the German\nground station. Simultaneous image acquisition and\nownlinking over Europe is also possible. Figure 8.1.2\nin Section 8.1 shows the mission architecture, inclu-\ning the communication architecture. Command of\nthe satellite is carried out exclusively by DLR-GSOC,\nwith the mission control center at Oberpfaffenhofen\nand the ground station at Weilheim.

    "734": "8.5 Exemplary System Design of a Microsatellite Mission\n\nMission operations for the BIRD satellite are\ncomplex because of the number of limitations. The\nsatellite cannot measure continuously with all in-\nstruments but for 10 minutes in one orbit only and\nalso not in each orbit. The reason is the unusual\n(for microsatellites) high peak power consump-\ntion of 200W in the Earth observation mode with\nsimultaneous data dumps. Generally microsatellites\ngenerate an average power of 20-60W. But BIRD\nis an experimental satellite without a continuous\nduty cycle, so the measurement time is limited to\n10 min. The associated swath length on the ground\nof approx. 4000km is completely sufficient for\nexperimental purposes. The energy for the 20 min\ncooling-down time and 10 min measurement time\nis taken primarily from the batteries. After this\nperiod the spacecraft slews itself so that the solar\narrays point perpendicular to the Sun to recharge\nthe batteries. The operational modes of the satel-\nlite are depicted in Figure 8.5.4. The basic mode is\nthe Sun-pointing fixed mode (SPF in Figure 8.5.4)\nwith the solar arrays perpendicular to the Sun vector\nand the satellite moving inertially fixed. The same at-\ntitude is assumed by the satellite in safe mode and in\nthe auto-acquisition mode (AAM), with the satellite\ndetecting the Sun autonomously and aligning the so-\nlar arrays. The roughly nadir-pointing direction of the\npayload segments and the high-gain antenna are used\nfor ground contact and high data rate transmission.\n\nFigure 8.5.4: Satellite modes of BIRD: AAM, Auto-Acquisition Mode;\nDAM, Damping Mode; LAM, Large-Angle Maneuver; SPF, Sun-Pointing\nFix; SPR, Sun-Pointing Rotate; EPM, Earth-Pointing Mode; IPG,\nInertial Pointing Mode; SPM, Suspend Mode.\n\nc08.indd 713\n\n713\n\nThe Earth-pointing mode (EPM) requires precise\npointing accuracy, as described in Table 8.5.5. Be-\nsides these main operational modes, the satellite\ncan carry out an on-board data processing task as a\ntechnological experiment. The processing results are\nhigh-level data products of the type so far produced\nonly on the ground. Earth observation images can be\nrecorded during nighttime, too.

In the suspend mode\n(SPM) almost all attitude control equipment is\nswitched off.\n\n8.5.2.9 Data Processing, Archiving and\nDistribution\n\nThe processing, archiving and distribution of BIRD\n\npayload data are accomplished immediately after re-\n\nception by the DLR ground station at Neustrelitz.

The next step is the assembly of the secondary\nstructure, namely the three solar arrays. For system\nintegration a clean room of class 200 000 is sufficient,\nbecause no dust-sensitive surfaces are endangered.\nNevertheless, a common clean-room regime is kept,\nlike the wearing of special clothes, and access and\nbehavior regulations. But costly and technically\nelaborate forced air circulation and cleaning is not\nused.\n\nA crucial point to comply with fixed cost limita-\ntions is the selection of the model philosophy. For the\nBIRD space element a hybrid model philosophy was\ndefined to meet the requirements for a high-quality-\nlevel spacecraft under the condition of making exten-\nsive use of innovative solutions. On the equipment\nlevel, there are different technology maturity levels\nand corresponding individual model philosophies.\nThe (preliminary) status of the BIRD model phi-\nlosophy as of January 28, 2000 was defined in the\n\u201chardware matrix\u201d document as shown in Table 8.5.7\nas an example [8.5.3]\n\nAccording to the hybrid model philosophy, the\nfollowing models were built on the system level.\n\nMass Model\n\nThe mass model (MM) was built for the qualification\nof a separation system developed in-house but not\nused later.

It is used to test\nand verify all essential electrical, electronic and elec-\ntromechanical functions and the proper functioning\nof the interaction between hardware and software.\nIn order to build a model with an arrangement of\nall units according to the flight configuration, the\nstructural elements of the STM are used to build the\nengineering model (see Figure 8.5.6).

The latter feature enables space\nvehicles to determine easily and precisely their own\norbital positions and instantaneous attitude by using\nthree antennas located on the edges of the vehicle\u2019s\nstructure.\n\nThe complete Galileo system comprises 27\nactive satellites of which nine plus one additional\nspare satellite travel in three different orbital planes,\neach inclined by 56\u00b0 to the equatorial plane. The\nascending nodes (right ascension of the ascending\nnode (RAAN)) of each of the three planes are sepa-\nrated by 120\u00b0, leading to the best possible equal dis-\ntribution of spacecraft around the globe. The spare\nsatellite in each orbital plane is in \u201chot standby\u201d\nmode with only the radiofrequency (RF) power stages\nswitched off. It can replace a faulty satellite within\na few hours or days depending on the position of\nthe defective satellite. At an orbital altitude of about\n23620km above the Earth, the satellites travel in a\nsometimes-called medium Earth orbit (MEO) in a\nzone which imposes particularly high doses of space\nradiation on the satellites. The Galileo constellation\nwill enable a global accuracy of 4m laterally (20 value)\nand 8 m vertically (26 value) without regional or local\naugmentation support for more than 95% of the time.\nA sophisticated terrestrial performance measurement\nnetwork consisting of more than 30 sensor stations\ndetermines for safety-critical navigation users (e.g.,\naviation) the so-called \u201cintegrity\u201d of the instanta-\nneously achievable accuracy. Galileo safety-of-life\nreceivers on-board aviation vehicles will receive an\nintegrity warning message within 6s of the detection\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nof conditions exceeding a specified threshold, for\nexample, 20m vertically and 12 m laterally.\n\nInaddition to the position\u2014navigation\u2014time (PNT)\nservices with and without integrity information, the\nsystem also provides a global data dissemination\nservice, the so-called commercial service (CS). The CS\ntransmits navigation-related encrypted information\nwith a net bit rate of 500 bit/s. Furthermore, there is a\nspecial payload dedicated to permanently monitoring\nthe international distress call frequency on 406 MHz\nfor calls originating from aviation and maritime\nsearch and rescue (SAR) distress beacons. This pay-\nload operates within the framework of intergovern-\nmental COSPAS-SARSAT agreements. Galileo SAR\nsupport not only enables active acknowledgment of a\nreceived distress call through a return channel, but also\nperforms active localization by the radio triangulation\nof legacy beacons without integrated RNSS receivers.\nAll Galileo satellites in the in-orbit validation (IOV)\nand full deployment (FOC) phases are designed for an\nin-orbit lifetime of 12 years. Although this complies\nwith the state of the art of telecommunications satel-\nlites, it represents a major challenge for the long-term\noperation of on-board (ultrastable oscillators) atomic\nclocks on navigation satellites. All navigation signals\nand RF link parameters are designed to be compatible\nwith the transmissions of other RNSS systems. The\nunrestricted signals of the Galileo OS (Open Service)\nand SoL (Safety-of-Life) services are also designed to\nbe interoperable with the co-frequency signals of the\nUS GPS system. This means that dual-system receivers\ncan constructively process the signals of both systems\ninto a valid navigation and time solution. Figure 8.6.1\nshows the navigation signals E5, E6 and E1 transmit-\nted permanently from each of the Galileo satellites in\nthe respective RNSS-allocated frequency bands with\ncorresponding bandwidths. Note that the E1 signal\nwas called L1 in earlier program phases, creating\nconfusion with the GPS-L1 since the signal structure\nin Galileo differs significantly from the GPS-L1.\n\nEach transmitted signal consists of a complex\nmultiplex of in-phase and quadrature phase signal\ncomponents carrying two I and Q (E5) and three\nA, B and C (E6, El) orthogonal channels. All signals\nhave a so-called pilot channel in common, intention-\nally carrying no data messages and thus optimizing\nsolely the ranging performance, in particular under\n\n2/24/09 2:51:46 PM\n",

This results in up to 10 signal components\nbeing processed in user terminals either as stand-\nalone or in any reasonable signal combination. This\nmakes possible a wide variety of low-cost to high-end\nuser receivers for a wide range of target groups and\napplications. For instance, the use of dual-frequency\nreceivers can increase the timely availability of a high\naccuracy of less than 1 m because it allows the receiver\nto calculate a sophisticated ionospheric model to\ncompensate for the impact of the variance in the signal\narrival time due to varying propagation conditions\nin the ionosphere.\n\nThe fine structures of the signals are optimized\nto meet the demands of the three main target user\ngroups. These are:\n\ne Private and commercial users\n\ne Safety of Life (SoL) users in the aeronautical,\nrailway and maritime safety-critical areas\n\ne Governmental and security-sensitive user groups\n(public regulated service).\n\n8.6.2 Design Driver and Design\nProcess\nAll design requirements represent the results of many\n\ncomprehensive and dedicated studies aggregated in\na requirements database from which all interface,\n\nCHO8.indd 719\n\nsubsystem and equipment specifications are derived\nand defined. The set of specifications forms the basis\nfor the entire development and flight qualification\nprocess of the Galileo satellites. Each satellite contains\na support module, also called the satellite bus or\nplatform, and a payload module specifically tailored\nto the Galileo mission. The specific requirements for\nthe payload largely drive the framework conditions\nfor the satellite design, such as the accommodation\nof \u201ccold\u201d and \u201chot\u201d equipment, their power supply, as\nwell as the RF cable connections to the antenna farm.\nThis in turn drives the dimensioning of the payload-\nsupporting subsystems, particularly the power supply\ndesigned for the specified end-of-life performance\nafter 12 years, and the thermal subsystem that drives\nthe satellite volume and mass.\n\nThe total number of flight units for the Galileo\nsystem represents a large number, 30 plus ground\nspares for a space business accustomed to producing\nlarge satellites mostly in single units. In principle,\nsatellite navigation systems can only provide good 3D\npositioning if at least four satellites with large angu-\nlar separation are in view of an observer\u2019s position.\nDesign changes or new features only become perceiv-\nable when all the satellites of a constellation provide\nthe same degree of service. Thus, the large number\nand the fact that all satellites have to be identical to\nprovide equal performance lead to the exact duplica-\ntion of satellites regarding design, performance and\n\n2/25/09 2:26:18 PM\n",

With higher\nquantities of satellites, it becomes more important to\nconsider an optimized design for manufacturing to\nachieve cost advantages during satellite production\nand testing. An impression of a \u201cready to fly\u201d Galileo\nsatellite with a view of its Earth-pointing antenna farm\nis shown in Figure 8.6.2. To ensure consistent orienta-\ntion during design, development and documentation,\nan orthogonal (Cartesian) coordinate system has\nbeen defined with the reference point in one corner of\nthe satellite, as shown in Figure 8.6.3. This coordinate\ndefinition yields a positive number for each reference\nto panel positions, interfaces or any other point on\nthe spacecraft. Furthermore, the origin of the coordi-\nnate system is located at a point with good accessibility\non the surface of the spacecraft. It exists physically at\navery early stage of the integration process, providing\nclear references for all follow-up alignments during\nintegration. The positive x-axis of the Galileo satellites\npoints in the flight direction while the positive z-axis\npoints toward the center of the Earth to optimize the\ndirection of the boresight gain of the main mission\nantenna toward the Earth, and the solar arrays turn\naround the y-axis to maintain Sun pointing.

With the\nz-axis pointing of the main mission antenna toward\nthe center of the Earth (nadir pointing), the antenna\nprovides a nearly constant power flux density on\nthe visible surface of the Earth because of its isoflux\ncharacteristic. This special characteristic assures that\nmore RF power is radiated effectively toward the edge\nof coverage rather than to the subsatellite point.\n\n2/25/09 2:26:19 PM\n",
    "742": "8.6 Galileo Satellites\n\nConnected to the y-walls are two solar arrays\neach providing 850 W of end-of-life DC power; the\nrotation around the y-axis maintains a Sun-pointing\nmode controlled by the on-board computer (inte-\ngrated control and data unit). During the relatively\nong launch implementation process of direct injec-\ntion into the final orbit, the solar arrays are folded\ninto the y-walls and do not produce any power. As\nsoon as the solar arrays are deployed, the y-walls of-\ner further capacity for heat dissipation into space.\nDissipation areas (panels/walls) toward cold space are\ney elements for sustaining a comfortable operating\ntemperature inside the satellites since high-power\ndevices can generate considerable amounts of heat.\nBecause the vacuum in space prevents the transporta-\ntion of heat through convection, any source of heat\nis thermally connected to heat-conducting surfaces\nand/or heat pipes. The right mix of active and pas-\nsive thermal elements ensures balanced thermal\nconditions under all specified satellite operating\nconditions. The attitude and orbit control subsystem\nmaintains the three-axis stabilization by orientation\nof the Earth- (z) and Sun-pointing (y) axes based\non real-time information provided by appropriately\nmounted Sun and Earth sensors. Intentional changes\nof attitude as well as compensations for orbital dis-\nturbances can be performed by monopropellant\nthrusters, momentum wheels and magnetic torque\nrods that are geometrically mounted such that the on-\nboard computer can command any required attitude.\nThese control processes can be either commanded\nthrough ground control or performed autonomously.\nIn summary, it can be concluded that the main design\ndrivers are:\n\n1. The primary power required at the end-of-life of\nthe spacecraft.\n\n2. The launch mass at the beginning of a mission,\nincluding fuel for all maneuvers throughout the\nsatellite\u2019s lifetime until final transfer to a graveyard\norbit.\n\n3. The overall volume of the satellite with solar ar-\nrays stowed.\n\nThe fairing geometries of the four launch systems that\nare to be considered as launch alternatives particularly\nconcern the last criterion listed above. The potential\nlaunch systems are:\n\nCHO8.indd 721\n\n721\n\n1. The European Ariane 5, which can inject at least\nfour satellites directly into their final orbital\npositions.\n\n2.

The Russian Proton.\n\nBesides rapid implementation of the initial constella-\ntion, it is important to have a cost-efficient system for\nsingle satellite replacements. Another important issue\nof satellite design is the process of starting from the\noverall required reliability of the entire satellite to per-\nform as specified to derive the reliability contributions\nfrom subsystems and components and respect them\nin optimized strategies for the implementation of\nappropriate system redundancies. This is usually per-\nformed in quantitative analyses, albeit taking into con-\nsideration that the necessary large number of events\nwhich are mandatory to determine the underlying\nstatistical effects are not sufficiently available. As a\nresult, the high power amplification chain for the El\nsignal, for example, comprises three solid-state power\namplifiers (SSPAs) of which only two are active while\nthe third is engaged only when one of them fails. The\nsatellite system block in Figure 8.6.5 below shows\nseveral other examples for redundancies. Further\nredundancies are used on the equipment and circuit\nlevels as appropriate.\n\n8.6.3 Platform and Subsystems\n\n8.6.3.1 Structure and Thermal Management\n\nThe carrier of all components i.e. the physical structure\nhas to mitigate elegantly the contradicting require-\nments of light weight (low mass), high form stability,\nand high thermal and electrical conductivity of all\nsatellite components.

The structure of the Galileo satellites\nconsists of a metal-laminated cuboid honeycomb\nstructure with dimensions 2.50 x 1.20 x 1.10m\u2019, At\nlaunch with a full tank of 100 liters, the satellite\u2019s wet\nmass is about 700kg at maximum. Integrated sup-\nporting elements at critical structure positions absorb\nexcessive loads as can occur in the solar array drive\nmechanisms and the launcher interface. Metal string-\ners (titanium\u2014aluminum\u2014vanadium) with very low\nthermal conductivity ensure a thermally isolated area\nfor the clocks, which include those meeting rubidium\natomic frequency standards (RAFS) and superstable\npassive hydrogen masers (PHMs). Each of the walls\nserves a special purpose. For instance, the components\nof the propulsion system are mounted on the x-wall,\nwhile the inner wall carries four momentum wheels\nwhich are symmetrically mounted around the center\nof gravity, as shown in Figure 8.6.3. By means of the\nmomentum wheels, the on-board computer can turn\nthe satellite into any desired attitude. The \u2014z-side,\nlater facing permanently toward outer space as well\nas toward the launcher dispenser interface, as shown\nin Figure 8.6.4, forms the bottom plate of the satellite\ncomprising three segments that offer access to the com-\npartments housing platform avionics, the propulsion\ntank and most of the internal payload equipment.\nPhysical extensions of the radiation area of both\n+y-panel surfaces of about 15cm ensure a ther-\nmal balance, especially for the high dissipation heat\ncontributed by the high-power SSPAs.

Other measures\nto support appropriate thermal management are\npainting the equipment\u2019s surface black or keeping the\nopen metallic surface depending on whether it acts as\na heat sink or source of heat dissipation. Thermally\nrepresentative satellite models are investigated by\ncomputer simulations (CATIA\u2019) to determine the\nthermal performance of the equipment under all\noperating conditions; for example, when exposed to\nsolar heat conditions, or during cool-down during\neclipses. Payload and platform modules are designed\nas stand-alone units to enable separate pre-integra-\ntion and functional verification, with both modules\nmated at a later stage in the production process. Be-\nsides providing the advantage of easy access to both\nmodules during integration, this means that they can\nalso be produced at different sites by teams with dif-\nferent expertise. The central and especially reinforced\nload-bearing structure of the satellite also provides\non its z-side the separation interface to the launcher\nor launcher dispenser structure which has to carry\nheavy structural stress as well. The Galileo satellites\nmust comply with single and multiple satellite launch\ninterface conditions. There are six isolated thermal\nzones in a satellite, each with its own independent\nthermal design specification and each separately\ncontrolled and monitored:\n\n2/25/09 2:26:22 PM\n",

Particular attention is devoted to zone 1,\nwhich hosts the most sensitive PHMs and is separated\nbya tent of multilayer insulation (MLI) blankets. Each\nclock is mounted on thermally isolated stringers on\nthe +x-wall, which is never exposed to direct sunlight\nduring its operational life.\nDueto its orbital altitude of 23 620 km, each satellite is\nsignificantly exposed to space radiation (Van Allen belt)\ncreated by highly energetic electron densities from\nsolar flares and galactic cosmic radiation. The radia-\ntion can cause latchup effects in electronic circuits\nand memories with inadequate protection. The radia-\ntion intensities vary with the 11-year cycle of solar\nactivity. Protective measures include utilization of\nspecifically space-radiation-hardened devices as well\nas additional protection through shielding walls of\nhigh-specific-density material (e.g., tantalum). The\nlatter method can only be applied to components with\nhigh radiation sensitivity because of the overall mass\nconstraints. The early Galileo satellites carry radiation\ndosimeters to determine the actual radiation condi-\ntions in the selected orbits over longer periods to avoid\noverspecification of follow-on satellites.\n\n8.6.3.2 Primary Power Supply\n\nTwo solar power generators each produce 850 W (end-\nof-life) DC power to supply all platform and payload\nequipment. Batteries with capacities of about 30Ah\nconsisting of cells manufactured using lithium-ion\ntechnology ensure uninterrupted power supply to\nthe satellite subsystems during solar eclipses as well as\n\nCHO8.indd 723\n\n723\n\nduring the early launch and injection phases. During\nthe long ascent phase caused by the required direct in-\norbit injection, the closed launcher fairing blocks the\nsolar illumination. The batteries provide the primary\npower through an electronic power conditioner that\nmaintains a constant DC bus voltage of 50V under\nall operational load and environmental conditions.\nAs an exception, three devices (the hydrazine valves,\nthe Sun sensors and the magnetic torque device)\noperate with 28V. Critical elements of the power\nsubsystem are the two solar array drive mechanisms\n(SADMs) conducting the solar current into the bat-\nteries and ensuring fine tracking of the Sun while the\nsatellite body turns around the y-axis during each\norbit. As mentioned earlier, the power subsystem has\nparticularly to maintain battery power for the clocks\nand other sensitive devices in the satellite during the\nlong direct injection ascent phase when the solar ar-\nray is stowed to fit within the surrounding fairing. A\nminimum charge current will, however, be available\nafter jettison of the fairing and when the last launcher\nstage begins to rotate around its velocity axis. During\nthis phase none of the high-power-consuming devices\noperates except the heaters, in order to maintain the\nminimum specified thermal conditions for critical\nequipment. The DC power distribution on-board\nis implemented by a star-shaped cable tree. Resetting\nelectronic fuses protect the fixed power lines from\nshort-circuit effects while all switchable power lines\nare protected by not automatically regenerating fuses.\nDuring all ground operations DC power is provided\nto the satellite through an externally accessible power\nconnector. Particularly careful attention is required for\nthe DC supply that fires the explosive devices (squibs)\nwhich release a holding clamp band when the launcher\nstage has reached the final orbital position, so that the\nsatellite can be released.\n\n8.6.3.3 On-board Computer and Data Bus\n\nThe on-board computer, actually the integrated\ncontrol and data unit (ICDU), controls the entire\nstatus of the satellite by means of sensors and actu-\nators and communicates it via RF telemetry links to\nthe Galileo control centers (GCC) in Oberpfaffen-\nhofen (Germany) and Fucino (Italy). The ICDU is\nthe central unit for controlling and monitoring all\n\n2/25/09 2:26:22 PM\n",
    "745": "CHO8.indd 724\n\n724\n\nplatform housekeeping and payload functions. For\nthis purpose, the ICDU interfaces directly with the\ntelecommand receiver and the corresponding tele-\nmetry transmitter and controls the other equipment\nand functional elements through an MIL 1553B\ndata bus, as shown in Figure 8.6.5 below. The CPU is\nan ERC 32 bit processor providing sufficient power\nwith growth capabilities for real-time applications\nand extended satellite autonomy. An input/output\n(I/O) module provides access to all sensors and plat-\nform units, valves, etc. The ICDU communicates\nalso through the 1553 bus with special security units\ndedicated to the platform and the payload to ensure\nhigh-security protection against malicious access to\nthe satellite. In addition to the 1553 bus, a space-wire\ndata network enables switching of redundancy units\nin the platform and in the payload equipment. One\nimportant function of the ICDU is to determine the\ninstantaneous attitude of the spacecraft from inputs\nof the Sun and Earth sensors. If a change of attitude\nis commanded from the ground the ICDU software\nwill control the appropriate actuators and momentum\nwheels to achieve the new attitude.\n\n8.6.3.4 Telemetry and Telecommand\n\nThe telemetry and telecommand system (TM/TC)\nconnects the globally distributed TM/TC stations to\nthe two dedicated GCCs in Oberpfaffenhofen near\nMunich and Fucino near Rome and to the satellites via\nRF communication links in the 2 GHz frequency band\n(S-band). Through these links the two centers control\nthe housekeeping functions of all Galileo satellites\nin space. Telecommand and telemetry signals from\nTM/TC stations are handled by two helical receiver\nand transmit antennas located on opposite corners\non-board the satellite and the TM/TC transponder\n(see Figures 8.6.2 and 8.6.5). To receive the telecom-\nmand signal the transponder demodulates the BPSK-\nmodulated telecommand signal of 1 kbit/s NRZ-L and\nchannel encoded and source encoded with a standard\nBCH block code. The transponder receiver delivers the\ndata stream to the ICDU via the platform security unit.\nThe telemetry stream information is delivered at a bit\nrate of 20 kbit/s NRZ-L encoded to the same antennas\nfor transmission to the TM/TC ground stations. In\naccordance with the international CCSDS standard,\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nthe data content is protected with a Reed-Solomon\n(RS) convolution code to detect and correct single bit\nerrors. All encoding applied to the TM/TC links is to\nprotect them against bit errors resulting from noise\nand interference on the RF propagation channel. Both\nlinks for TM and TC can be operated either in the\nESA standard mode or in the relatively new direct\nsequence spread-spectrum mode (also standardized\nby ESA). By radio command, the TC uplink and the\nTM downlink can be interconnected in the spacecraft\nto provide a direct data return link. In this configura-\ntion the two interconnected channels provide an ac-\ntive means for determining the slant range from the\nground station to the connected satellite. This mode\nenables determination of the satellite\u2019s position and\nthus, when repeated at later dates or from different\nground stations, allows derivation of the Kepler data\nset necessary to predict the orbit. For Galileo this\nmethodology is not sufficiently accurate. Therefore,\nin the Galileo system, a sophisticated global groun\nmission and sensor network, including laser ranging\nstations, determines the high-precision orbit para-\nmeters. Before entering the ICDU the telecomman\ndata is decrypted in a classified hardware environment\nto avoid unauthorized intrusion into the comman\nlinks. Two receive and transmit antennas with an\nomnidirectional antenna characteristic (\u20143 dBi)\nare mounted on both the lower and upper side en\npositions of the satellite to ensure reliable access of\nthe TM/TC ground stations to the satellite under all\nattitude conditions. This is particularly important\nin emergencies. A comprehensive software package\nenables a variety of different transmission modes for\nthe required telecommand, such as single commands,\nfile transfer and other specific data structures.\n\n8.6.3.5 Attitude and Orbit Control\n\nAll satellites of the constellation need to be kept in\ntheir nominal orbital positions to maintain an equal\ndistance among them in the orbital plane as this en-\nsures an equal distribution of all satellites around the\nglobe. For the same reason, the satellites in the neigh-\nboring orbital planes must remain in their positions\nto maintain the optimum phasing in the constellation.\nBecause the implementation concept of Galileo relies\non direct injection into the final orbital position, the\n\n2/25/09 2:26:23 PM\n",
    "746": "8.6 Galileo Satellites\n\nsatellites do not need a powerful propulsion system\nfor orbital maneuvers. With the small 10N thrusters\nand 70 liters of monopropellant fuel (hydrazine), a\nsatellite creates a total Av of about 180m/s over its\nlifetime, which is sufficient to drift eventually into its\nfinal graveyard orbit. The three-axis attitude control\nensures permanent orientation of the +z-axis toward\nthe center of the Earth (nadir pointing) while the\nsolar arrays remain Sun pointing during each orbital\nrevolution. Two Sun sensors, one each for coarse and\nfine tracking of the Sun, and two Earth sensors pro-\nvide all the information required to determine the\nactual attitude. Three redundant computer-controlled\nwheels with large rotating masses orient the satellite\naround the three degrees of freedom (axes) and are\nable to achieve any required attitude position. A com-\nprehensive software package for attitude control takes\nover immediately after separation from the launcher.\nThis unique software package provides all control\nand monitoring functionality and can be activated by\nground control commands. One of the first maneuvers\nafter separation and housekeeping tests is to deploy the\nsolar arrays to ensure sufficient availability of primary\npower. The software also provides autonomous\nactivities, for example, in case of an emergency, by\nchanging the attitude into Sun acquisition mode as\nthe fail-safe mode and alerting ground control to\ntake appropriate action. Besides keeping the satellite\nin Sun-pointing mode to maintain electrical power\nsupply, in this case it would also be important to\nmaintain stable thermal conditions in each area and to\nconfigure the other systems of the satellite in a standby\nmode to support satellite-saving measures. A globally\ndistributed network of 10 ground stations is located\nsuch that at any moment in time each satellite is in\ndirect radio line of sight of at least one station.\n\n8.6.3.6 Laser Ranging Reflector\n\nFor ultra-precise ranging and orbit determination, the\nsatellites are equipped with a passive laser ranging\nreflector (LRR) located on the Earth-pointing surface\n(+z). Because the overall achievable ranging accuracy\nshould be in the order of less than 1 m over a slant\nrange distance of about 26000000 m from a ground\nterminal to the satellite, the instantaneous position of\nthe satellite varies slightly due to the slightly varying\n\nCHO8.indd 725\n\n725\n\ngravity conditions at each point. Laser ranging enables\ndetermination of the instantaneous slant range to the\nsatellite in the order of a few centimeters, albeit only\nduring optical visibility conditions. More information\nabout the global network of several laser ranging sta-\ntions is provided in [8.6.6].\n\n8.6.3.7 Propulsion\n\nDue to the very limited number of satellite orbital\nmaneuvers, the propulsion system comprises a mono-\npropellant (hydrazine) system with a spherical tank\nof about 100 liters volume and four fully redundantly\nprovisioned 1N thrusters. The tank is mounted on\nan enforced frame structure to cope with the high\ndynamic forces during launch and separation. Pipes\nmade of special titanium alloys deliver the fuel from\nthe tank to the thrusters through electrically control-\nlable valves. For safety reasons, during the launch\ncampaign a \u201csafe\u201d/\u201carm\u201d connector accessible from\noutside the satellite prevents the unintentional fir-\ning of thrusters. This connector eventually is set to\nthe \u201carm\u201d position as one of the final steps in the\ncountdown procedure after the spacecraft is fully\nloaded with fuel, mounted in the fairing and ready for\nlaunch. The propulsion system also has a drain outlet\nto evacuate the tank during qualification tests when\nthe tank is filled with nontoxic replacement liquids,\nand also in case of an aborted launch.\n\n8.6.3.8 Wire and Cable Harness\n\nToday, the wire and cable harness still forms the cen-\ntral nervous system of a satellite. There is a growing\ntrend to use serial data buses for the data and control\ncommunications, as in industrial and home computer\nnetworks. On-board the Galileo satellites the serial\n1553B bus is applied, which is not optimized for sat-\nellites but which has evolved over many years into a\nmore or less de facto standard. Other buses, such as the\nCAN bus widely used in the automobile industry, is\nused in one of the two preoperational Galileo satellites\n(GIOVE A). However, the great leap in mass saving\nwith an optical or wireless LAN on-board has not yet\noccurred, mainly due to high RF power-level condi-\ntions in the vicinity of the spacecraft \u2014 but who knows\nwhat will happen in the future? The heaviest wires are\n\n2/25/09 2:26:23 PM\n",
    "747": "CHO8.indd 726\n\n726\n\nthose which carry the primary power to high-power\nconsumers such as the HPA RF stages. Another op-\ntion is to use the metal surface of the satellite for the\nground return, if a metal surface is actually provided\nto cover the honeycomb structure.\n\n8.6.4 The Galileo Payload\n\n8.6.4.1 Payload Architecture\n\nThe payload architecture as shown in Figure 8.6.5\n\nprovides the following performance features:\n\ne Generation and conditioning of the high-precision\nnavigation clock signals created on-board.\n\ne Receiving, demodulating, decoding and storing\nuplinked system data such as ephemerides, al-\nmanacs, timing and time-offset values for clock\ncorrection in users\u2019 receivers and others.\n\ne Receiving and sequencing integrity data uplin-\nked by the integrity determination ground net-\nworks.\n\ne Composing different navigation messages for\nthe navigation services (open service, SoL, public\nregulated service and the commercial service)\nincluding forward error correction decoding.\n\ne Generating the different spreading codes for the\nsignals.\n\ne Particular encryption of the coding for the secu-\nrity signal (public regulated service).\n\ne Conversion of the baseband signals to the actual\nRF transmission frequencies as well as power\namplification for transmission by the navigation\nantenna with isoflux characteristics.\n\nTo provide these functions the payload comprises the\n\nfollowing equipment:\n\n\u00b0 Mission receiver with its own dedicated antenna\nin the 5000-5010 MHz band (C-band) for the\nreception of mission-relevant data for navigation\nmessages and control functions of the payload.\n\ne Ultrastable oscillators (atomic frequency stan-\ndards) in rubidium and, very ambitiously, passive\nhydrogen maser technologies (RAFS and PHM).\n\ne Control and monitoring unit (CMCU) for the\noscillators and their redundant units to process\nthe 10.23 MHz and the 10.00 MHz high-precision\nfrequency clocks from both units.\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\ne Decryption unit to secure authorized access to\nthe payload.\n\ne Navigation signal generator unit to create mathe-\nmatically correct signals in the time domain for\nthe multiplexed E1, E5 and E6 signals.\n\ne RF carrier oscillators synchronized with the\nmother clock signal.\n\ne Wideband 50W and 70W RE linear power am-\nplifier for the L-band frequency ranges of 1164\u2014\n1300 MHz and 1559-1594 MHz, respectively.\n\ne High-power output multiplexer for common\ntransmission of the E5 and E6 signals as well as\nthe direct through-path for the E1 signal.\n\ne The main navigation antenna transmitting all\nsignals, which requires extremely wideband cha-\nracteristics combined with isoflux characteristics.\nThis is to ensure less RF power in the boresight\ndirection pointing toward the subsatellite point\nand more RF power dedicated to the edges of the\ncoverage.\n\ne Remote terminal units to provide the connecting\ninterface to the computer for many sensors, actua-\ntors and switching devices.\n\ne A stand-alone transponder with its own receive\nand transmit antenna system listening on the\ninternational distress calling frequencies in the\n406 MHz band, as well as a transmission antenna\nfor the radio link to the COSPAS-SARSAT ground\nnetwork (local user terminal).\n\n8.6.4.2 Payload Equipment\n\nC-band Mission Receiver\n\nThe mission receiver receives the spread-spectrum\nmodulated and coded signals transmitted by a global\nnetwork of mission uplink stations in the C-band,\n5000-5010 MHz. It is thus ensured that seamless, ro-\nbust and reliable access to the payload is possible at any\nmoment in time. The receive antenna is implemented\nas a right hand circularly polarized (RHCP) horn\nantenna with a comparatively low gain to provide a\nwide angle of capture for uplink stations. After the\nreceived signal is downconverted, demodulated and\ndespread, it is routed through a security unit into\nthe navigation signal generator where its content is\nprocessed and submitted to the navigation message\nencoder and sequencer.\n\n2/25/09 2:26:23 PM\n",

    "749": "CHO8.indd 728\n\n728\n\nUltrastable Frequency Standard Generators\n\nThe core of all navigation satellites is the on-board\nultrahigh-precision clock generator, selected from\na group with different technologies and redundant\nstandards. They are also called \u201cclocks,\u201d although\nthey actually provide a precise frequency signal or\npulse trains and not \u201creal time-clock\u201d information.\nA real time clock with hours and minutes is derived\nfrom such a clock generator by a time definition of\nthe Galileo on-board and system time. Real time is\ninternationally defined by convention of time and\ndate. This time is defined in the ground station and\nsynchronized to the international reference of coordi-\nnated universal time (UTC) by counting the seconds to\nhigher units (minutes, hours, etc.). The ground system\ntime is compared to the actually disseminated signal\ntime from space and the instantaneous time error\n(ns) is transmitted via the navigation message. With\nthis information, receivers correct the instantaneous\ntime error by \u201csoftware\u201d rather than by adjusting the\nhardware. Galileo satellites apply two different tech-\nnologies for the clocks: the more traditional rubidium\natomic frequency standard (RAFS), used on-board\nGPS satellites for many years, and two highly sophisti-\ncated passive hydrogen masers (PHMs) developed by\nEuropean industry under ESA contract specifically for\nthis application. The clock generator generates a time\nsignal to the highest precision regarding phase noise,\nfrequency stability and lowest drifts. The frequency\nstability of RAFS is in the order of 107s while the\nPHM can achieve a long-term stability of 107\u2019 s over\n24h. Any of the four clocks on-board the satellites can\ncreate the master clock signal, which is selected by the\nclock monitoring control unit (CMCU) and used to\nderive coherently all RF carriers, subcarriers and mixer\nfrequencies for upconversion and data rates.\n\nAll clocks run continuously, providing the mas-\nter clock as selected by ground control. On-board\nclock accuracy is controlled on the ground with an\nensemble of high-precision clocks at the locations\nof many standard time service providers. Devia-\ntions are not corrected by physical clock corrections\nbut through parameters of a clock model taking all\nimpacts including the relativistic compensation into\naccount. After physical changes it takes several days\nto restabilize the clock for use. By applying reverse\nmodeling the navigation receiver can calculate the real\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\ninstantaneous arrival time of the phase coherent signal\ntoa high precision [8.6.7]. The on-board master clock\nis conditioned and distributed to a variety of on-board\npayload equipment and to the linear converter inside\nthe SAR transponder. In total there are actually five\nindependent clock-synchronized systems on-board;\nall of them are eventually synchronized with the\nGalileo system time. This ensures that any reason-\nable combination of Galileo signals in the connected\nreceivers (e.g., single- and dual-frequency receivers)\nwill lead to valid position solutions.\n\nNavigation Signal Generator\n\nThe navigation signal generator unit (NSGU) gener-\nates three composite signals named \u201cEl,\u201d \u201cE5,\u201d and\n\u201cE6\u201d which are permanently transmitted from all\nGalileo satellites. Each signal comprises two (E5) or\nthree (E6, El) components that alone or in combi-\nnation can be used by a wide range of receivers for\nlow- and high-end applications. Data message con-\ntent uplinked from the ground control centers via\nthe connected uplink station is decomposed in the\nNSGU and recombined (added) at bit rates from 50 to\n250 bit/s to the pseudo-random noise (PRN) stream.\nThe PRN-coded subcarriers applied for the Galileo\nsignals are spread by direct sequence spreading up to\n15 million chips. The NSGU generates all the signals\nat baseband level, as shown in Figure 8.6.1. By means\nof different binary offset coding (BOC) schemes the\nsignals have different spectral power distributions,\nwhich is desirable for sharing frequency bands among\nthe many signals of the same constellation as well as\namong signals of different constellations. This is very\nimportant since not only do other RNSS systems\nshare the frequency bands, but so too do other radio\nservices such as primary radar. With the extremely\nwide bandwidth spreading (e.g., 50 bit/s over 32 MHz)\nGalileo actually produces nearly white-noise-like\nsignals which cause minimal interference with other\nsystems, if any.\n\nCarrier Generator and Frequency Upconverter\n\nAll baseband signals delivered by the NSGU are up-\nconverted to the three final dedicated RF carrier\nfrequencies in the following frequency generation\nand upconversion unit (FGUU). A local oscillator\nsynchronized to the high-precision standard signal\n(10.23 MHz) generates the carrier signals, followed\n\n2/25/09 2:26:24 PM\n",
    "750": "8.6 Galileo Satellites\n\nby a mixture stage that converts them to the final\nfrequencies. All generated signals applied to the up-\nconverters to create each of the three carrier signals\nare intermediate-frequency (IF) signals which them-\nselves are also synchronized to the master clock sig-\nnal. Each of the navigation signals, El, E5 and E6, is\nmultiplexed with the associated navigation message\ntransmitted at effective symbol rates ranging from 50\nto 1000 bit/s. Since the redundancy bits ensuring the\nrequired forward error correction (FEC) capability\nrequire an overhead of 50% of the symbol rate, it\nleaves the other 50% for net data information. This\ncapacity enables transmission of all mandatory system\ninformation, comprising almanacs, ephemerides, time\nerror and geodetic reference data, as well as integrity\ninformation and acknowledgment messages for dis-\ntress calls and more, differing for each signal.\n\nRF Power Amplifier\n\nThe readily composed signals on the exact RF trans-\nmission frequency are linearly amplified to the speci-\nfied output power level through an ensemble of\nredundantly configured SSPAs. The E5 and E6 signals\nin the lower frequency band of 1164-1300 MHz with\neffective RF bandwidths of 51 and 40 MHz, respec-\ntively, are routed through 70W REF amplifiers confi-\ngured in a 2-for-1 redundancy. The amplified signals\nare then applied to the antenna through an output\nmultiplexer. The E1 signal with an RF bandwidth of\nabout 35 MHz is amplified to an RF output power of\n50 W through a 3-for-2 redundancy SSPA configura-\ntion. This means that the output power is provided\nby two parallel SSPAs selected out of three. Optimized\nbandpass filters in each branch of the power amplifica-\ntion stages reject out-of-band emissions and harmo-\n\nnics to avoid harmful interference with radio services\nin neighboring and harmonic frequency bands. The\nradio astronomy service is particularly sensitive\nto interference and thus uses very large high-gain\nantennas. The primary power provided by the solar\narrays is designed to ensure permanent operation of\nall three signals.\n\nMain Navigation Antenna\n\nThe main transmit antenna for the navigation signals\nconsists of an array of radiators, which by appropri-\nate phasing of all feed elements creates an RHCP\n\nCHO8.indd 729\n\n729\n\nwavefront and the required isopower flux characteris-\ntics. The isoflux characteristic means that the received\npower level at a received reference antenna located on\nthe Earth\u2019s surface stays nearly equal if the antenna is\nlocated at the center of the radiation (boresight equal\nto subsatellite point) or at the edge of the coverage.\nThis special characteristic is achieved for both fre-\nquency bands, 1164-1300 MHz and 1559-1594 MHz,\nby two physically implemented beam-forming net-\nworks mounted below the feed array. The antenna\ndesign is quite sophisticated as some of the elements\ncontribute to both bands. The antenna gain is adjusted\nto the coverage requirements of that antenna which\nserves the entire visible surface of the Earth. The\nantenna characteristic has lower gain at the center\n(corresponding to 90\u00b0 elevation from a ground an-\ntenna) and higher gain at the edge of coverage (defined\nby 5\u00b0 elevation from a ground antenna). The system is\ndefined and designed so that each satellite provides a\nsignal receive power of typically \u2014122 dBm at a \u201c0 dBi\u201d\nantenna located anywhere on the surface of the Earth,\nat any time. It is very important for service quality to\nprovide exact phase relations among all transmitted\nsignals, which is ensured as explained above. In addi-\ntion, the satellite design ensures that the phase center\nof the antenna is less than 20cm from the center of\ngravity of the satellite. This minimizes the impact on\nthe dilution of precision caused by the rotation of\nthe satellite around the z-axis during each orbit, as\nexplained in Section 8.6.3.5.\n\n8.6.4.3 Search and Rescue Payload\n\nThe SAR transponder on-board the Galileo satellites\nwill provide a major improvement regarding timely\navailability of the international air and sea rescue\nservices offered under the intergovernmental CO-\nSPAS-SARSAT agreement among France, the USA,\nCanada and the Russian Federation, with more than\n30 associated ground segment providers, user states\nand international organizations such as ICAO, IMO,\nITU, and others. Galileo supports the services of this\norganization to \u201cassist search and rescue activities on\na worldwide basis by providing accurate, timely, and\nreliable alert and location data to the international\ncommunity on a nondiscriminatory basis\u201d [8.6.8]\nby providing full and permanent seamless global\n\n2/25/09 2:26:25 PM\n",
    "751": "CHO8.indd 730\n\n730\n\ncoverage for distress calls. Full global coverage is pro-\nvided by only half of the Galileo in-orbit fleet for SAR\naccess. The Galileo SAR transponders receive distress\nsignals from registered distress beacons (EPIRB) on\nthe internationally allocated frequency band of 406.0\u2014\n406.1 MHz and retransmit the linearly converted\nuplink signals in the band of 1544.05-1544.15 MHz\nthat is also protected by international conventions for\nSAR purposes (ITU-R). So-called local user terminals\n(COSPAS-SARSAT LUTs) receive the distress calls\nthat are repeated through Galileo (and other GSO\nand non-GSO) satellites and generate a dedicated ac-\nknowledgment message to the particular distress-call-\ning terminal (emergency position-indicating radio\nbeacon (EPIRB)) through the navigation message in\nthe Galileo open service signal. By notifying the caller\nthat the call is affirmed and that appropriate rescue\nactions are underway, including brief messages about\nthe measures taken, the caller is made aware of the\nstatus and can stop any further transmissions, lead-\ning also to more efficient use of the sensitive distress\ncall channels.\n\nThe SAR antenna is an array of six quadrifilar\nhelical receive antennas mounted on an electrically\nconducting ground plane with a transmitting back-\nfire L-band antenna in the center for the downlink,\nas shown in Figure 8.6.2. The feeds of both antennas\nare phased to achieve RHCP for the receive and LHCP\nfor the transmit antenna. The uplink receive RF band-\nwidth of 90 kHz can be repeated in one slice or split\ninto two subbands of about 50 kHz each to be filtered\nand retransmitted on the downlink. Besides receiving\ndistress calls from a new generation of EPIRBs with\nbuilt-in GNSS receivers, the system also still supports\nthe use of the legacy mode where EPIRBs are located\nthrough triangulation by LUTs through signals from\nseveral satellites. The legacy mode is still supported by\nGalileo because many EPIRBs are still in use. However,\nbecause of many false alerts it has been decided by CO-\nSPAS-SARSAT [8.6.8] that, as from February 1, 2009,\nonly the 406 MHz band will remain for SAR while the\nother distress frequencies of 121.5 MHz and 243 MHz\nused so far will no longer be supported. It may also be\nconsidered that only EPIRBs with built-in GNSS re-\nceivers will be supported, first, as stated earlier, to free\nthe frequency channel for further potential distress\ncalls and, second, and probably equally important,\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nto save battery energy in case more calls are necessary\nbefore an acknowledgment is received.\n\n8.6.5 Launcher Interfaces\n\nTo rapidly build up the space segment of the Galileo\nsystem, during the deployment phase the majority of\nsatellites are to be carried into space by multisatellite\nlaunches using Ariane 5. To achieve this, a decision\nto place more (10) satellites in fewer (three) orbital\nplanes as compared to GPS with its six orbital planes\nwas taken in 1999 after completion of an ESA com-\nparative systems study. To complete the constellation\nand for later replacement of individual satellites,\nsingle launches with other systems such as Soyuz\nwith the Fregat upper stage, Zenit or Proton rockets\nare also possible, given an appropriate satellite design.\nFor multisatellite launches, dispenser structures sup-\nport the carriage and safe separation, enabling the\nlaunchers to place each satellite into its final orbital\npositions, as shown in Figure 8.6.4. The dynamic\nand environmental conditions required to comply\nwith several different launcher interfaces have a large\nimpact on the design of the satellites. Exacting tests\nto confirm the survival of the satellites in the fierce\nenvironment of the launches are mandatory. This is\ndiscussed in the next section.\n\n8.6.6 Satellite Assembly, Integration\nand Testing (AIT)\n\n8.6.6.1 Introduction\n\nThe following sections discuss the stages of deve-\nlopment and manufacturing of the main compo-\nnents, equipment and subsystems, and the process of\nverification of all specified parameters as well as the\nqualification for achieving flight approval. The satel-\nlites comprise two separately integrated and tested\nmodules. These are the platform module with all\nthe subsystems required to provide and maintain the\nmandatory electrical and environmental operations\nconditions and the payload module carrying all the\nflight components of the navigation system which is\nthe purpose of the mission. Having two main modules\n\n2/25/09 2:26:25 PM\n",
    "752": "8.6 Galileo Satellites\n\nenables separate integration and test activities, which\nleads to significant time and cost savings. Due to the\nrelatively high number of satellites to be produced\nfor the Galileo constellation, the satellites and their\nmodules must also be designed to comply with re-\nquirements for ease of manufacture. Therefore, two\nintegration sites, one for payloads and one for plat-\nforms, will tentatively be contracted by ESA acting on\nbehalf of the EU for series production. The potential\nsites selected so far are organized in consecutive pro-\nduction \u201ccells\u201d where assigned mechanical and electri-\ncal integration steps are performed. Accordingly, each\ncell is equipped with appropriate tools, work skills\nand test equipment. Each satellite, starting with the\ncarrying structure, travels on a movable dolly from\none cell to the next for completion, thus allowing the\nspecialized teams, their tools and the test equipment\nto remain at their cell positions.\n\n8.6.6.2 Model Philosophy\n\nNearly all payload equipment and some of the platform\nsystems have been developed especially for the Galileo\nnavigation mission, taking into account the space\nradiation conditions for space vehicles travelling at\nan altitude of nominally 23 616 km. The development\ncycle undergoes similar model steps for all the space\nequipment. A distinction is made between models for\nfunctional tests, models for software development,\nmodels for interface verification and, last but not least,\nmodels for environmental tests to achieve qualification\nfor space flight. After integration of the components\ninto the platform or payload modules, tests only on\nthe module level will be performed since the individual\npieces of equipment will already have proven their\nqualification for space flight. In the frame of the four-\nyear cycle of system and equipment development, the\nso-called \u201cin-orbit validation (IOV)\u201d phase, each piece\nof equipment developed for Galileo passes through\nfour model stages, STM-EM-\u2014PFM-FM:\n\ne The structure and thermal model (STM) to verify\nthe mechanical interfaces for fixing points, cable\nharness routings, mass and volume under specified\nenvironmental conditions.\n\ne The engineering model (EM) to develop and\nverify all electrical interfaces (functional hardware\nand software interfaces).\n\nCHO8.indd 731\n\n731\n\ne The prototype flight model (PFM) to undergo all\nthe tests for approval of space qualification (tem-\nperature, vacuum, electromagnetic compatibility\n(EMC)), vibration, acoustic noise, etc. The PFM\ncomprises all redundant parts and may even be\nused in some cases as the later flight model.\n\ne The flight model (FM) to be assembled in a qua-\nlified manufacturing process and applied to all\nsatellites in the constellation.\n\nDepending on the complexity or the technology of a\npiece of equipment, several models of the same category\nmay be necessary. This is the case for instance for the\nnewly developed RAFS. Besides the development of\non-board equipment, further variants of the same\nequipment are developed, for example for transport-\nable satellite simulators, so-called suitcase equipment.\nThese simulators are mainly used to test and verify\nthe performance and the various RF interfaces with\nthe ground stations. The suitcase equipment receives\nand transmits 2GHz TM/TC signals with representa-\ntive protocols and \u201creceives\u201d mission uplink messages\nwith correct protocols in the 5 GHz band. Additional\nRF interfaces allow the SAR transponder functions to\nbe tested. Similar to the component model philosophy\nused by the various suppliers, different satellite models\nsupport the development of the satellites before series\nproduction of the flight models commences. The details\nof these models are as follows.\n\nStructure and Thermal Model (STM)\n\nThe STM allows design decisions to be verified, such\nas the accommodation of equipment, placing of the\nfuel tank, valves and pipes, sensors, cable harness rout-\nings and fixings. Even though the entire design of the\nspacecraft evolves with the help of CAD programs on\na workstation, a real mass model remains important\nto obtain information on mechanical, dynamic and\nthermal loads at each corner of the satellite. The STM\nalso serves to verify the launcher interface and the\nseparation system.\n\nEngineering Model (EM)\n\nThe EM is functionally a complete satellite, albeit not\napproved for flight. Therefore, the EM usually verifies\nall interfaces with the ground segment and all the\nperformance parameters required by the spacecraft\n\n2/25/09 2:26:25 PM\n",
    "753": "CHO8.indd 732\n\n732\n\nspecification. The interfaces to be tested and veri-\nfied comprise the RF links to the mission uplink and\nTM/TC stations as well as the direct access wire\nlink (umbilical) to the on-board computer. The\numbilical cable enables direct access and satellite\ncontrol independent of RF link access. Beyond this,\nthe EM provides representative structural and equip-\nment conditions for investigating and verifying the\nprotection offered by the installed RF shielding and\nthe measurement of bonding conditions on all metal\nsurfaces. All metal surfaces must be interconnected\nwith the lowest resistance bonding possible to ensure\nequipotential among all conductive elements of the\nsatellite and to neutralize potentially high voltages\nthat can build up when the satellite travels through\nareas of charged particles emitted by solar flares.\nLow-resistance bonding prevents the build-up of\ndifferently charged surfaces in one part of the satellite\nwhich could result in sudden high-voltage discharges.\nThese discharges could potentially destroy equipment\nor the entire satellite. Good bonding and shielding are\nalso important prerequisites for preventing different\nelectrical potentials and high-voltage peaks in the\nvicinity of high-power devices (SSPA). Furthermore,\ngood bonding is essential for avoiding ground loops\nwhich can cause humming and sometimes unstable\noperating conditions in the equipment and subsys-\ntems. Last but not least, the EM is used to test and\nverify the important interface with the electrical\nground support equipment (EGSE) to be certified\nfor use with flight hardware.\n\nPrototype Flight Model (PFM)\n\nThe PEM is a complete satellite built according to full\nflight standards to test the effect of all the environmen-\ntal interface conditions that are expected during launch\nand in orbit, including the highest expected levels. A\nPEM comprises all the components, redundancies and\nmaterials of a flight model. Although not fully flight\nqualified, since it has been comprehensively tested the\nPFM might be launched as an additional flight unit\nhowever with reduced lifetime expectations.\n\nFlight Model (FM)\n\nThe FM comprises only flight-standard components\nand redundancies and is subjected to lower test profiles\nconfirming more the manufacture of the assembly\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nrather than verification of the design. In case of\nlaunch delays, Galileo FMs are stored under controlled\nenvironmental (clean-room) and power conditions.\nAlthough FMs are stored without batteries, external\npower supplies ensure permanent stand-by opera-\ntion of the high-precision clocks (PHM). Even during\nthe transport of the satellites, clean-room and opera-\ntions conditions must seamlessly continue until the\nsatellite is mounted atop the launcher. The clean-room\nconditions even continue until the fairing is jettisoned\ninto free space when contamination by particles or\nliquids can no longer occur. In the Galileo program\nwith its 30 operational FMs in space, each satellite will\nundergo a reduced test program because all processes\nfor the final assembly and integration line have been\npreviously validated and proven to be repeatable, en-\nsuring consistent manufacturing and system quality.\nAt the time of writing, the actual conditions for the\nseries production of the Galileo satellites are still be-\ning determined because the European Commission,\nas the system owner and operator, has not yet made\nall decisions concerning the additional deliveries\nneeded to complete the system. The presently ongoing\ndevelopment phase (the IOV phase) will eventually\nresult in four satellites in space with all the essential\nkey ground system elements operationally necessary\nto prove the overall system concept. In the context\nof the IOV phase, further test environments will be\ndeveloped and verified for use in the full deployment\nphase of the program.

This\ncomprises all interface signals and connections to the\nplatform module as well as to all payload equipment.\nDedicated special checkout equipment (SCOE) al-\nlows each payload unit to be appropriately operated.\nThe test results achieved at the station already form\npart of the overall data package to achieve flight quali-\nfication and will thus not be repeated in the course of\nthe final satellite integration.

The SVF provides all the\nfacilities (computer, interfaces, tools, etc.) to test and\nverify any additions and modifications to the flight\nsoftware. Together with the satellite simulator, the SVF\nis a permanent instrument that follows the spacecraft\nthroughout its lifetime and provides a controlled\nenvironment for any change or upgrade of the flight\nsoftware in accordance with the applicable quality\nprocedures. Any software change is first verified on\nthis facility before it is uploaded to the satellites in\nspace. This both ensures that only valid software gets\nuploaded to the satellite and guarantees that approved\nand configuration-controlled software is loaded on\nthe on-board computers.\n\nAvionics Test Bed (ATB)\n\nFollowing the practice of the aviation industry to con-\nsider all on-board equipment as \u201cavionics,\u201d the satellite\nindustry also tends to call the attitude and orbit con-\ntrol system (AOCS) \u201cavionics.\u201d The complex test envi-\nronment needed for the development and closed-loop\nverification of algorithms and subsystem performance\nis modeled with a special avionics test bed facility. An\nATB enables the simulation and testing of algorithms\nfor attitude control and their actual implementation\nby stimulating the Sun and Earth sensors as well as the\nactuators and wheels to apply physical forces and mo-\nmentum. Both normal and nonnominal operational\nconditions can be simulated in order to investigate\nalgorithms, software and corresponding peripherals\nduring nominal and emergency conditions. An ATB\ncomprises representative components of the Galileo\nAOCS subsystem: a nonflight but electrically repre-\nsentative flight computer (ICDU); all coarse and fine\nsensors, wheels and gyroscopes; and the simulators\nrepresenting the Sun and Earth as \u201cseen\u201d from any real\nposition in the orbital planes. The ATB is completed\nby a suspension harness allowing full 3D movements\n\nCHO8.indd 733\n\n733\n\nto stimulate and investigate AOCS performance under\nrepresentative dynamic conditions.\n\n8.6.6.3 Integration and Platform Tests\n\nThe model and modular test philosophy breaks up the\ndesign and development phase of the satellites into\nseveral activities performed at separate places with\ndedicated test systems and skills. The overall project\nmanagement coordinates all activities with regard to\nthe schedule which in turn is driven by the customer\nand the launch date for a satellite or group of satellites\nin the case of multisatellite launches. The development\nprogram for the satellites foresees the following steps\ntoward final release for flight (launch):\ne Mechanical and structural approval of the satel-\nite design (in a preliminary design review followed\nater by a critical design review, PDR/CDR)\ne Proof of thermal balance in all anticipated nomi-\nnal and emergency operational situations of the\nsatellites\ne Proof of the electromagnetic compatibility\n(EMC) of the satellite and its subsystems, again\nunder all operational conditions\ne Detailed verification of all performance para-\nmeters as required by the satellite specification\n8.6.3] under all environmental conditions (for\nlatform and payload)\ne Verification of the flight software and all in-\nterfaces with the satellite subsystems and ICDU\neriphery\ne Verification of all satellite interfaces with the\ncorresponding ground stations (TM/TC, mission\nuplink stations, sensor stations, etc.).\n\nThe complete verification program is only applied to\nthe first four satellites (IOV phase). It is not repeated\nfor each follow-up satellite unless necessitated by a\nmajor change to the satellite. The flight qualification\nis applied to all satellites that are built to the same\nmanufacturing specifications for the equipment and\nthe satellites. The emphasis of testing during the\nmanufacture of series satellites concentrates on the\nskills and processes to ensure high quality under\ncontinued flight clearance. However, samples are taken\nand submitted for closer reassessment regarding quali-\nfication status. In the case of major changes affecting\n\n2/25/09 2:26:26 PM\n",
    "755": "CHO8.indd 734\n\n734\n\nthe qualification status, a requalification process\n(delta qualification) is performed. Any changes and\ntheir justifications must be seen in light of the impact\non cost and schedule. All the described measures not\nonly serve to verify specifications and avoid risks, but\nalso form the basis for the justification of possible\ninsurance claims if a failure occurs during the in-\norbit lifetime of a satellite. An overview of the typical\ntests performed on each of the models described is\nprovided in Table 8.6.1.\n\n8.6.6.4 Payload Tests\n\nSimilar to the platform test programs, equivalent\npayload tests are performed as integration proceeds\ntoward completion in order to demonstrate the\nspecified payload performance under all anticipated\nenvironmental conditions. However, some differences\nneed to be explained. As shown in Figure 8.6.5, the\npayload contains the ensemble of atomic clocks con-\ntrolled by the CMCU, followed by a frequency car-\nrier generator and the navigation signal generator\nwhich creates the transmission signals (sequencing,\nencoding, modulation, multiplexing) on baseband\nfrequencies. The complex signals, comprising the\nrequired 10 signal components as shown in Figure\n8.6.1, are linearly and coherently upconverted in mixer\nstages by using appropriately derived harmonics from\nthe master clock signal. The frequency upconversion\nstage delivers its composite signals, on final transmit\nfrequencies, through the SSPAs to the navigation\nantenna. All stages have to demonstrate compliance\nwith their specifications before the entire navigation\npayload is verified. The search and rescue payload,\nalthough otherwise independent of the payload, has\nan important interface with the clock ensemble by\nreceiving a coherent and high-precision conversion\nsignal. All equipment undergoes detailed perfor-\nmance verification tests under the suppliers\u2019 control\nand responsibility, also because only the suppliers\nhave the appropriate skills and special test equip-\nment. The main objective of the payload tests is to\nverify that all equipment is working correctly end\nto end and produces navigation signals that comply\nwith the payload specifications under all space envi-\nronmental and electrical conditions. The results are\nused to decide whether the individual components\n\n8 Spacecraft Design Process\n\nand their specifications sufficiently fulfill the actual\nrequirements.\n\nIn planning the test campaign, it is important\nto take account of the high RF radiation power, the\nbehavior of the antenna characteristics under test\nconditions, the sensitivity of the clock generators\nto variations in the ambient temperature, and seve-\nral other aspects to achieve flight approval for the\npayload. Some of the equipment is checked by auto-\nmated routine measurements to determine behavior\nunder long-term operating conditions. One practical\nexample of long-term observation is the monitoring\nof the current drawn by each individual component\nduring nominal operations and during state changes.\nThe recurrence of a typical current profile is a good\nindicator during the production phase of equipment\nand payload behavior to quickly verify that adequate\nquality (product assurance) has been obtained. Trends,\nthe occurrence of unexpectedly high variations or\nshort glitches in current consumption can provide\ngood indications of a critical condition within a unit.\nAn integrated data collection system (IDAS) enables\nall performance data taken during the development\nand lifetime of equipment and payload to be compiled\nand analyzed. Examples of data collected include:\n\ne The bonding conditions to verify the continu-\ning low-resistance interconnectivity of electrical\nground planes and metal surfaces.\n\ne The actual electrical mating condition of multi-\npin cable connectors.\n\ne Thepower supply (total power consumption, volt-\nage stability, inrush currents, power consumption\nof individual pieces of equipment).\n\ne The signal quality of commands and other signals\nregarding voltage level, bit rates, pulse shapes,\nfrequency offsets, etc.\n\ne Voltage levels of the acquired analog sensor in-\nformation.\n\ne Verification of acquired values with specified/ex-\npected values and corresponding tolerances and\ncalibration curves.\n\nDedicated test systems (EGSE) enable the device\nto be tested in any desired mode of operation (by\nstimulation or simulation) to test its performance in\nthe detail required.

The most stressing and lifetime-relevant\npayload tests are concentrated on the EM, while\nthe tests on FMs are limited to those that do not\nimpact the required in-orbit lifetime of at least 12\nyears. The main objective of the limited production\ntests is to detect potential initial component failures\nwhich could occur in the early operational phases\nof equipment. Military equipment even undergoes\ndedicated burn-in tests to separate delivery equip-\nment from the equipment requiring retrofit before\nbeing used in the field. The test program for the FM\npayloads comprises:\n\ne Measurement of the clock accuracy regarding\nsignal level, clock stability (Allan deviation), phase\nnoise behavior, autonomy.\n\ne Determination of the actual characteristics of the\non-board antennas, namely navigation antenna\n(phased array) (1.1-1.59 GHz), mission antenna\n(5 GHz), SAR antennas (406 MHz and 1.544 GHz)\nthrough dedicated test points.\n\ne Measurement of RF characteristics of the trans-\nmission signals regarding RF output power (min/\nmax level and stability), frequency accuracy, signal\nbandwidth of all RF signals, degree of unwanted\nout-of-band emissions, phase relations of trans-\nmitted navigation signals and the achieved wave-\nfront (phase center).

This test verifies the\nthermal balance of each thermal zone in the satellite\nunder varying ambient \u201cspace\u201d conditions imposed\nby different simulated solar illumination and eclip-\nse conditions. It is important to verify by means of\nthe thermal control system that no point within the\nsatellite or in any one of its components will experi-\nence overheating or excessive cooling. The thermal\nbalance conditions verify the absence of excessive me-\nchanical tensions which otherwise would be caused by\nthermal gradients exceeding the specified limits. The\nactive thermal control system is based on a heat pipe\narchitecture that conducts excessive heat particularly\nfrom the high-power amplifiers to the heat radiation\nwalls of the satellite.

It is important that,\nduring the entire transport and storage period from\nthe final integration site to the launch pad, clean-room\nconditions are maintained inside the acclimatized\ntransport and storage containers, even during inte-\ngration of the satellite into the launcher fairing. To\nverify that the satellite successfully survived the entire\ntransport, some key performance tests including bat-\ntery conditions are repeated before integration of the\nsatellite with the launcher.\n\nMonitoring of the basic performance parameters\nis continued while the satellite is waiting for launch.\nIn case of irregularities in these key satellite para-\nmeters, the countdown can be suspended until a few\nminutes (6 minutes for Ariane) before liftoff at any\n\nCHO8.indd 737\n\n737\n\ntime, as soon as the satellite mission director declares\nthe satellite to be in a \u201cno-go\u201d condition. One of the\ncharacteristics of navigation satellites is that they can\nonly demonstrate their full 3D positioning fleet per-\nformance when at least four satellites are visible from\na location on Earth. Compliance with specifications\nand the correct functioning of each satellite are the\nnecessary preconditions for the Galileo system. This\nis confirmed as soon as the joint ranging performance\nof all satellites contributes constructively to a posi-\ntion and navigation solution with an accuracy that\ncomplies with the mission specification [8.6.1]. This\nlast test is the key test for the proof of concept, thus\nvalidating the correctness of the entire system concept.\nWhen this last hurdle is surmounted, validating the\ncorrect interoperation of ground and space segments,\nthe deployment of all the remaining satellites will\ncommence, after which the declaration of full ope-\nrational capability (FOC) of the Galileo system will\nestablish the beginning of regular services.\n\nBibliography\n\n8.6.1 Galileo Mission Requirements Document (GMRD),\n\nIssue 6.0.

To name only a few, the\n\nlegendary Tower of Babel, the Pyramids of Gizeh, the\n\nGreat Wall of China and Gothic cathedrals should\n\nbe recalled. All these ventures had the following in\n\ncommon:\n\ne Astrong and untiring political will\n\ne Achallenging and complex task\n\ne The long duration of their realization \u2014 decades\nor even centuries.\n\nEven with today\u2019s knowledge and criteria, the efforts\ninvested by these former architects and builders in\ncoordinating and mastering the processes involved are\nmore than remarkable. They were unique and even\ntoday are partially unknown.\n\nThe development of space technologies in the\n1950s and 1960s had similar attributes. These can be\nillustrated by the Apollo program:\n\ne Political goals in the Cold War between the USA\nand the former Soviet Union\n\ne The complexity and difficulty of a human mission\nto the Moon\n\ne Interdisciplinary and intercultural cooperation.\n\nAnd in contrast to former enterprises there were:\n\ne Stringent and timely requirements\n\ne Strict requirements for safety and the protection\nof human life and health\n\ne Limited or controllable risks during realization.\n\nFrom the experience gained in several realized pro-\ngrams, including their successes and failures, and\nusing the Apollo missions as an example, it has be-\ncome evident that such missions can only be carried\nout successfully with a consistent, well-directed and\ncoordinated management approach.

The present space\nindustry is able to make use of an increasing pool of\nexperience, documented in various international and\nindustrial standards.\n\nWhile the success of former space missions was\nprimarily oriented along technology lines and per-\nformance values, nowadays success is more and more\nmeasured by profit considerations and value for\nmoney. The definition of project tasks is changing\nfrom the management and execution of development\nprograms to the realization of economical enterprises,\nin particular the production of assets based on known\nand qualified processes and methods.\n\nThis makes it evident that the expectations of\na space mission are no longer limited to the fulfill-\nment of technical and scientific requirements. Due\nto the tight and limited budgets of public authorities,\nconsumers, agencies and institutions, the profita-\nbility of a program and its management approach\ntoward accomplishing the project goals within the\nrequested time and cost frame are also of essential\nimportance.\n\nSuccess or failure of a program will to a lesser\nextent be determined by its technical challenges than\nby its management accomplishments. Many failed or\ncollapsed programs may be due rather to mismanage-\nment than to failure to meet technical challenges.\n\nThis conflict can be illustrated by the Cluster sa-\ntellites, which should have been launched into orbit\nafter their successful manufacture and qualification\nwith the first launch of the Ariane 5 rocket. Though\nthe launch failed for technical reasons, public opi-\nnion judged the failure to be caused by the wrong\nmanagement decision to launch the four satellites\nusing a newly developed and not finally qualified\nlauncher.\n\nThe reverse conclusion is that successful project\nmanagement determines the success of a program.\nWhat are the success factors for successful project\nmanagement and what are the tasks?\n\nThese questions will be discussed and illustrated\nbelow.

Basically the profile is divided into\nthree parts and includes capabilities and competences\nin the following areas:\n\ne Functional, technical, product-oriented (technical\ncompetence)\n\ne Management know-how, methodology, process\nknowledge (methodological competence)\n\ne Interaction with people, leadership, communica-\ntion behavior (social competence).\n\nOnly a sound balance between the areas of compe-\ntence vis-a-vis the project partners and their interests\nwill guarantee a successful project.\n\nWhat are these areas of interest and what are the\ntasks of the project partners? With respect to these\nquestions Table 9.1.1 provides a generic overview of\ntypical project management tasks.\n\nIt is noteworthy that all the tasks of the project\npartners are on the one hand specified and defined\nwithin the contract, and on the other hand should\n\nCHO9.indd Sect:742 \u00a9\n\nseamlessly complement each other. The interests of\n\nthe parties, however, may conflict and accordingly\n\ninfluence and disturb homogeneous project execution.\n\nFor example:\n\ne The desire of the contractor to achieve a product\nof the best quality with a minimum investment of\nresources with respect to the budget and available\ntime.\n\ne The desire of the contractor to maximize profit\nand return on investment during project execu-\ntion.\n\ne The desire of the project team to maintain an\neven distribution of workload during project\nexecution.\n\nMost of these are certainly incomplete and imprecise;\nhowever, they illustrate what must be considered by\nproject management for a successful project execu-\ntion.\n\nWhile the social competence of the project mana-\nger is important for balancing the individual interests\nof the project partners, the manager\u2019s technical and\nmethodological competence is essential for the suc-\ncessful execution of the project for the benefit of all\npartners.\n\nThe quality of the deliverable product as defined\nby the requirements of the procurement contract\n\n2/25/09 3:36:25 PM\n",

The responsibility associated\nwith the project management task explains not only\nits attraction, but also its challenges (Figure 9.1.4).\n\nIn reality, projects are commonly characterized by\ncomplex structures and multilayered task descriptions,\ncombined with the risk that bad subtask solutions\nor minor changes may cause dramatic follow-up\nproblems.\n\nProject management must therefore focus on\na system-oriented approach and take into account\nsystems-level technical relationships: \u201cThinking in\nsystems, the holistic view, is an effective approach\ninherent in project management\u201d. It is supported\nby system engineering management as a comple-\nmentary subdiscipline to avoid the related project\nrisks.\n\nIn large projects, a major part of the traditional\ntasks of project management may be transferred to\nthe system engineer, who integrates all the techni-\ncal engineering disciplines and capabilities into a\nconsistent, team-orientated, structured process and\nefficiently supports and complements the work of\nthe project manager.\n\nIn Figure 9.1.5 the competence profile of a project\nmanager versus the size or scope of a project is shown\nin a qualitative manner.

This detailed plan-\nning is the baseline for the control tasks of project\nmanagement.\n\nThis becomes critical if, as is usual in space\nprograms, several project parties, organizations or\ncompanies are involved and must be guided and\ncontrolled.\n\nReality shows, however, that the necessary plan-\nning effort is often minimized or even neglected.\nExcuses are typically: \u201cThe management responsible\nalready knows what to do\u201d in the case of smaller pro-\njects; or for bigger projects, \u201cPlanning uncertainties\nare still too high because of expected changes.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the efforts of management services\nmust be efficiently tailored for economic reasons. This\nleads on the one hand to different expectations of the\ncompetence of project management (see Figure 9.1.5)\nand on the other hand to formal consideration of the\ncontent and scope of all tasks (see Section 9.1.4).\n\nThis conflict between the necessity for detailed\nplanning and the tailoring of needs can only be solved\nby applying systematic and sequential procedural me-\nthods which relate to the specific characteristics of the\nspace project or the deliverable space product.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that \u201cworking-level\u201d\nproject view is taken and that the so-called top-\ndown approach is used for the planning and related\nchanges, taking into consideration the life cycle of\nthe product.\n\nFor better understanding, a complete project cycle\nwill be discussed below, starting with the initial deve-\nlopment of a concept and ending with fulfillment of\nthe project goal or the use of the product.\n\nThe nature of a project may differ, being either a\ndevelopment or a pure procurement program. While\nprocurement programs make use of commercially\navailable and qualified goods and processes with ade-\nquate heritage of demonstrating their functionality in\nspace missions, development programs may require\nadditional process steps and effort.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:745\n\n745\n\nCommercially based programs are normally as-\nsociated with the procurement of communications\nsatellites, ground stations and appropriate operational\ncapabilities. Development programs are normally\nassociated with the development and manufacturing\nof satellites with new technologies or new functional\nperformance.\n\nIn particular the model philosophy, determining\namong other things the number of models to be\nmanufactured as well as the contents of verification\nmeasures, may be seen as a compromise between\neffort/costs and acceptable program risks.\n\nCommercial procurements commonly accept\nknown risks for the benefit of smaller investment.\n\nThe correlation (in principle) between effort and\nrisk is shown in Figure 9.1.6.\n\n9.1.2.1 Processes in Space Technology\n\nAll processes between mission definition and ope-\nration or use of a product are subject to a common\nlogic, which may be seen as a system approach. It is\nschematically presented in Figure 9.1.7.\n\nIn this closed loop the customer initiates the\nproject by providing sufficient financial resources\nand delegates responsibility for the project to the\nmain contractor through contractual regulations and\ntechnical procedures.

The roles and re-\n\nsponsibilities may be distributed among internal or\nexternal partners.\n\nThis understanding, based on modern quality\nmanagement approaches, assures a harmonic balance\nof interests in successful projects and is essential for\nthe following reasons:\n\ne The Customer\u2019s Shared Responsibility: The cu-\n\nstomer has to define the requirements and expec-\ntations as clearly as possible and has to provide\nreasonable and sufficient financial resources. This\nsounds trivial but, as a matter of fact, it is often the\nsubject of misunderstanding or even legal disputes\nin cases of wrong or incomplete definitions and\nrequirements.\nOften those deficiencies lead to suspension of a\nproject or even to bankruptcy of a contractual\npartner. In any case this will have effects on the\nquality of the product and will influence the satis-\nfaction of the customer or user.\nThe customer is therefore advised to offer assis-\ntance in all project phases to jointly reach the\nmission goals, to review and control its status and\nprogress, and to accept the final result or product\nafter positive evaluation. Related payments must be\nresult oriented and initiated in a timely manner.\n\ne The Responsibility of the Contractor: The\ncontractor\u2019s management has to carefully review\nthe tasks using internal guidelines and must con-\ntractually confirm the cost and time frame for the\nplanned implementation. It has to be assured that\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\ninternal resources are available and that quality\nstandards are applied for executing the project.\nQuite frequently different understandings of what\nconstitutes project realization lead to extensive\ntechnical or even private divergences between the\ninvolved parties and in consequence to qualita-\ntively weak project performance.\n\nThe Integrity of all Subprocesses: The overall pro-\ngram consists of multiple processes which have to\nbe carried out and concluded individually. All pro-\ncesses must complement each other and fulfill the\noverall project goal. Those responsible for a process\nand the respective tools must be available without\nrestrictions to support the project manager.\nIntermediate processes must be reviewed and\naccepted at formal reviews and milestones. Depar-\ntures from this understanding lead in most cases\nto work overloads as well as to resource and cost\nproblems.\n\nThe Value-Adding Process: Value-adding proces-\nses must be clearly defined. It must be assured that\nproducts or services comply with requirements\nand are acceptable by the customer at the end of\nthe implementation process for all life cycles.\nWrong or insufficient understanding often leads\nto undesirable results with consequences for\ncosts and the schedule. Overdesign caused by the\ndesigner\u2019s own ideas has to be avoided.\n\nThe Satisfaction of the Customer: Customer\nsatisfaction is primarily achieved when tasks are\nperformed in compliance with planning and re-\nquirements, and secondarily when the customer\u2019s\nexpectations and goals are fulfilled (see Table 9.1.3\nbelow).\n\nContractors must carefully and systematically plan\nthe needed processes and execute them transpa-\nrently. This aspect is of considerable importance\nbecause \u201cbadly\u201d performing projects can often be\ntraced back to deficient understanding of how\ncustomer satisfaction is to be achieved.\n\nThe Overall Task of Project Management: Project\nmanagement must be regarded as a central con-\ntact point where monitoring and control of the\nentire value-adding process take place. It must be\n\n2/25/09 3:36:28 PM\n",

Only com-\nprehensive consideration of so-called closed loop\nprocess understanding leads to a classic \u201cwin-win\u201d\nsituation for all project partners.\n\nHowever, for the authorities, institutions and compa-\nnies involved in many space projects, it is normal for\nthe most important processes and management tasks\nto be strictly regulated and controlled by dedicated\nquality management systems according to ISO 9001,\nISO EN 9100 or ECSS.\n\nThese are applied during the individual phases of\nthe life cycle of a space project, which are characte-\nrized as:\n\ne Conception\n\ne Definition and tasking\n\ne Design and development\n\ne Manufacturing and commissioning\ne Acceptance\n\ne Operation\n\ne Disposal.\n\nThis is also valid for components and subsystems\nwhich are assembled and integrated into the systems.\nFor economic reasons this system approach has\nto accept phase overlaps and \u201cworkaround\u201d solutions\n(Figure 9.1.8).

In order to maintain the nee-\nded balance between experienced contractors and\ntheir own management, customers often integrate\n\n751\n\nindependent experts (consultants) onto their team\nto monitor and control the program with them.\nCustomers commonly understand their business as\none of service providers offering satellite or system\ncapabilities to their clienteles.\n\nTherefore it is not surprising that in the customers\u2019\nor clienteles\u2019 view the provision, operation and use of\na complex satellite system is seen as a single procure-\nment which is evaluated as an essential aspect of their\nenvisaged business model.\n\nThe execution of a procurement program is\nconceptually different from the phased approach\nof ESA for development programs. It consists of\nfive phases from the beginning (feasibility study)\nuntil system handover and use by the customer (see\nFigure 9.1.12).\n\nPhase 1 Feasibility Study\n\ne Investigation of existing technical know-how and\nmarket potential\n\ne Development of a business model\n\ne Development of technology solutions including\nboundary conditions\n\n\u00a9 Cost and economic concepts\n\ne Evaluation of risk factors.\n\nPhase 2 Request for Information Phase (RFI)\n\ne Description of planned procurement by the\ncustomer\n\ne Acknowledgment of interest in tendering by the\nbidder industry with\n- Preliminary cost and time estimates\n- Draft system concepts\n- Information about experience and heritage\n\ne Development or validation of evaluation processes\nincluding software to be used during assessment\nand evaluations\n\ne Evaluation of RFI from several bidders.\n\nNo. | Process title Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3| Year 4] Year5| [Year 18|Year 19 Yea|\n\nFeasibility study\n\nRequest for information (RFP) phase\nRequest for proposal (RFP) phase\nProduction phase\n\nOperations and maintenance\nDisposal\n\nFigure 9.1.12: Typical implementation flow for the procurement of a commercial satellite system.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:751\n\n2/25/09 3:36:31 PM\n",

Based on the specific product tree,\nthe established processes of the companies and the\navailable resources and capabilities, the tasks, costs and\nschedules required to fulfill the mission goals must be\nplanned. Project management must consider the main\naspects described below.\n\nProject Structure (Work Flow Plan)\n\nThe objective of a work breakdown structure (WBS)\nis to structure the project in reasonable and effective\nwork packages to be distributed among the involved\nproject partners, as well as to define the implementa-\ntion phases or component groups. On the basis of the\nWBS, depending on the complexity of the program,\nconcrete and reliable cost and schedule plans can be\ndeveloped and integrated into the proposals.\n\nIn Figure 9.1.14 a typical WBS for a satellite pro-\ngram is shown. Each block represents a specific task\n(work package) to be performed by a responsible team\nmember.

Project\nmanagement is successful if the goals and objectives\nwith respect to technical specifications, as well as to\ncosts and time schedules, are met and recognized by\nthe customer as being successful. This requires the\nestablishment of management processes using suitable\nmethods of planning, organization, control, results\nevaluation and analyses, and the immediate initiati-\non of corrective measures or changes to achieve the\noverall goals of the project.\n\nThus, technical and methodological skills, but in\nparticular also the social competence of the project\nmanager, have an essential role:\n\ne Project management is more often apt to fail\nbecause of erroneous decisions than because of\nmethodological shortcomings.\n\ne Unfortunately, failures are persistently repeated,\nfollowed by a firm resolution to avoid them in\nthe next project.\n\nWhile technical competence often establishes the\npreconditions for assigning project management\nresponsibilities to candidates, less attention is paid\nto their methodological and social competences.

Quality\nmanagement looks after the management and main\nprocesses within the organization and is responsible\nfor the implementation and verification of customer\nrequirements and the quality policy for all products\n\nand projects. It must have sufficient independence\nto perform this control function both neutrally and\nobjectively. This can be achieved by organizational\nimplementation as a cross-functional responsibility\nwithin the organizational structure and by having\nquality management reports sent directly to the head\nof the organization.\n\nQuality management must have the goals of\npreventing any product failures, optimizing the\norganization\u2019s processes, and providing the long-term\nproduct quality which assures customer satisfaction.\n\n2/25/09 3:36:41 PM\n",

A prerequisite is a\nhigh sense of responsibility on the part of all emplo-\nyees in carrying out and evaluating their work and in\nassuring the continuous implementation of corrective\nmeasures.\n\nThe effectiveness of a quality management system\nrequires an analysis of how processes are organized.\nWhen it is established it is essential that information\nflow, staff involvement, interrelationships and wor-\nking conditions be clearly identified. Afterward, the\norganizational structure, functional and disciplinary\nresponsibilities, and the responsibilities of individual\nemployees, can be defined.\n\nThe terms, tasks and responsibilities referred to in\nthis section are defined and discussed below.\n\n9.2.1 Terms\n\nQuality management, quality assurance and product\nassurance are terms which are often used in parallel,\nbut they describe different tasks.\n\nQuality Management\n\nQuality management (QM) implements the generic\n\nand obligatory ISO quality standards in the organi-\n\nzation\u2019s processes, and maintains its quality policy,\n\nmanuals, procedures, facilities and resources.\nQuality management is responsible for the fol-\n\nlowing:\n\ne Translation of the organization\u2019s quality policy\ninto projects and products\n\ne Checking its processes, manuals and procedures\n\n\u00a9 Certification and qualification of its facilities\nand personnel\n\ne Definition of parameters and evaluation of custo-\nmer satisfaction\n\ne Auditing of suppliers, supplier ratings and quality\nacknowledgment\n\ne Internal auditing and maintenance of technical\nprocess qualifications\n\ne Maintaining the quality of equipment and faci-\nlities\n\ne Supply of norms and standards\n\ne Establishment of quality control loops\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:769\n\n769\n\ne Implementation of risk management related to\nquality.\n\nQuality Assurance\n\nQuality assurance (QA) is the operational and control-\nling function of quality management. It converts the\nrules of quality management into the product-specific\nprocesses needed for product generation. Quality as-\nsurance monitors all hardware and software life cycles\nduring product generation. This includes assuring the\ntraceability of design development, production and\nqualification of a product, including the associated\nproduct documentation, up until formal acceptance\nand delivery to the customer.\n\nOther tasks concern the selection and approval\nof manufacturers and suppliers, the handling of\ndeviations and defects, as well as failure and change\nmanagement.\n\nQuality assurance is responsible for the fol-\nlowing:\n\ne Planning quality assurance measures for the\nproduct generation process\n\ne Definition of and adherence to product quality\nstandards\n\ne Transfer of quality requirements into specifica-\ntions and work statements\n\ne Preparation of product-associated quality plans\nand work instructions\n\ne Availability of product-associated facilities and\nequipment\n\ne Verification of product-associated customer requi-\nrements\n\ne Implementation of quality controls, acceptances\nand certification\n\ne Preparation and maintenance of the product-as-\nsociated quality documentation.\n\nQuality assurance follows a generic task sequence,\nas below.\n\nPlanning of Quality\n\nQuality planning includes the definition of quality\ntargets for a given product and the measures for their\npermanent monitoring (analytical QA). This planning\nis supplemented by preventive measures which assure\nthe maintenance of quality (constructive QA). This\nplanning requires the following:\n\n2/25/09 3:36:42 PM\n",

Analysis of these measurements leads to\nimprovements in the constructive QA.\n\nGuidance of Quality\n\nThe guidance of quality regulates the provisioning of\nresources (employees and material) on the basis of\nplanning and quality measurements.\n\nControl of Quality\n\nQuality is controlled using uniform evaluation\ncriteria based on the evaluation of indicators (see\nSection 9.2.2.3). A prerequisite is the formalization\nof process procedures, documents and document\ntemplates. This is not to be understood as bureau-\ncratization, but as a measure which guarantees the\nobjectivity of the quality assurance processes.\n\nProduct Assurance\nQuality assurance for space products is referred to as\nproduct assurance (PA).\n\nProduct assurance translates generic quality assu-\nrance into space-specific processes needed for pro-\nduct generation. These processes are oriented to the\nrules and regulations of customer organizations such\nas ESA, NASA, DLR, as well as those of launcher aut-\nhorities and user organizations such as Arianespace,\nCOSMOS, METEOSAT, SES and ASTRA. Product\nassurance supports project management in carrying\nout the product life cycle and supervising product\ngeneration according to the customer\u2019s programmatic\nand technical requirements, and based on experience\nand lessons learned.\n\nThe tasks of space-specific product assurance are\nbeyond the generic quality assurance tasks and there-\nfore require a dedicated, task-oriented organizational\nstructure (see Figure 9.2.2 below).\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\n9.2.2 Requirements and Premises\n\n9.2.2.1 Requirements\n\nThe general requirements for quality management\nresult from an interpretation of the requirements\nspecified in one or more standards such as EN ISO\n9001, EN ISO 9100 or their equivalent. These are\ncomplemented by customer-specific requirements,\nrequirements for technology processes, as well as by\ndirect or indirect rules and regulations under the\nlaws of those countries and communities in which\nthe product is to be used. The customer-specific re-\nquirements of major space agencies are summarized\nin Section 9.2.6.4.\n\n9.2.2.2 Quality Policy and Quality Goals\n\nThe quality of products and services forms the basis\nof the organization\u2019s success.\n\nIn order to assure and maintain a high level of\nquality, management usually defines its quality goals\nas:\n\ne Optimized customer satisfaction on a fair part-\nnership basis\n\ne Failure prevention instead of failure correction\n(zero-failure goal).\n\nQuality policy and targets are explicitly defined in\nthe annual business plan in the form of indicators\nwhich must be announced and communicated to all\nmanagement levels.\n\n9.2.2.3 Quality Indicators\n\nQuality indicators are organization- or customer-\nassociated indicators appropriate for evaluating or\ndefining product quality.\n\nQuality indicators can be statistical numbers pro-\nvided by the organization, project control, quality\nmanagement, or from production controls. When\nevaluating such indicators it is essential to take into\naccount the relative complexity and comparability of\nproducts. The comparison should therefore only be\nperformed within a specific group of product systems,\nsubsystems, units, or components.\n\nTo confirm adherence to the quality targets, the\nindicators listed in Table 9.2.1 may be used.\n\n2/25/09 3:36:43 PM\n",

The\nsupervision of all processes including outsourced ex-\nternal processes is under the responsibility of quality\nmanagement.\n\n9.2.3 The Product Main Processes\n\nBesides the management and quality management\nprocesses, specific space product main processes\nare shown in Figure 9.2.1. In this figure the quality\nmanagement procedures indicate the correlation of\napplicable quality control procedures.\n\n9.2.3.1 Marketing and Proposal Submission\n\nAll product requirements are described by the custo-\nmer ina statement of work (SOW) and/or in product\nspecifications. Such specifications describe the mis-\nsion requirements, the technical requirements, the\nmanagement requirements, the quality requirements\nand the customer project standards applicable for\nproduct realization and verification.\n\nThese requirements will be checked following the\norganization\u2019s relevant procedure before incorporati-\non into a product proposal. It is important for product\nrealization within the specified cost and time frame\nto havea very early declaration of the required model\nphilosophy. This has a direct impact on the planning\nfor procurement qualification, material and compo-\nnent costs. Therefore it is mandatory that as part of\nthe proposal phase, all costs and procurement times\nfor the different product models be assessed.\n\nIf the procurement is not possible within the\nproject schedule, secondary procurement sources\nmust be considered and alternatives negotiated with\nthe customer.\n\nFor software development, either internal or exter-\nnal, adequate qualifications and acceptances must be\nconsidered. Special regard must be given to additional\ncosts for software test tools and a test environment.\n\n9.2.3.2 Predevelopment and Development\n\nAny product development is described in a develop-\nment plan which summarizes the development steps\nvia the different product models, the procurement\n\n2/25/09 3:36:44 PM\n",

The selection\ncan be either from an existing supplier list provi-\nded by the major space agencies, or on the basis of\nspecific technology requirements. For the selection\nand assignment of suppliers, special concern is given\nto their ISO certification and their ability to meet\ncustomer requirements. In case of any doubts as to\ntheir adequacy, or in the case of a new supplier, a sup-\nplier audit is conducted by quality management. The\naudit results are reported to the customer on request.\nSupplier audits must always be completed before the\nawarding of a contract.\n\nPart of the audit is checking the supplier\u2019s compli-\nance with the generic quality requirements of the ISO\nstandards, the product requirements and the supplier's\nqualification to carry out specified technological\nprocesses.

These are accommodated\nby the contractor in the form of a design specification\nfor the system, the subsystems, the operations and\nthe associated work package descriptions (WPD). It\nis essential that all requirements be completely iden-\ntified, collected and documented before the contract.\nThey are contractually committing and must be expli-\ncitly verified until the project comes to an end.\n\nThe specifications contain the design require-\nments, operational requirements, environmental\nrequirements, quality standards for parts, materials\nand components, as well as the deliverable product\nmodels. The requirements must be broken down to\nall product levels, as system, subsystem, equipment\nand component levels. Special concerns have to be\naddressed concerning the functional and physical\ninterfaces between these levels, the payload and the\ninterface in human space projects. Incomplete, unclear\nor contradicting requirements must be negotiated\nwith the customer before the project starts.\n\n9.2.6.6 Selection of Quality Standards\n\nThe selection of appropriate quality standards is pri-\nmarily oriented along the functional requirements, the\nenvironmental loads and the predicted operational\nlifetime. The standards may differ, depending on the\nmaintenance concepts, especially for human space\nproducts. The quality standards differ for the required\nproduct models, of which the flight model has the\nhighest quality standards.\n\nAdditional selection criteria derive from the reli-\nability and availability requirements and the chosen\nredundancy concept. In the case of sufficient redun-\ndancies the quality standards for components may be\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:785\n\n785\n\nreduced, but on the other hand they may have to be\nincreased in the case of insufficient redundancies. All\nselected quality standards must be checked by product\nassurance and documented in compliance lists.\n\n9.2.6.7 Product Model Philosophy\n\nThe definition of the model philosophy is especially\nimportant for product development and production.\nIt has a direct impact on qualification planning, pro-\ncurement planning and hardware cost. The selected\nquality standards must be related to the different\nproduct models. Model hardware cost and hardware\nprocurement sources as well as the procurement time\nhave to be identified early in the project proposal\nphase. In order to meet the project schedule it is in\nany case recommended that alternative hardware\nprocurement sources be identified.\n\nEngineering (Qualification) Model and Flight\nModel\n\nFor this \u201ctwo-model\u201d philosophy the engineering\nmodel (EM) serves as a development model which\nis identical to the flight model (FM) in form, fit and\nfunction. In exceptional and reasonable cases it is\npermissible to use lower quality standards for EEE\ncomponents. Therefore the failure risk is relatively\nhigh but controllable. The EM is used for flight qua-\nlification testing (EQM) including environmental\ntesting. Design improvements, modifications and\nrepairs are allowed.\n\nThe subsequent FM is a reproduction of the qua-\nlified EM but with flight-standard hardware. The FM\nundergoes acceptance testing with lower testing levels\nthan for the EQM.

Experience from an upstream EQM does\nnot exist, which increases the failure risk until func-\ntional testing on the integrated system level. The risk\nduring environmental tests with a combined qualifi-\ncation/acceptance level is controllable because of the\nprevious qualification-level tests on the component,\nequipment and subsystem levels.\n\nFailure probability and total risk are explicitly\nhigher than the risk associated with the \u201ctwo-model\u201d\nphilosophy.\n\n9.2.6.8 Project Milestones\n\nMonitoring the product life cycle is defined contrac-\ntually and is performed by specified project milestone\nreviews.

The risk policy\nfor the company assures that the risk inventory and\nestimation will be performed for business processes\nand survival risks on a regular basis.\n\nBusiness risks must be identified by forewarning\nindicators and thresholds for the organization\u2019s main\nprocesses. Identification is supported by the use of the\nquality indicators.\n\nRisk management assures the implementation of\ncontrol processes and corrective action in order to\navoid or reduce risk. A risk is any event that can have a\nnegative impact on the business or the product, with a\ncertain probability of occurrence, as well as any future\nevent on which the impact is not presently known.\n\nThe risk management process must be described\nin a separate risk management plan which essentially\nconsists of the following activities.\n\nRisk Identification: The first step in risk manage-\nment is to identify all individual risks that can affect\nthe project\u2019s objectives in terms of cost, schedule and\ntechnical performance. The definition of the risk\nscenario presupposes the assumption of all possible\nevents impacting the product negatively (i.e., the\nnonachievement of product objectives) and the asso-\nciated potential causes of those risks.\n\nRisk Assessment: The purpose of this step is\nto determine the magnitude of the individual risks\nand to rank them with respect to cost, schedule and\ntechnical performance. The magnitude of risk is\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\ncalculated as the product of a probability score and\na severity score.\n\nA risk mitigation table details the criteria used to\nevaluate the probability of occurrence and the con-\nsequent severity of an event identified as a risk item\nfor the program.\n\nRisk Reduction: The ultimate purpose of risk\nmanagement is to reduce the magnitude of risk by\nproper mitigating actions in order to achieve the\nproduct\u2019s objectives; it involves revising the project\nschedule, budget, scope or quality.\n\nRisk Monitoring: The purpose of this step is to ob-\nserve the monitoring process and corrective actions.\n\nCommunication and Acceptance: The purpose\nof this step is to track, monitor, update, iterate and\ncommunicate the risks in order to manage them.\n\n9.2.8 Configuration Management\n\nConfiguration management (CM) is the progress-\noriented management and audit of requirement and\ndesign documentation data files, and of the items\nproduced.\n\nCM processes are applied for:\n\ne Hardware product configuration\n\ne Software product configuration\n\ne Documentation.\n\nThe main objectives of CM are coordination and\n\nsynchronization of distributed development and main-\n\ntaining control over the product life cycle and the\n\nmaintenance of product consistency despite various\n\nplanned or unplanned changes. CM provides a metho-\n\ndical approach by applying methods for:\n\ne A well-structured product breakdown and refe-\nrence configurations\n\ne An unequivocal definition of design-to, produce\n-to, test-to and operate-to documentation and\nproducts\n\ne Effective and efficient change management for\nactive control\n\ne Status accounting and reporting for progress\njudgment and monitoring\n\ne The minimization of administrative activities by\ncentralized approaches\n\ne Anassurance that everyone working on the project\n(including subcontractors) at any time is using the\n\n2/25/09 3:37:03 PM\n",

Each identified\nnon-conformance, for instance manufacturing fail-\nures, must be reported in a nonconformance report\n(NCR) for evaluation by project management. Design\ncorrections or repairs must be documented in the\nassociated product documentation, drawings and\nprocedures.\n\nNon-conformance is an apparent or proven condi-\ntion of any item or documentation that does not meet\nthe specified requirements. In addition, any apparent\nor proven condition of any item or documentation\nwhich is considered likely to lead to incorrect opera-\ntion or failure of the item or mission must be treated\nas nonconformance. The term non-conformance is\nalso used for failures, discrepancies, defects, anomalies,\nmalfunctions and deficiencies.\n\nNon-conformances affecting product perfor-\nmance, costs, schedules or an applicable requirement\nare generally classified as \u201cmajor.\u201d\n\nFor major NCRs leading to a permanent violation\nof a specified requirement, a request for waiver (RFW)\nmust be issued and submitted for customer approval.\nDetails must be reported to the customer together\nwith the information that the product concerned will\nnot fulfill the specifications in the baseline configura-\ntion of the identification documentation.\n\nFailure management is part of the product-\ndedicated CM plan.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:791\n\n791\n\nChange management controls all product changes\nduring design development, production and qualifi-\ncation. Change management must be described in a\ncompany manual and in a product-specific change\nmanagement plan. Each product baseline change\nrequested or proposed by the customer, prime con-\ntractor, subcontractor or supplier has to be registered\nand checked formally for:\n\ne Need/reason for change\n\ne Description of the change\n\ne Name of the initiator, organization, date\n\ne Change effect (for configuration items, docu-\nments, products)\n\ne Urgency/schedule impact\n\ne Proposed class of the change.\n\nIf a change has been approved the appropriate conse-\nquential actions must be initiated and controlled by\nchange management until final release of the modified\nitems. Product assurance verifies compliance for final\nclose-out.\n\nChange management is part of the product-de-\ndicated CM plan.\n\n9.2.10 Requirement Verification\n\nThe verification of product requirements is a com-\nbined activity of project management and quality\nmanagement. Verification is the controlled process\nfor certifying specified requirements as specified in\nwritten product specifications. Together with the sys-\ntem specification, the following verification methods\nmust be assigned, associated to the selected model\n\nphilosophy:\n\ne Review of Design (RoD)\ne Analysis (A)\n\ne Test (T)\n\ne Inspection (I)\ne Similarity (S).\n\nDepending on the validity of a product requirement,\none or more verification methods may apply. In cer-\ntain cases two verification methods may apply: for\nexample, requirement verification by \u201canalysis\u201d will\nalso be verified by a test, or \u201creview of design\u201d will be\napproved by hardware \u201cinspection.\u201d\n\n2/25/09 3:37:03 PM\n",

It\nis therefore important to assess from an early stage\nthe payment plans, actual expenditures, risks and\nopportunities. Well-implemented cost management\nadditionally facilitates the prediction of variations as\nwell as the definition and implementation of correc-\ntive measures to avoid cost increases. Through the\nforecast of payment flows, cost management smoothes\nthe progress of budget planning and focuses the view\non payment commitments.\n\nThe method of using cost as an independent de-\nsign variable (CAIV) has a major impact on product\n\n2/25/09 3:37:05 PM\n",

Total costs, cost\ntrends, as well as potential risks and opportunities play\nan important role in the decision-making process on\ntactical and strategic levels.\n\n9.3.2 Objective\n\nThe general objective of cost management is to ensure\n\nan effective and proactive project control process.\n\nCost management establishes the overall planning\n\nbaseline for work and costs over the course of a pro-\n\nject and allocates them to the different stakeholders.\n\nThis creates a common understanding among all the\n\nproject participants about the costs and work effort\n\ninvolved.\n\nBecause of a strong interrelationship between\nschedule and cost management, both tasks are inte-\ngrated most of the time in project control. Given this\nsituation, the main objectives of cost management are\ndefined as follows:\n\ne Accurate planning and coordination of procure-\nment activities, expenses and resources in a pro-\nject.\n\ne Detecting cost deviations during project execu-\ntion and making timely recommendations for\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\ncorrective actions with the aim of completing the\nproject within the schedule and budget.\n\nFurthermore, these objectives are to be achieved in\na proactive manner, thus neutralizing negative cost\ntrends as soon as possible. The importance of these\nobjectives is evident when considering the typical\nlife cycle cost trend of a space project, as shown in\nFigure 9.3.1. This figure shows that total project cost\nis to a large extent already determined in the early\nproject phases. The potential to influence project cost\ndecreases rapidly with the progress of a project, lea-\nving less than 20% of the potential to influence when\nthe detailed design starts. Any greater modification\nintroduced at that point \u2014 even if intended to save\ncost \u2014 would result in total project cost increases and\nmost probably would delay the project.\n\nTherefore, cost management is most important\nat the beginning of a project in the mission concept\nphase when the greatest potential exists to effectively\ninfluence project cost. This leads to the insight that:\n\nCost management is more a design function than\nan administrative function.\n\nConsequently, cost management is considered\nto be an engineering function represented by the\ndiscipline of cost engineering.\n\nFigure 9.3.1: Life cycle\n\ncosts (commitment and Mission concept | Feasibility study/ | Definition phase | Detailed design &\ncumulative) during the pre-phase A or | conceptual design phase B production phase\nproject phases. phase 0 phase A phase C/D\n\n2/25/09 3:37:05 PM\n",

Initial analyses/estimates\nof potential project costs, which are derived from\nparametric system cost models, are required for mis-\nsion analysis and feasibility studies (Phases 0 and A).\nDuring the continuous course of the project more\nprecise cost estimates, based on the subsystem or\nequipment level, are demanded. At this point more\naccurate cost estimation methods can be applied since\nmore detailed project information becomes known\nand available. Typically, more analytical methods are\nconsidered, while the number of costing iterations\ndepends mainly on the rate of change of the product\ndefinition. Normally a cost estimate update is required\nfor every major project review.\n\n9.3.3.2 Embedding into the Project Management\nCycle\n\nPart of the required cost management input is deri-\n\nved from the schedule management, as described in\n\nSection 9.1.

If allocated to the\ncountry/company structure (CCS) the geographical\nreturn can be planned.\n\nProject cost baseline and geographical return are\nconsidered the main inputs for the subsequent cost\ncontrol process since they constitute the planned\ncost flows within a project. These are compared to\nthe actual costs in the course of the project, which\nmakes it possible to identify performance deviations\nand evaluate project efficiency. Performance indices\nare calculated and then used to estimate cost at com-\npletion (EAC, Estimate At Completion) and cost to\ncomplete the project (ETC, Estimate To Complete).\nBoth EAC and ETC are deemed very important\nindicators for project management in preparing its\ndecisions.\n\nAll these indicators, indices and reports are re-\nquired to ensure systematic and robust project cost\nmanagement. Figure 9.3.3 depicts how this informa-\ntion is embedded in the cost management process.\n\n9.3.4 Tasks of Cost Management\n\n9.3.4.1 Cost estimating\n\nThe responsibility for managing complex, high-tech\nprograms which include a large proportion of new\ndevelopments highlights the importance of cost and\ninancial aspects, and in particular the difficulties\nassociated with estimating, assessing and control-\ning project costs. Costs and their generation are an\nimportant factor during the entire project life cycle\nand play a major role when assessing different options,\ncost/technical trade-offs, budgets, price proposals,\npreparations for contract negotiations and the impact\nof design changes.\n\nConsidering the progress of concentration in the\nspace industry, independent cost estimates (ICEs)\nhave become increasingly important. The lack of com-\npetition results more and more often in a single-offer\nsituation. This makes it very difficult for the customer\nto evaluate whether a price is justified. Obtaining an\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:797\n\n797\n\nindependent cost estimate can be a good basis for\nprice comparisons (benchmarking) by introducing\nprice targets (target pricing). This method provides\na \u201csecond\u201d opinion offering a more solid starting\nposition in negotiations. Consequently, independent\ncost estimates are frequently used to create a situation\nof virtual competition.\n\nAll cost elements with their associated influencing\nparameters have to be identified. The required cost\nelements vary with the industrial branch and the\nitem or system to be estimated. Elements typical of\nthe space industry and their key factors or influencing\nparameters are listed in Table 9.3.1.\n\nInput\n\nBefore starting the selection of the most appropriate\ncost estimate it has to be ensured that for each ele-\nment to be estimated information is available that is\nas detailed as possible.\n\nA well-populated database is the main basis for\nmost cost estimating and cost engineering activities.\nSuch a database includes cost data (e.g., cost at com-\npletion or at the time of proposal) together with the\nrespective technical (e.g., mass, power, performance,\n\nTable 9.3.1: Typical cost elements for space systems and their\neffects.\n\nCost element Key factor/influencing\n\nparameters\n\nEquipment Technology, representative\n\nparameters, model philosophy\n\nProject office Design effort, management, quality\n\nand product assurance\nVerification,\nintegration, test\n\nEffort for assembly, integration,\nverification and qualification\n\nGSE Machines, tools and jigs, etc.\nSpecific\nactivities\n\nSpecific tests (cryosystems),\nplanetary protection\n\nLaunch cost Launch preparation and integration,\n\nlauncher system\n\nOperations Operations concept, ground\nsegment\n\nCost risk Technical, programmatic, political\nproject risks\n\nProcurement Georeturn, procurement policy,\n\nmarket situation\n\n2/25/09 3:37:13 PM\n",

Furthermore, historic\nproject data is taken into account if a clear record is\navailable listing all price changes together with the\nassociated explanation for each WBS element.\n\nAdditional information can be stored to ensure\nthat the reference project can be understood and that\nimportant parameters influencing the estimation\nprocess, such as the industrial policy background at\nthe time of the project, can be considered.\n\nOther preparatory activities include a WBS analysis\nwith respect to the project work that will have to be per-\nformed. Also, it must be checked whether any activities\nhave been overlooked or listed more than once.\n\nThe identification of cost drivers is particularly\nimportant since they play a significant role in the\nchoice of the appropriate cost estimation method and\ncost model to be applied.\n\nA few important ECSS-based reference documents\nwhich should be consulted for purposes of cost control\nduring the cost estimation process and in the course\nof a project are explained below.\n\nStarting from the functional requirements in the\nform of a function tree (FT), the project breakdown\nstructure (PBS), derived directly from customer\nrequirements, follows. Such a PBS is the basis for a\ncommon understanding between the different groups\ninvolved in the project as to the definition of elements\nas well as the related tasks and resources. Furthermore,\nall responsibilities within the organizations as well\nas coordination and optimization of the required\nresources and operations are described.\n\nThe product tree (PT), which is developed as a\nnext step, contains the detailed definition of each\nsystem element.\n\nAs indicated in Figure 9.3.4, a description of the\nnecessary development and production processes\nproduces the WBS.\n\nWork Breakdown Structure\n\nThe WBS is an effective management tool supporting\nboth the customer and the supplier in fulfilling their\nbusiness obligations, while setting the framework for\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nregulating, planning and controlling costs, schedules\nand technical content.\n\nThe project is subdivided into manageable work\npackages (WPs) organized by the type of work to\nbe performed. All activities are identified in detail.\nThe WBS is derived from the product tree by expan-\nding its components with support functions (see\nFigure 9.3.4) provided by the contractor. Support\nfunctions are all those activities necessary to produce\nthe end product (e.g., project management, engi-\nneering, product assurance support). It should be\nmentioned that an end product can be a development,\nhardware (e.g., a flight model) or a service (such as\nmission operations).\n\nWork Package Description\n\nThe WPD is closely connected to the WBS.

It is applied to trace contrac-\ntual responsibilities and interface definitions, and if\nrequired can also be used to verify and monitor the\ngeographical distribution specified in the country/\ncompany structure (CCS) in the case of international\nprojects.\n\nRisk Register\n\nAs described in Section 9.1.4.3, potential risks to the\nproject are listed in the risk register and ranked by\ntheir impact, which is the product of the probability\nof occurrence and potential consequences. This infor-\nmation is very important for cost management since\nit is the basis for specifying the project cost risk and\nderiving a safety margin for the project budget.\n\nRisk management, which is closely connected to\nproject and cost management, has developed during\nthe last few years into a specific function for systema-\ntically identifying and analyzing project risks.\n\nRisk factors of particular interest for cost ma-\nnagement are for example programmatic parame-\nters, implementation of new technologies, specific\ncost drivers, financial (and eventually georeturn)\nconditions.\n\nProject Schedule\n\nCost and schedule management are closely linked in\nthe task of deriving a network plan from the WBS. The\nnetwork plan connects all activities with their logical\nrelations in a time sequence. Milestones, defining\nstart and end dates and/or required design reviews,\nare introduced into the timeline to provide a better\noverview. Identifying the critical path helps to anti-\ncipate developments which may require appropriate\ncorrective measures. Project timelines are generally\ndisplayed in a Gantt chart in which each activity is\nrepresented by a bar. The bar lengths indicates the\nduration and the logical relationships are symbolized\nby arrows.\n\nEconomic Conditions\n\nThe economic conditions can be understood as relating\nto a point in time to which all financial specification\nand information are compared. It is, so to speak, a\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nnorm and is important for calculating inflation costs\nat a later date. The information is typically put in the\nfollowing form: e.c. month year (e.c. Jan 2009).\n\nTechnology Readiness Level\n\nThe technology readiness level (TRL) serves as an\n\nindicator of technology maturity. It can be used\n\nto determine the following parameters, among\nothers:\n\ne To what extent are technologies, materials, tools,\nequipment, etc., already developed and availa-\nble?\n\ne Which qualification tests have been already per-\nformed and which are still outstanding?\n\ne What is the expected timeline?\n\ne Towhat order of magnitude do modifications have\nto be expected?\n\nTRLs are taken into account when assessing potential\nrisks concerning the costs and schedule. The generally\napplied TRL definitions are based on a NASA White\nPaper from 1995 [9.3.5].\n\nCost Estimation Requirements\nAll of the above-mentioned information necessary for\nthe cost estimation process is specified in the invitati-\non to tender and included in the list of deliverables.\n\nAll the data and information mentioned in the\nsections above form the basis for selecting the most\nappropriate cost estimate methodology. The choice\nof cost models and how they are constructed depends\nvery much on the basic assumptions, the procurement\nof adequate input data, the current and predicted pro-\nject phase(s), as well as suitable references. References\nare stored in specific databases and include relevant\ntechnical, programmatic as well as cost allocation\ninformation.\n\nDifferent cost estimation methods and models\nare described below.\n\nMethods/Models\n\nThere are different approaches and methods for\nestimating and assessing costs, all of which have\nadvantages and disadvantages under particular cir-\ncumstances. The most suitable methods are selected\nby considering the following:\n\ne Character of the activity to be costed or assessed.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:17 PM\n",
    "822": "9.3 Cost Management\n\ne The organization\u2019s experience with the system or\nactivity to be costed\n\ne The extent to which reference can be made to\nprevious exercises\n\ne The availability of reliable design information\n\ne The time available to prepare the estimate.\n\nOther selection aspects are the project phase in which\nthe estimate is to be performed and specific require-\nments concerning the cost details as well as the degree\nof accuracy required. Usually several methods are\napplied as a \u201cplausibility check\u201d to verify that the\nresults are valid. The most common approaches for\nestimating and assessing costs are presented next.\n\nExpert\u2019s Judgment or Wideband Delphi Method\nThis approach is used to derive a rough and rapid\nestimate of the order of magnitude of a cost. Its rele-\nvance is normally limited to specific areas and implies\nexpert judgment as well as close familiarity with the\nfield of activity. Such a \u201crule of thumb\u201d approximation\nis not very sophisticated, but it may be sufficiently\naccurate in certain circumstances when an estimate\nis required quickly.\n\nBottom-up Cost Estimate\n\nThis method derives detailed cost estimates at a re-\nlative low work package level of the WBS and is clo-\nsely connected with schedule planning and resource\nallocation. Due to the amount of detail, a bottom-up\nestimate is both time consuming and expensive. A\nprecondition for this method is good knowledge and\nan appropriate level of definition of the activities that\nhave to be estimated.\n\nAnalogy\n\nAn important condition for this commonly applied\nmethod is being able to ascertain the cost of previous\nactivities, elements or systems. Relevant historical data\nis used as a reference for predicting the cost of current\nitems. The method depends very much on the com-\npleteness and accuracy of the available information\nand on the extent to which technical, programmatic\nor economic differences between the reference and the\nelement to be estimated can be identified and utilized\nto normalize the database. Also, cost trends and any\nchanges in circumstances that might influence the\ncosts must be taken into consideration.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:801\n\n801\n\nCompetitive Supplier Proposals\n\nWherever it is intended to subcontract an activity,\nbinding subcontractor proposals probably provide\nthe most reliable estimate. However, each customer\nshould preserve the capability to estimate and assess\nthe cost of activities to be subcontracted. This is es-\npecially true whenever there is only little or no real\ncompetition, or when subsequent customer-generated\nmodifications are likely.\n\nParametric Analysis\n\nParametric analysis requires careful consideration\nof costs as well as technical and programmatic in-\nformation. This makes it possible to identify cost\ndrivers and to develop cost models. This approach\neffectively correlates labor costs and personnel with\nparameters describing the product to be costed. This\ncorrelation leads to regression formulas known as\ncost estimation relationships (CERs). CER can range\nfrom simple mathematical relationships to highly\ncomplex equations and can be drawn up wherever\nthere is an adequate amount of data available. CERs\nare typically developed for a particular technology\ntaking into account associated representative parame-\nters (such as mass, power or surface) and the model\nphilosophy. The following equation is an example of\na simple CER:\n\nCosts =a-P\u2019-n\n\nwhere parameters a and b are determined by sta-\ntistical analyses of cost reference data. In this case\nthe technical parameter is P, for example the unit\nmass, and n could be the number of models to be\ndeveloped.\n\nParametric cost models can be either developed\nwithin an organization to analyze its own data or\npurchased on the commercial market. In the latter\ncase it is essential to calibrate the models with speci-\nfic reference data from the user\u2019s organization. Even\nthough there may be significant costs associated with\ndeveloping such models or purchasing licenses for\ncommercial versions, they have a number of advan-\ntages. They allow estimates or assessments to be made\nfairly rapidly and at relatively low cost, the evolution\nof the processes involved can be traced, and they can\nbe rerun at a later point in time.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:18 PM\n",

Such models might then com-\nbine general design parameters such as aperture sizes,\nwavelengths or the type of telescope with more specific\nparameters such as mass or development effort.\n\nFor every method and model the following should\nbe considered:\n\ne Application limitations of the models\n\ne Sensitivity of certain parameters\n\ne Contract and economic conditions\n\ne Impact of the industrial consortium\n\ne Need for a plausibility check of the results\n\ne Best opportunity for applying the model results.\n\nOutput\n\nLast but not least, cost estimates serve the customer as\n\nwell as the client as a common basis for understanding.\n\nA cost estimate as a quantitative evaluation of the most\n\nlikely project cost can be presented either in summarized\n\nor detailed form. As described in Table 9.3.1, a cost esti-\n\nmate contains a variety of cost categories such as labor,\n\nmaterial, subsystems, services, facilities and information\n\ntechnology, as well as specific categories such as alloca-\n\ntions for inflation or reserves. The extent and type of\n\nadditional, supporting information depend on require-\n\nments and the field of application. Independent of the\n\nlevel of detail, the supporting documentation should\n\nprovide a clear, professional and complete picture of\n\nhow the cost estimate was derived. The supporting\n\ndocumentation should include the following:\n\ne Project content description\n\ne Description of the assumptions\n\ne Description of the estimation\n\ne Acost risk/cost opportunity analysis\n\ne  Trade-off analyses\n\ne Description of constraints and boundary con-\nditions\n\ne Definition of the cost estimation process; that\nis, the method used to implement the cost esti-\nmation process in the organization vis-a-vis the\nsubcontractors.\n\n9.3.4.2 Cost Budgeting\n\nCost budgeting is the process of planning cost for a\nproject by aggregating cost estimates for single work\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\npackages (WPs) into a binding cost baseline, thus\ndefining the cost flows planned for the duration of\nthe project.\n\nInput\n\nThe following information and input are required for\n\nthe cost budgeting process:\n\ne Work breakdown structure (WBS)\n\ne Work package description (WPD)\n\ne Cost estimates (e.g., for WPs, subsystems, tasks,\nassemblies, material, etc.)\n\ne Basis of estimate (BoE) (i.e., documentation of the\nassumptions behind the cost estimates)\n\ne Project schedule\n\ne Availability of resources (e.g., resource calendar,\ncost limits, financial planning)\n\ne Contract information (e.g., prices for external\nproducts and services).\n\nMethods\n\nCost budgeting can be broken down into three major\n\nsteps, described as follows:\n\n1. Aggregation of the Cost Estimates: Allocation of\nall estimated cost items to WPs according to the\nproject\u2019s WBS. Aggregation of these costs to higher\nnodes of the WBS, resulting in the total project\ncost at the top WBS node. In addition, by taking\ninto consideration the schedule information for all\nWPs, the project\u2019s cost profile (planned spending\nover time) can be derived.\n\n2. Establishing a Management Reserve: The inherent\ncost risk of a project \u2014 analyzed as part of the cost\nestimation process \u2014 is reflected in a management\nreserve incorporated in the project budget. This\nreserve can be tapped to fund potential mitigation\nactions which may become necessary in the course\nof a project to avoid risks or to reduce the impact of\nemerging risks. It should be noted that the reserve\nis not part of the cost baseline, meaning that it is\nnot allocated to specific WPs, and that it can only\nbe used with the authorization of the project ma-\nnager or customer. In recent cost risk analyses the\noverall cost risk of a project is broken down into\nthe hierarchy levels in a project organization which\nrepresent the risk source. In this case the project\u2019s\nmanagement reserve covers only the cost risk\ncontributions directly associated with carrying out\n\n2/25/09 3:37:18 PM\n",
    "824": "9.3 Cost Management\n\na project (e.g., technical development, planning,\nscheduling). Other cost risk contributions, such as\nmore indirect events stemming from the project\nenvironment (e.g., political and market risk) and\nforce majeure, are typically borne at the corporate\nlevel (i.e., by the company or space agency) and\nare thus not budgeted to the project.\n\n3. Smoothing the Cost Profile: The original cost pro-\nfile derived from steps 1 and 2 needs to be adjusted\nto when financial resources become available. The\nobjective is to facilitate funding by achieving a\nsmooth cost profile which avoids extreme fluctua-\ntions and remains within the customer\u2019s affordabi-\nlity limits. In the case of development projects, the\nbest practice regards an S-shaped cumulative cost\ncurve as being the most favorable profile for total\nlife cost, balancing the project\u2019s duration and cost.\nBesides utilizing financing instruments to decouple\nspending from cost flows, a shifting of WP tasks\nor schedules might also be required to smooth the\ncost profile. It should be noted that such activities\ngenerally have a detrimental impact on project\ncosting and scheduling. Moreover, the practice\ncould even introduce new conflicts with regard\nto resource availability and milestones. As such,\ncost budgeting for a project is an iterative process\neventually leading to the project\u2019s cost baseline.\n\nOutput\n\nThe main outputs of cost budgeting are:\n\ne Cost Baseline: Planned cost for scheduled work\nover the project\u2019s timeline. It is used as a reference\nfor cost and schedule performance measurement.\n\ne Funding Plan: Date and amount of funding steps\nto finance the project costs, aligned with the cost\nbaseline.\n\ne Change Requests (CRs): The cost budgeting pro-\ncess could result in change requests compared\nto the project schedule. After being assessed and\naccepted, such changes have to be documented\nin adjusted management plans (this is the task of\nchange management).\n\n9.3.4.3 Cost Control\n\nCost control in general can be characterized as the pro-\ncess of influencing cost driving factors in such a way\nthat cost increases are contained and opportunities\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:803\n\n803\n\nfor savings are exploited. In addition, cost control\ncomprises the task of tracking and documenting all\nchanges in the cost baseline.\n\nThe nature of the cost control process also varies\nwith the contract price type, with the distinction\nusually being between a fixed price contract and a\ncost reimbursement contract. Their main differences\ncan be described as follows.\n\nIn the case of a fixed price contract \u2014 which is the\nstandard contract type for space projects in Europe \u2014\nthe product is exactly defined in scope, deliverables\nand WP effort. This allows a price to be fixed for the\nend product which includes all margins for profit,\nescalation/inflation and project risks. If a fixed price\nneeds to be adjusted in the course of the project, the\ncontract has to be changed. This can be requested by\neither party through a change request (CR), which\nmust be negotiated and formally agreed by all parties.\nTo become effective the changes have to be documen-\nted ina so-called contract change notice (CCN) which\namends the original contract.\n\nIn a cost reimbursement contract the contrac-\n\ntor is compensated for the expenses incurred while\ncompleting agreed-upon work. The contractor also\nreceives a negotiated profit according to the contract\nspecifics (fixed profit fee or profit percentage). Project\nrisks and inflation are typically borne and paid by the\ncustomer. Consequently, for this contract type the cost\nper product can grow considerably since the effort to\nachieve a result is reimbursed, in contrast to payment\nfor a completed product in fixed price contracts. On\nthe other hand, this contract type allows adjustments\nin the project plan to be easily handled by redirecting\neffort among WPs. If required, the customer is able to\nexercise direct control over the work program through\nthis mechanism. This flexibility in project execution\nrenders cost reimbursement contracts very suitable for\nmajor development or state-of-the-art projects, where\ntypically neither the product nor the work plan can be\ndefined up-front in detail and changes are likely.\nn view of cost control, cost reimbursement con-\ntracts may seem to be disadvantageous, as they bear a\nhigher potential of unwarranted payments which may\nlead to cost overruns. Additionally, all adjustments to\nthe original baseline have to be assessed with respect\nto their impact on schedules and cost at completion so\nthat budgets are not exceeded or delays introduced.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:19 PM\n",
    "825": "CHO9.indd Sec1:804\n\n804\n\nAccordingly, several precautions are necessary on\nthe customers\u2019 side governing the cost control process\nin cost reimbursement contracts. First, cost targets\nper WP are set and scheduled on the project time-\nline. Even though these targets are not contractually\nbinding, they are utilized as a cost and performance\nmeasurement baseline. Second, the customer needs to\nset up an appropriate progress tracking system to trace\naccomplished work. In combination with the perfor-\nmance measurement baseline this allows assessment\nof the justification for costs claimed by contractors. In\nparticular, such a system lays the foundation for the\nearned value management to derive cost and schedule\nperformance indices and to facilitate trend analysis\nregarding cost at completion, further explained un-\nder \u201cMethods\u201d in the section below. Moreover, cost\ndiscipline should be enforced by bonus agreements\nfor exceeding project performance (e.g., early delivery)\nand by penalties for underperformance.\n\nCost reimbursement contracts are the standard\ncontract type in the USA for aerospace and govern-\nment projects.\n\nInput\n\nFor both contract types the following input is re-\nquired:\n\n\u00a9 Cost baseline\n\ne Funding plan\n\ne Project progress reports, documenting work pro-\ngress and deviations with respect to the project\nbaseline (cost and schedule)\n\ne Project management plan (PMP), which in this\ncase specifies the scope and responsibilities asso-\nciated with the project control process.\n\nAdditional input for projects on fixed price con-\ntracts:\n\ne Payment plan (payment milestones)\n\ne Contract change notices (CCNs).\n\nAdditional input for projects on cost reimbursement\n\ncontracts:\n\ne Authorized changes to the cost baseline, contract,\n\nscope of work, project schedule.\n\ne Performance reports at the cut-off date of a speci-\nfied reporting period. In particular the following\nreports are required:\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\n\u2014 Percentage of work complete (physical pro-\ngress) for ongoing WPs and activities\n\n\u2014 Actual cost (authorized cost incurred) at\ncut-off date.\n\nMethods\n\nThe key to cost control in all contract types is the\ndefinition of the percentage of work complete. It de-\ntermines the actual work finished in a WP versus the\noverall planned work for that WP. Even though this\ndefinition is sound and clear there are some practical\nproblems involved in measuring appropriately the\nfinished work portion. For example, many projects\ndetermine the percentage of work completed via the\nratio of work hours spent over hours scheduled. This\nappears reliable at first sight but, as is commonly\nknown, effort is not strictly correlated with progress,\nwhich may lead to skewed reporting. Even worse is the\ncommon practice of taking the task manager\u2019s subjec-\ntive judgment on the achievement as input for work\ncomplete. This bears a high risk of biasing the report,\nsince even the most experienced manager is optimistic\nabout assessing the work status. Moreover, the perspec-\ntives on achievement may diverge dramatically between\ncustomer and contractor. Lessons learned confirm that\nsuch methods do not qualify for rigorous cost control\nas they are systematically inaccurate because of devi-\nations between status report and reality.\n\nTo overcome this problem, a reliable and objective\nmethod for determining work progress must be found.\nThe solution is to introduce physical progress mea-\nsurement for each WP that is to be monitored for cost\ncontrol purposes. With physical progress measure-\nment the percentage of work complete is predefined\nand linked to physically measurable achievements\n(i.e., contractually agreed deliverables or events).\nWith this method a rigorous progress tracking system\ncan be established throughout the project. For space\nprojects the delivery of development models turned\nout to establish a good physical measurement leading\ntoa typical scale of completion percentages as follows:\n10% for structural model delivery, 85% for prototype\ndelivery and 100% at acceptance review sign-off.\n\nCost Control in Fixed Price Contracts\nIn contrast to popular opinion, a fixed price contract\ndoes not protect from price increases. Therefore,\n\n2/25/09 3:37:19 PM\n",
    "826": "9.3 Cost Management\n\nrigorous cost control based on progress measurement\nis also required for fixed price contracts. When scru-\ntinized, the term fixed price actually means a certain\nprice for a fully specified product (work program and\ndeliverables). In other words, changing the product\nspecification \u2014 even if required for a good reason\n\u2014 formally leads to renegotiation and potentially to\nprice increases.\n\nConsidering space projects, in mostly new de-\nvelopments or state-of-the-art projects trying to\nadvance technological limits, the specific definition\nof a product has to be vague by nature. This prepares\nthe ground for repeated product adjustments, chan-\nge requests and CCNs with their cost increases. It is\nobvious that such an environment requires good and\nsystematic cost control.\n\nGenerally in fixed price contracts, payments are\ninked to project milestones, forming thereby so-called\npayment milestones. Typically, project reviews (SRR,\nPDR, CDR, etc.) or handovers of deliverables are best\nsuited to serve as payment milestones because they\nrepresent the finalization of a dedicated project phase.\nThe project costs are determined for these project\nphases using the cost baseline, and the respective\namount of the scheduled cost is allocated to the pay-\nment milestone representing that phase. This amount\nmay need to be supplemented with procurement costs\nor long-lead items requiring advance purchase.\n\nIn this setup the main task of cost control is to\nsubstantiate that physical progress at the payment\nmilestone is in line with the schedule, thus justifying\nthe payment of the predefined amount according\nto the cost baseline. If any deviations occur, the cost\ncontroller has the task of identifying corrective actions\nand reporting them to project management for further\nimplementation. Other tasks include the assessment\nof contract change requests (CCRs), preparing the\nrespective negotiations, documenting cost changes\ndue to CCNs, and continuously updating the esti-\nmated cost at project completion, keeping the project\nmanager informed of the overall project cost whenever\na change is made.\n\nCost Control in Cost Reimbursement Contracts\n\nIn this contract type the contractor is entitled to\ntimely compensation for costs incurred. In cases\nof low work efficiency this holds the danger of an\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:805\n\n805\n\nimbalance between work performance and incurred\ncost. In the long run this leads to overpayments, which\nadd up to higher cost at completion. Because the cost\nat completion reacts quite sensitively to fluctuations\nin contractor efficiency, the most important task for\nthe cost controller is to detect as early as possible any\ndeviations from the cost baseline, then to identify the\ncause, quantify possible effects \u2014 especially on cost at\ncompletion \u2014 and assess whether corrective action\nneeds to be taken.\n\nIn earned value analysis (EVA) a well-proven\nperformance measurement method exists to assist\nthe cost control process in its task of identifying\ndeviations. The purpose of EVA is to determine at a\npredefined cut-off date (e.g., the end of the month)\nthe value of work performed. This makes it possible\nto compare in an integrated way scheduled work, ac-\ncomplished work and actual effort. In order to carry\nout such an integrated assessment all these parameters\nneed common metrics. They are therefore expressed\nin cost units.\n\nThe EVA method of performance measurement\ncan be scaled to any project level, namely single ac-\ntivities, WPs or the entire project. In large projects it\nis best practice to limit the effort for the controlling\nprocess by selecting a typical subset of work packages\non which EVA is carried out. These are designated as\ncontrol accounts (CAs). They are also used to delegate\nresponsibility in the controlling process to different\ncontractor levels by designating control account ma-\nnagers (CAMs). The three control values required for\nEVA are determined for every CA at every cut-off date.\nThey are described as follows:\n\ne Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS):\nPlanned cost for work (activity, WP, project) at\ncut-off date according to the cost baseline.\n\ne Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or\nearned value: Budgeted cost for the work (activity,\nWP, project) actually accomplished at the cut-\noff date. This value generally is calculated as the\npercentage of work complete multiplied by the\nbudgeted total cost for a work unit:\n\nBCWP = % work complete x budgeted total cost\n\ne Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP): Actual\ncost incurred for the work (activity, WP, project)\naccomplished at cut-off date.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:20 PM\n",
    "827": "CHO9.indd Sec1:806\n\n806\n\nWith these values, project efficiency, schedule perfor-\n\nmance and cost performance are easily determined by\n\ncalculating the following indices:\n\ne Schedule performance index (SPI) = BCWP/\nBCWS > 1 is good (ahead of schedule)\n\n\u00a9 Cost performance index (CPI) = BCWP/ACWP\n= 1 is good (cost right on plan)\n\nThe performance indices influence the originally\nplanned project cost, denominated budget at com-\npletion (BAC). An estimate of the total project cost\n\u2014 the estimate at completion (EAC) \u2014 related to SPI\nand CPI is given by the following equation:\n\nEstimate at completion (EAC) = ACWP + (BAC \u2014\nBCWP)/(CPI x SPI)\n\nThe variance at completion (VAC), which defines the\ndelta cost at completion of the project, is determined\nby the difference between the original budget and\nthe EAC:\n\nVariance at completion (VAC) = BAC \u2014 EAC\n(a positive value is favorable)\n\nThese forecasts, performed at every cut-off date (typi-\ncally on a monthly basis), provide a clear picture of the\nperformance trend in a project. A comparison of BAC\nand EAC provides transparency about the most likely\ncost overrun if no corrective actions are taken.\n\nCost cumulative\n\nFigure 9.3.5: Earned value analysis.\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nAnother very important parameter for project ma-\nnagement is the cost required to complete the project\nor the estimate to complete (ETC). This information\ncan be computed via the following relationship:\n\ne Estimate to complete (ETC) = EAC - ACWP\n\nIf the project manager aims at completing the project\nwithin the original cost budget BAC, then the effi-\nciency required to do so is calculated as the ratio of\nremaining work divided by remaining budget:\n\ne To-complete performance index (TCPI) = (BAC\n\u2014 BCWP)/(BAC \u2014 ACWP)\n\nFor example, if 25% of the work has been performed\nwith 50% of the budget (CPI = 0.5), then the subse-\nquent TCPI has to increase to 1.5.\n\nThe difference between the TCPI and the demons-\ntrated CPI is a good indicator for judging whether the\nplanning is realistic. In the example given it is very\nunlikely that the efficiency can be improved from 50%\nto 150%, rendering the planning unrealistic.\n\nA common way to communicate the findings of\nan EVA is to display the cost baseline (BCWS), the\nactual cost (ACWP) and the earned value (BCWP)\nas cumulative cost curves. This way the performance\nhistory, the schedule and cost variances, BAC and EAC\ncan all be clearly displayed (see Figure 9.3.5).\n\nCost\nvariance\n\nSchedule\ni variance [time\n\nTime\n\nCut-off date Planned Projected\ncompletion completion\ndate date\n\n2/25/09 3:37:20 PM\n",

They require answers\nto the following questions:\n\ne What results/deliverables were planned?\n\ne What effort was planned/budgeted for achieving\nthe results?\n\ne To what degree were the planned results realized?\n\ne Which effort was required to achieve the results?\n\ne Which effort should have been claimed for the\n\nresults (\u2014 earned value)?\n\nOutput\n\nThe following information is typically the expected\n\noutput of a cost control process:\n\n\u00a9 Modification of original cost estimates and mo-\ndification of the documentation about the basis\nof the estimate (BOE)\n\ne Modification of the cost baseline according to\nauthorized changes\n\ne Performance indices for control accounts and\nspecifically selected elements of the WBS\n\ne Status reports on the project progress (physical\nprogress measurement of control accounts)\n\ne Estimate of total project cost at completion\n(EAC)\n\ne Projection of the most likely completion date ba-\nsed on demonstrated schedule performance\n\ne Recommendation of corrective action to improve\nproject efficiency (e.g., budget adjustments, real-\nlocation of resources, reorganization of project\nschedule/network)\n\ne Modification of the project management plan\n(reorganization)\n\ne Documentation of \u201clessons learned\u201d (analysis of\nroot causes for cost deviations and their docu-\nmentation).\n\n9.3.5 Close-out\n\nThe end of a cost management process is characteri-\nzed by the so-called project close-out, documenting\nlessons learned and formulating best practices for co-\nming projects. This last phase of the cost management\nprocess is often neglected, mostly for organizational\nreasons. The project team is dissolving, new tasks lie\nahead and obligations to exchange information may\nhave ceased with the end of the contract.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:807\n\n807\n\nIt should, however, be noted that a proper project\nclose-out is of utmost importance for cost manage-\nment, since all processes, methods and models need\nverification, calibration and feedback. Only if expe-\nriences are recorded, documented and exploited are\nfuture improvements likely.\n\nTherefore, the task of cost management after\ncompleting a project lies in a comparison of the ac-\ntual cost at completion (CAC) to former budgets and\nestimates, followed by a discrepancy analysis in case\nmajor differences are found. Actual cost and findings\nresulting from this analysis are generally required to\ncalibrate cost estimating models in order to improve\ntheir accuracy.\n\nIn addition, the discrepancy analysis is also used to\nidentify causes for cost increases in a systematic manner.\nCauses for cost increases are typically stochastic (e.g.,\ntest failure, accident, loss of contractor) or systematic\n(e.g., late change in requirements, adverse market effects\nand procurement policies, or underestimated comple-\nxities). In the latter case they should be documented\nas lessons learned and communicated to the project\norganizers so they can be avoided in the future.\n\n9.3.6 Outlook\n\n9.3.6.1 Virtual Competition\n\nThe general trend to mergers in the aerospace industry\nleads to conglomeration and less competition in this\nindustrial sector. There are already some areas, espe-\ncially in the space business, where only one supplier\nexists, posing a risk of monopoly and high prices\ndetrimental to space projects.\n\nUtilizing the cost estimating capacity of good cost\nmanagement could help to overcome such detrimen-\ntal monopoly situations. The idea is to confront a\nmonopoly supplier with a robust cost estimate for its\nproduct which urges the supplier to defend its price.\nThis is believed to instigate the effect of price compe-\ntition, possibly leading to lower prices. This approach\nis tagged \u201cvirtual competition.\u201d\n\n9.3.6.2 Electronic B2B\n\nBecause of the increasing relevance of electronic\nprocurement between business partners \u2014 called\n\n2/25/09 3:37:21 PM\n",

The reason\nis the ability to respond quickly with a quotation to\nan announcement of opportunity/RFQ.\n\nIf parametric cost models are harmonized and\naudited between the customer and the supplier, they\nmake feasible both real-time cost proposals by the\nsuppliers and real-time proposal evaluation by the\ncustomer. In other words, the time and cost involved\nin presenting and evaluating a proposal could be dra-\nmatically decreased. In addition, useless discussions\nabout different perspectives on determining work\neffort could be avoided because the whole proposal is\nbased on objective, physical design parameters (mass,\nthrust, data rate, area, etc.).\n\nSuch a system would be an extremely valuable\nasset for space agencies willing to introduce elect-\nronic procurement portals, copying the trend in the\nautomotive industry.\n\nBibliography\n\n9.3.1 ECSS-M-60B.

They arise not just when there is an incident\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nor disagreement among the parties. Legal aspects\ncan also govern the mission concept and should the-\nrefore be considered at a very early stage of mission\nplanning.\n\nIn contrast to many other legal fields, the source\nof space law is in public international law. Public in-\nternational law is in particular the law governing the\nrelations among states as well as the law governing\ninternational organizations. Consequently, public\ninternational law does not address the individual,\nin principle. Nevertheless, knowledge of it is indis-\npensable for understanding the rights and obligations\nof the individual, for example why space activities\nrequire authorization, or what contents a contract\nbetween the parties to a space mission should have.\nPublic international law on space activities will the-\nrefore be introduced first (Section 9.4.1).\n\nThis will be followed by an overview of the laws\ndirectly relevant for the individual (Section 9.4.2).\nFinally, recent developments in space politics and space\npolicies in the European Space Agency (ESA) as well as\nin the European Union (EU) will be presented.\n\n9.4.1 Basic Rules of Space Law\n\nSpace law is based on public international law. Ninety-\neight states have agreed that outer space is not subject\nto national appropriation. It is therefore regarded as\ninternational territory, similar to the high seas and\nAntarctica; no state is allowed to claim sovereignty;\nno national legislation applies in outer space unless\nagreed by public international law.\n\nA prominent role within public international law\non outer space is taken by the international treaties\ndrafted under the auspices of the United Nations.\nThese treaties were then submitted to states for sign-\ning. There are also other agreements between states\nwhich apply to outer space activities.\n\n9.4.1.1 International Outer Space Law of the\nUnited Nations\n\nThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\nof the United Nations has drafted five treaties on outer\nspace since 1962 [9.4.1]. They have been signed and\nratified by states as follows:\n\n2/25/09 3:37:22 PM\n",
    "830": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\ne Outer Space Treaty (98 ratifications and 27\nsignatories)\n\ne Rescue Agreement (88 ratifications and 25 signa-\ntories)\n\ne Liability Convention (82 ratifications and 25\nsignatories)\n\ne Registration Convention (45 ratifications and 4\nsignatories)\n\ne Moon Treaty (11 ratifications and 5 signatories).\n\nMoreover, the General Assembly of the United Nations\nhas also adopted seven resolutions on outer space.\n\nFreedom to Use and Explore Outer Space and its\nLimits\n\nMost relevant is the treaty on the principles governing\nthe activities of states in the exploration and use of\nouter space, including the Moon and other celestial\nbodies, as opened for signature on January 27, 1967\n(Outer Space Treaty).\n\nArt. I (2) of the Outer Space Treaty guarantees the\nfreedom of exploration and use of outer space, which\nis to be free and without discrimination on a basis of\nequality and in accordance with international law. Art.\nII of the Outer Space Treaty defines the limitations:\nouter space is not subject to national appropriation by\nclaim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation,\nor by any other means.\n\nBridging this tension, the Outer Space Treaty es-\ntablishes obligations for states undertaking activities\nin outer space: The exploration and use of outer space\nis to be undertaken:\n\ne for the benefit of and in the interest of all coun-\ntries\n\ne in accordance with international law, including\nthe Charter of the United Nations\n\ne without placing in orbit any objects carrying nu-\nclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction\n\ne for peaceful purposes\n\ne with due regard to the corresponding interests of\nother states\n\ne while avoiding harmful contamination of outer\nspace and adverse changes to Earth\u2019s environ-\nment\n\ne while opening all stations, installations and equip-\nment on the Moon and other celestial bodies to re-\npresentatives of other states on a reciprocal basis.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:809\n\n809\n\nIn addition, the Outer Space Treaty establishes an\nobligation to assist astronauts in the event of accidents\nand incidents as well as an obligation to return to the\nstate of registry any objects which return to Earth from\nspace [9.4.2], [9.4.3].\n\nState Responsibility for Activities in Outer Space\nAccording to Art. VI of the Outer Space Treaty, states\nare responsible for national activities in outer space.\nThis responsibility exists regardless of whether the\nactivity is undertaken by a governmental agency or by\na non-governmental entity. This responsibility aims\nat assuring that all national activities are carried out\nin conformity with the Outer Space Treaty, especially\nwith the above-mentioned obligations. For govern-\nmental activities this can be assured through internal\nguidelines which are also applicable to activities of\nthe respective national space agencies. Additional\nregulations are required for activities undertaken by\nnon-governmental entities. Therefore, the states have\nthe obligation, according to Art. VI (2) of the Outer\nSpace Treaty, to authorize and continuously supervise\nsuch nongovernmental activities in outer space. Based\non this, a dozen states have enacted national space\nlegislation which specifies authorization requirements\nand procedures as required by Art. VI (2) of the Outer\nSpace Treaty; see Section 9.4.2.1 below.\n\nRegistration of Space Objects\n\nThe Convention on Registration of Objects Laun-\nched into Outer Space was opened for signature on\nJanuary 14, 1975 (Registration Convention) and\nestablishes a two-tiered registration system [9.4.4],\n[9.4.5], [9.4.6].\n\nArt. II of the Registration Convention obliges the\nstate to maintain a national registry of objects laun-\nched into outer space. In this registry, the state must\nenter information about the space objects for which\nthis state is the launching state. A launching state is a\nstate which has launched or procured the launching of\nthe space object or from whose territory or facility a\nspace object was launched, see Art. I (a) Registration\nConvention. Where there are two or more launching\nstates for any such object, they jointly determine\nwhich of them has to register the object, Art. II (2)\nRegistration Convention. There is only one state of\nregistry for a space object. Only this state is subject\n\n2/25/09 3:37:22 PM\n",
    "831": "CHO9.indd Sec1:810\n\n810\n\nto the rules, which will be described below (the obli-\ngation to inform the Secretary General of the United\nNations, the right to exercise jurisdiction and control).\nIn case the space object is operated by a private legal\nentity, a university or a research organization, the\nstate must be informed of the forthcoming launch so\nthat it can enter into relevant agreements with other\nlaunching states.\n\nArt. IV of the Registration Convention obliges the\nstate of registry to furnish to the Secretary General of\nthe United Nations as soon as practicable the following\ninformation: name of the launching state or states,\nan appropriate designation for the space object or its\nregistration number, date and territory or location\nof the launch, basic orbital parameters (including\nnodal period, inclination, apogee and perigee) and the\ngeneral function of the space object [9.4.7], [9.4.8].\nThe Secretary General of the United Nations, assisted\nby the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs,\nenters this information in the international register\non space objects [9.4.9].\n\nWhile the contents of the international register are\ndefined by Art. IV of the Registration Convention, the\ncontents of the national registries (and the conditions\nunder which they are maintained) may be determined\nby the state of registry. It is obvious that the national\nregistry can serve as an entry point to gather the in-\nformation which must be furnished to the Secretary\nGeneral of the United Nations. Additional informa-\ntion (such as the name of the operator, mass\u2014density\nratio) may, however, be required.\n\nFinally, Art. VIII (1) of the Outer Space Treaty\nallocates jurisdiction and control over a space object\nto the state on whose national registry the object is\ncarried \u2014 even though the object is then located in the\ninternational territory of \u201couter space.\u201d This guaran-\ntees that national legislation remains applicable to the\nspace object [9.4.10].\n\nState Liability for Damage Caused by Space\nObjects\n\nStates bear international liability for damages to an-\nother state party or to its natural or juridical persons\ncaused by space objects, Art. VII Outer Space Treaty\n[9.4.11], [9.4.12]. This article provides \u2014 in case of\ndamage \u2014 at least one liable state to the injured third\nparty [9.4.13]. State liability is not based on the\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\ncausation of damage. It is rather based on the parti-\ncipation of a state at the moment of launch; that is,\nthat state has contributed to placing the object into\nouter space (launching state). It is sufficient that a\nstate has authorized (or was obliged to authorize) the\nactivity for which the space object is used [9.4.14].\nFor the state this entails liability even if the damage\nwas caused by private activity. Therefore, the state\nmust ensure that it receives information about all\nactivities carried out from its territory or by its\nnatural or juridical persons. At best the state will\nscrutinize the activity with regard to safety aspects\nand authorize as well as supervise it. At the same time\nthe state has to establish a legal basis for indemni-\nfication against the private actor which caused the\ndamage, because international liability according to\nArt. VII of the Outer Space Treaty is only a liability\nin addition to the direct liability of the person who\ncaused the damage.\n\nThe linkage of international liability to participati-\nonat the moment of launch of the space object implies\nthat there is always a state liable toward the person\ndamaged. The state from whose territory a satellite\nwas launched is still liable for damage caused by that\nsatellite several years later. The state which operated\na satellite for several years is still liable if it hands over\nthe satellite to an operator under foreign jurisdiction,\nafter which the satellite causes damage. This seems to\nbe unfair at first glance. But states can agree among\nthemselves on an internal indemnification [9.4.15],\n[9.4.16]. If, in the latter case, the satellite was not\noperated by the state, but by a private entity, the state\nneeds to receive information about the intention of\nthat operator to sell the satellite to another operator\nabroad so that it can then enter into such an agree-\nment with the state which exercises jurisdiction over\nthe new operator.\n\nThis international liability established by Art. VII\nof the Outer Space Treaty is extended and specified by\nthe Convention on International Liability for Damages\nCaused by Space Objects, as opened for signature on\nMarch 29, 1972 (Liability Convention).\n\nAbsolute liability as stated in Art. VII of the Outer\nSpace Treaty is partly attenuated by Art. II of the\nLiability Convention. Only damages which are caused\non the Earth\u2019s surface or to aircraft in flight (i.e.,\ndamages which might occur during launch or reentry)\n\n2/25/09 3:37:23 PM\n",
    "832": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\nare subject to absolute liability. For damages caused to\nother space objects or to persons or property thereon\n(i.e., damages in outer space) the launching state is\nonly liable if it caused this damage, see Art. III Liability\nConvention.\n\nArt. XI (2) of the Liability Convention clarifies\nthat international liability of the launching state(s)\naccording to Arts. I-IV of the Liability Convention\npertains in addition to the \u201cnormal\u201d claim for damages\nof the injured party against the injuring party. The\ninjured party can choose whether it claims against\nthe injuring party or against the launching state. Once\nthe injured party has pursued one of these claims, the\nother claim is excluded.\n\nBecause the aforementioned rules are based on a\ntreaty among states and because they intend to pro-\ntect third parties, Art. VII of the Liability Convention\nexcludes the applicability of this additional possibility\nto claim against the launching state(s) for damages to\nnationals of the launching state as well as for damages\nto persons who are participating in the operation of\nthe space object which caused the damage. These per-\nsons may still pursue a claim for damages according to\nnational laws or according to their contracts.\n\nFor a space object there is typically more than\none launching state. This is based on the linkage of\nthe participating of states with the launch event \u2014 as\nspecified in Art. VII of the Outer Space Treaty and Art.\n\n(c) of the Liability Convention. A state is liable if it\nlaunches the space object, if it procures the launching\nof the space object, or if the space object is launched\nrom its territory or facility. If any of these criteria\napply, the state is a launching state. For a German\nsatellite launched, for example, from French Guiana\n(which is a French overseas department and there-\nore French territory) both France and Germany are\naunching states. The number of launching states in-\ncreases correspondingly in international cooperation\nprojects. The Liability Convention reflects this in Art.\nV: all launching states are jointly and severally liable.\nA state to which or to whose nationals damage was\ncaused can address one of the launching states and\nclaim the full damage from that state. This launching\nstate must then internally claim compensation from\nthe other launching state(s). The Liability Convention\nrecommends that agreements among the launching\nstates be concluded on how they apportion liability\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:811\n\n811\n\namong themselves, Art. V (2). In case the space object\nis part of a private activity in outer space, the state(s)\nwhich might become liable for damage caused by that\nobject need to know about such activity in order to\ndecide whether or not to enter into such agreements\nwith other launching state(s).\n\nA claim for damages according to Art. VII of the\nOuter Space Treaty or Arts. II-IV of the Liability Con-\nvention can only be pursued by a state. If the damage\nwas suffered by a private natural or legal person, they\nhave to ask \u201ctheir\u201d state to place a claim against the\nlaunching state(s). The claim for damage has to be\npresented to a launching state through diplomatic\nchannels within one year after occurrence of the da-\nmage (or identification of the launching state). If no\nsettlement of the claim is reached within one year, the\nparties concerned must establish a Claims Commis-\nsion composed of a member of the claimant state, a\nmember of the launching state (if there is more than\none launching state, they have to agree upon one) and\na member chosen jointly by both parties. The decision\nof the Claims Commission is by majority vote. The\ndecisions are final and binding.\n\nFurther Outer Space Law of the United Nations\n\nSo far, three main treaties on outer space have been\nmentioned: the Outer Space Treaty, the Registration\nConvention and the Liability Convention.\n\nThe Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts,\nthe Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects\nLaunched into Outer Space, as opened for signature\non April 22, 1968 (the Rescue Agreement), has been\nof very little relevance so far. It obliges its member\nstates to notify the launching authority as well as\nthe Secretary General of the United Nations about\nevery accident, condition of distress, emergency or\nunintended landing of a spacecraft in the territory\nunder its jurisdiction. It specifies that the state takes\nall possible steps to render all necessary assistance\nto the astronauts and return them to the launching\nauthority. Space objects returned to Earth have to be\nrecovered and returned to the launching authority,\nas well. If the state on whose territory such an object\nwas found has reason to believe that the object is of\na hazardous or deleterious nature, it must notify the\nlaunching authority. The launching authority then has\nto take effective steps to eliminate possible danger.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:23 PM\n",

A reason for the reluctance of states to\nratify the Moon Treaty might be Art. 11 (1) of that\ntreaty, which declares the Moon and other celestial\nbodies to be the \u201ccommon heritage of mankind.\u201d \u00b0\nThe relevance of this norm, say for the use of mineral\nresources, is very much contested [9.4.17]. The (11)\nratifying states have in any case agreed to establish\nan international regime governing the exploitation\nof mineral resources, see Art. 11 (5) Moon Treaty.\nScientific investigation of the Moon is not restricted,\nsee Art. 6 (1) of the Moon Treaty.\n\nIn addition to these five treaties, the United Na-\ntions has established seven resolutions on outer space.\nResolutions are not international treaties. They do not\nbind the states. But resolutions are acts of volition of\nthe (General Assembly of the) United Nations. They\nhave the nature of guidelines [9.4.18]. The existing\nresolutions are as follows:\n\nSome of these resolutions will be mentioned in the\ncourse of the following text.\n\n9.4.1.2 Other International Outer Space Law\n\nIt is not just the United Nations that has originated\ntreaties on outer space. Many other international\nand intergovernmental organizations have compiled\ntreaties on or relating to outer space.\n\nIn 1961 the United Nations asked the International\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:812\n\nA declaration of legal principles governing the\nactivities of states in the exploration and use of\nouter space, adopted on December 13, 1963, which\nwas substituted three years later by the Outer\nSpace Treaty.\n\nThe principles governing the use by states of\nartificial Earth satellites for international direct\ntelevision broadcasting, adopted on December\n10, 1982, which allows for direct broadcasting\nin foreign states (within the satellite\u2019s footprint)\nwithout the prior consent of that foreign state.\nThe principles relating to remote sensing of the\nEarth from outer space, adopted on December\n3, 1986, which allow remote sensing activities\nwithout the prior consent of the sensed state (while\ngranting the right of access to the primary and\nprocessed remotely sensed data of its territory ona\nnondiscriminatory basis and at reasonable cost).\nThe principles relevant to the use of nuclear power\nsources in outer space, adopted on December 14,\n1992, which partly admit the necessity for using\n\nTelecommunications Union (ITU) to regulate radio\ncommunication with and through satellites. To this\nend, the ITU Convention and the Radio Regulations\nwere amended, satellite services were defined and fre-\nquency bands were assigned [9.4.21], [9.4.22]. As the\nprocedure for transferring frequency and orbit usage\nrights from the ITU to its member states is closely\nconnected to the transfer of these usage rights from a\nmember state to the satellite operator, this procedure\nwill be dealt with under Section 9.4.2.1.\n\nThe World Trade Organization also regulated the\narea of telecommunication services. The General Ag-\nreement on Trade in Services including its annex on the\nliberalization of trade in telecommunication services\nentered into force in 1997. It also includes the opening\nof markets for satellite telecommunication services.\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization and\nthe International Maritime Organization act in the\nfield of satellite navigation.

The International Atomic\nEnergy Agency issues standards for the use of nuclear\npower sources on-board satellites; the International\nOrganization for Standardization and the European\nCooperation on Space Standardization develop stan-\ndards for space projects and space technology. The\nUNIDROIT Convention on International Interests\nin Mobile Equipment and its draft protocol on space\nassets raise issues on the simplification of financing\nfor space projects [9.4.23], [9.4.24].\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization has developed rules on ethics\nin outer space.\n\nIntergovernmental agreements exist on the deve-\nlopment and use of the International Space Station\n[9.4.25], on the operation of satellite communication\nsystems (ITSO and IMSO) and on satellite meteoro-\nlogy (EUMETSAT and ARABSAT).\n\nSpace activities often have military implications.\nSome aspects are directly dealt with in the aforemen-\ntioned treaties (e.g., the peaceful use of the Moon\nand other celestial bodies or the prohibition to place\nin Earth orbit objects carrying nuclear weapons or\nweapons of mass destruction). In addition, military\ntreaties of indirect relevance to space activities have\nto be taken into consideration (e.g., the Anti-Ballistic\nMissile Treaty or the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty or the\nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).

What licenses might be necessa-\nry for which activities and how they might be obtained\nwill be described in the following, using Germany as\na specific example. When and to what extent space\nobjects have to be registered will also be described.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:813\n\n813\n\nFinally, some possible contractual relations as well\nas liability scenarios are examined. This section is\nintended as a checklist including practical guidelines,\nwithout a claim to completeness.\n\n9.4.2.1 Necessary Licenses\n\nFrequency Assignment\n\nAn operator needs frequencies within certain frequen-\ncy bands (e.g., C- or Ku-band) in order to command a\nsatellite as well as to transmit data between the satellite\nand its ground segments. Usable frequencies are a\nlimited resource for technical reasons. Therefore, there\nis a need to coordinate the use of frequencies.\n\nSuch coordination is two tiered. First, the use of\nfrequencies by the ground station has to be coordina-\nted and assigned on a national level. Second, the use of\nfrequencies in outer space has to be coordinated and\nassigned internationally by the ITU for its member\nstates; the member state can then assign the right to\nuse such frequencies to an operator. This internatio-\nnal coordination and assignment is dealt with in the\nfollowing section.\n\nThe use of frequencies by ground stations requires\nprior allocation by the Federal Network Agency. The\nprocedure of allocation is laid down in $55 of the\nTelecommunications Act.\n\nSimple reception of telecommunication satellite\nsignals as well as the use of very small satellite sen-\nders and receivers are typically approved by a general\nlicense. They can be set up and used without prior\nallocation of frequencies. But a specific license is\nnecessary to use frequencies in order to command a\nsatellite as well as to transmit data from a satellite to\na ground station.\n\nThe person intending to use such frequencies has\nto apply at the Federal Network Agency. The applica-\ntion should specify the service and type of network,\nthe technology and the area in which the frequency\nwill be used. The applicant has to demonstrate the\nability to use the frequencies effectively and without\ninterfering with other allocated frequencies. Appli-\ncation forms can be downloaded from the website of\nthe Federal Network Agency [9.4.28].\n\nThe allocation of satellite frequencies for ground\nsegments is approved if the frequencies are identified\n\n2/25/09 3:37:24 PM\n",
    "835": "CHO9.indd Sec1:814\n\n814\n\nin the frequency usage plan [9.4.29] and available. The\nuse of such frequencies needs to be efficient, without\ntechnical disturbance, and compatible with other\nfrequency uses.\n\nThe applicant has to pay a fee. According to the\nFrequency Fee Ordinance, the Federal Network Agen-\ncy (currently) charges between \u20ac68 and \u20ac1000. Be-\nsides these fees, the applicant has to pay an annual fee\nof (currently) roughly \u20ac25 per radio station according\nto the Ordinance on Contributions to Protect Inter-\nference-free Frequency Use.\n\nThe licensee must indicate the starting and ter-\nmination dates of the frequency use to the Federal\nNetwork Agency. The licensee also must report sub-\nsequent changes in personal circumstances, such as\nchanges of name, address or shareholder structure.\n\nAs ground segments are often operated by a party\nother than the operator of the satellite, the person to\nwhom frequencies are allocated for the ground segment\ndoes not need to be the same person to whom frequen-\ncies are allocated for use in outer space. Cooperation\nbetween the ground and space segments is regulated by\na treaty among the parties, see Section 9.4.2.3.\n\nTransfer of Orbit and Frequency Usage Rights\nWhile the allocation of frequencies according to \u00a755\nof the Telecommunications Act regulates the use of\nfrequencies by the ground segment, the use of fre-\nquencies in outer space (e.g., to command a satellite)\nrequires additional approval. The operator of the\nsatellite has to apply at the Federal Network Agency\nfor a transfer of orbit and frequency usage rights.\nThese usage rights are allocated by the International\nTelecommunications Union (ITU) to the member\nstates (in this case, Germany). This approval is neces-\nsary in addition to the allocation of frequencies for\nthe ground station, because the use of frequencies by\nsatellites needs international coordination, which is\nhandled according to the public international rules\nof the ITU [9.4.30].\n\nThe procedure for the transfer of orbit and fre-\nquency usage rights is regulated in \u00a756 of the Telecom-\nmunications Act and Administrative Order 8/2005 of\nthe Federal Network Agency [9.4.31].\n\nAt a very early stage the German operator of a\nsatellite system notifies the Federal Network Agency\nof its intention to use satellite frequencies. If the\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\ninternational registration of the satellite system is not\nvia the Federal Network Agency, the operator must\nprovide evidence to the Federal Network Agency of the\ninitiation of the international procedure by another\nITU member state.\n\nIf international registration is via the Federal\nNetwork Agency, the operator must declare one year\nbefore launch its intention to commission the satellite\nsystem and describe the technology to be employed\nand the operating concepts for the satellite.\n\nThe Federal Agency then applies for the needed\nobit and frequency at the ITU with the goal of having\nthe orbit and frequency usage rights transferred to the\nFederal Republic of Germany. The Federal Network\nAgency can permit the private operator to exercise\nthese rights only after these orbit and frequency usage\nrights have been transferred to Germany; that is, after\ncompletion of the ITU procedure.\n\nAccording to the procedures of Administrative\nOrder 8/2005, the private operator has to apply at the\nFederal Network Agency so that the Federal Network\nAgency can apply for these rights at the ITU. The\napplication of the operator has to contain information\nabout the applicant, explanations of how international\ncoordination is to be assured, acceptance of the obliga-\ntion to comply with ITU regulations, confirmation of\na fiduciary account or a bank guarantee in the amount\nof the expected ITU fees, and a concept for the use of\nthe frequencies. The basic technical parameters of the\nsatellite systems have to be supplied as well, especially\nthe frequency band and orbital position to be used, as\nwell as the intended footprint.\n\nThe application is published as advanced publi-\ncation information by the ITU. This is intended to\nprovide information about the planned use of the\norbit and frequency to all other ITU member states.\nBased on this information, other member states\ncan assess whether there might be interference with\nthe frequencies they use. At least six months after\nthe advanced publication information, ITU issues\nthe coordination request. It includes a very detailed\ntechnical description of the satellite system. In case\nthe applied frequency might interfere with (existing\nor planned) other frequency usages, the member state\nconcerned can (also on behalf of its nationals) object\nto granting the requested frequency by filing an appeal\nwith the ITU.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:25 PM\n",
    "836": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\nThe ITU collects and forwards to the Federal Net-\nwork Agency these objections to the frequency appli-\ncation. The Agency is now called on to coordinate\nthe frequencies with those ITU member states which\nhave filed an appeal. The responsibility for this coor-\ndination is transferred by the Agency to the satellite\noperator who has applied for the frequency since the\noutcome of coordination has a considerable effect on\nthe detailed system design, the operational running of\nthe satellite network and economic aspects. Neverthe-\nless, the Agency assists the applicant in effecting inter-\nnational coordination insofar as the applicant lacks\nentitlement to carry out the ITU procedures, given\nthe private law status of the applicant. In particular,\nthe Agency forwards any document prepared by the\napplicant to the ITU or other member states \u201con behalf\nof Germany.\u201d The Agency assesses these documents for\nconformity with ITU rules and regulations as well as\nwith regard to the public interests involved.\n\nIn practice, the international coordination lasts\nseveral months (sometimes even years), depending on\nthe rights which have to be coordinated. In addition,\nthe applicant has to be aware that the international\ncoordination might necessitate changes in the satel-\nite system design in order to achieve compatibility\nwith other satellite systems. This calls for a flexible\nmission plan.\n\nAs soon as the international coordination is fina-\nized, the Agency notifies the results to the ITU, sup-\nplying the final satellite system design. The Agency is\nassisted by the applicant.\nThe ITU finally enters the satellite systems (especi-\nally the telecommunication links) in the Master\nnternational Frequency Register. From then on,\nthe frequency usage is protected by international\naw and must be respected by all ITU member states\n(including their nationals). The Federal Republic of\nGermany receives the right to use the orbit and the\nrequency.\n\nThe German satellite operator may now apply at\nthe Agency, which holds this right of usage on behalf\nof Germany, for a transfer of these usage rights. The\napplication must be filed at least three months in\nadvance of the scheduled launch of the satellite sys-\ntem. The transfer of the right to use the orbit and the\nfrequency is a frequency assignment, comparable to \u2014\nbut not identical with \u2014 the frequency assignment for\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:815\n\n815\n\nground segments according to $55 of the Telecom-\nmunications Act.\n\nThe rights to use the orbit and the frequency will\nbe transferred to the applicant if the frequencies are\navailable, compatible with other frequencies used\nor filed, and do not contravene public interest. The\napplicant has to prove that indeed both the orbit as\nwell as the frequency are used. The applicant also has\nto prove that the transmission does not cause inter-\nference, that there is operational control over the space\nsegment, and that competent personnel are employed.\nThe applicant finally has to assure proper operation\nof the satellite system.\n\nIf the launch of the satellite system into orbit is\npostponed, the applicant has to inform the Agency\nas soon as possible. Right after launch the applicant\nhas to inform the Agency about the launch as well as\nthe final orbital parameters. The applicant must also\nregister the space segment as a space object.\n\nThe transfer of the rights to use the orbit and\nfrequency is limited to the expected lifetime of the\nsatellite system. The tables of transmitter frequen-\ncy tolerances and maximum permitted spurious\nemission power levels have to be followed. In case\nof interference with other satellite systems or inter-\nference with other transmissions, the Agency may\nrestrict or prohibit the use of the frequency. It also\nmay revoke the transfer of rights to use this orbit\nand frequency.\n\nThe operation of the satellite for which orbit and\nfrequency rights were transferred must be planned\nso that there are enough reserves (of energy, fuel\nand functionality) to carry out decommissioning\norbital maneuvers in accordance with international\nstandards. Operating requirements may be imposed\non the party enjoying the right of use in order to\nachieve compliance with international standards on\nthe avoidance of space debris.\n\nThere are charges for both the ITU application\nand the transfer of the right of use. In addition to\nthe fees of (currently) \u20ac500 to \u20ac3500 according\nto the Frequency Fee Ordinance of the Agency, the\napplicant also has to pay the expenses for the ITU\nprocedures (currently 570 Swiss francs for the advan-\nced publication, 5560 to 33 467 Swiss francs for the\ncoordination and 15 910 to 57 920 Swiss francs for\nthe notification).\n\n2/25/09 3:37:25 PM\n",

The person is re-\nsponsible for assuring that the export control regula-\ntions can be met. To this end the person must select\nand supervise appropriate personnel and ensure that\nthey are adequately trained. The person responsible\nis personally liable for all violations of export control\nregulations.\n\nIt is forbidden to export weapons of war, to export\neconomic resources (e.g., goods, money, services,\nknow-how) to people, organizations or other entities\nlisted on the EU terrorism list, as well as to export\ninto states which are under embargo.\n\nWeapons, ammunitions or armaments which are\nnamed in the export list (Part I, Section A) and which\nare intended to be brought into another country (in-\ncluding a member state of the EU) need to be licensed\nfor export control. This is usually not relevant for\nspace industries, research centers and universities.\n\nIt is more relevant that dual-use technology also\nneeds to be licensed. Many space goods and space\ntechnologies are dual-use items. Dual-use techno-\nlogy refers to all goods (including data processing\nprograms as well as technology) which may be used\nfor both military and civil purposes. Because there\nare no launch sites on German territory, space goods\ndeveloped or assembled in Germany typically have to\nbe brought outside of Germany for launching them\ninto outer space. In order to know whether or not a\nspecific good is deemed to be a dual-use item, the\nexport list (Part I, Section C) has to be studied. This\nlist provides an exhaustive enumeration of all dual-\nuse items. It includes communication items (Category\n5 of the list), optical and radar sensors (Category 6\nof the list), propulsion devices, rockets, specific parts\nof rockets, sounding rockets and reusable launch\nvehicles (Category 9 of the list). For each of these\ncategories the list identifies technical specifications\nwhich have to be fulfilled in order to be subject to the\nexport control regime [9.4.32]. If these specifications\nare not met, the goods can be exported without a\nlicense. The export list can be downloaded from the\nInternet [9.4.33].\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nThe export list contains not only goods (to be\nfound in Category A of each section) but also tech-\nnology (to be found in Category E of each section).\nTechnology is understood to be specific technical\nknowledge which is necessary for the development,\nproduction or use of goods and products. This tech-\nnical knowledge has to be included in documents,\nnamely blueprints, schemes, diagrams, models, for-\nmulas, tables, construction plans or specifications,\ndescriptions or instructions. It has to be in writing\nor otherwise recorded, for example on magnetic disk\nor tape. Technical knowledge can also be exported\nin the form of technical assistance, namely training,\nschooling, assisting or advising. Technical assistance\ncan also be understood as the dissemination of tech-\nnical documents. Of practical importance are efforts\nof foreign nationals (non-Europeans) to establish ties\nat congresses or trade fairs. Technical knowledge may\nalso be exported in research and development pro-\njects with non-European industries, research centers\nor universities as well as in training and schooling\nprograms. It may also be exported in the exchange of\nresearchers, engineers, doctoral students and students.\nTechnical documents may also be transferred in or-\nder to enter into insurance contracts. In contrast, if\ntechnical documents are transferred in the context of\na procurement tender, the bidder is exempted from\napplying for an export control license.\n\nThe need to apply for an export control license for\ndual-use items depends only on whether or not the\ngood is listed \u2014 irrespective of which state the good is\ngoing to be exported to. Only goods brought into a\nmember state of the EU are not subject to an export\ncontrol license. In exceptional cases there is a need to\napply for an export license for goods which are not\nlisted, if the person intending to export the good has\nindications that it will have a military end use, for\nABC weapons, for missiles for such weapons or for\nnuclear purposes.\n\nPersons intending to export a listed good are as-\nked to send a preliminary application to the Federal\nOffice of Economic and Export Control (BAFA).\nThis serves to clarify whether there is a need for an\nexport control license or whether such a license can\nbe issued at all.\n\nThe license has to be applied for at the BAFA.\nThe legal basis is Regulation (EC) 1334/2000 of the\n\n2/25/09 3:37:26 PM\n",

As an EC Regulation, these rules are\ndirectly in force in every member state as national law.\nIn addition, further restrictions exist on the national\nlevel for dual-use items based on \u00a7$7 et seq. of the\nForeign Trade and Payments Act.\n\nApplication forms can be downloaded from the\nInternet [9.4.34]. The applicant has to include techni-\ncal documents, for example brochures and data sheets,\nto provide a basis for technical evaluation of the good\nor technology. In general the applicant should also\ninclude an official or private end use certificate.

In difficult cases, espe-\ncially if an embargo or a state listed in Country List K\nis involved, the procedure may last up to 12 months.\n\nInfringement of export control regulations may\nbe subject to payment of a fine of up to \u20ac500 000 or\nimprisonment up to five years, in severe cases up to\n10 years.\n\nUS export control regulations are of factual im-\nportance in the space sector in addition to German\nand European export control regulations. In many\ndomains US industry is dominant; some components\ncan only be built in the USA.\n\nThe importance of US export control regulations\nis only indirect insofar as a German entity might\nneed an export control license from the US State\nDepartment in order to export the goods from the\nUSA to Germany. But in addition, the State Depart-\nment grants this license only subject to conditions\nwith respect to the re-export of the good (including\nrelated knowledge). This means that the State De-\npartment sets conditions if the good is to be exported\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:817\n\n817\n\nfrom Germany into a third state. This is the case, for\nexample, if a component exported from the USA to\nGermany is being integrated into a satellite in Germa-\nny and this satellite is then sent to a launch site, for\nexample, in French Guiana or Kazakhstan. Although\nthe re-export of US goods without permission by the\nUSA cannot be a reason for infringement of German\nexport control regulations, there is an indirect con-\nsequence. By non-compliance indirect (economic)\npressure may be put on the German entity regarding\nfuture cooperation with US industry. This is why the\nGerman recipient of goods imported from the USA\nshould always indicate into which states it intends\nto re-export the goods (even after integration into a\nsatellite) [9.4.35], [9.4.36].\n\nLicense to Launch and Operate a Space Object\nThose states which have ratified the Outer Space\nTreaty have committed themselves to establishing\nnational procedures to authorize and supervise non-\ngovernmental activities in outer space, Art. VI (2)\nOuter Space Treaty. In any case, the operation and\ncontrol of a satellite, a probe, a platform or a space\nstation is an activity in outer space. Considering\nthe practice of states, also such activities have to be\nunderstood as being undertaken \u201cin\u201d outer space if\nthey are only partly undertaken in outer space but\ndirected toward exploration or use of outer space.\nThis includes launching activities. But according to the\nopinion of most scholars, the launching of sounding\nrockets is not included, nor are suborbital launches.\nAn activity is deemed to be \u201cnon-governmental\u201d if it\nis undertaken by a private company, a research center\nor a university.\n\nConsequently, a state has to implement a proce-\ndure to authorize and supervise activities in outer\nspace, when, for example, the first satellite operated\nby a private company or university is going to be\nlaunched into outer space. Such a procedure may be\nestablished in the context of already existing adminis-\ntrative procedures (e.g., as a condition to the decision\nto give a grant to the project of the operator). It can\nalso be part of a contractual relationship between this\noperator and the government, which might be the\ncase, for example, if the government is commissioning\nthe task to operate the satellite to a private company\n(e.g., in the context of a public\u2014private partnership).\n\n2/25/09 3:37:27 PM\n",
    "839": "CHO9.indd Sec1:818\n\n818\n\nAnyhow, it seems to be more appropriate to establish\nsuch a procedure by separate legislation, which might\nbe called national space legislation. This would be the\nmost transparent approach for the private operator,\nresearch center or university and provide the most\nlegal security.\n\nThere is no legislation in force in Germany which\ncan deal with the authorization of space activities.\nBut some private companies and universities already\nexist which operate satellites in outer space, and also\na German launch service provider launches from a\nlaunch site abroad, so that the German government\nneeds to ensure authorization of these activities by\nmeans other than legislation. Analyzing these other\nmeans, one cannot identify a coherent procedure.\n\nTaking into account the international responsibi-\nlities Germany assumed as any other state by ratifying\nthe Outer Space Treaty, and taking into account as\nwell the existing legislation abroad, certain aspects\ncan be elaborated for the contents of an authorization\nprocedure.\n\nFirst, it has to be ensured that the private entity,\nresearch center or university carries out its activities in\nouter space in conformity with those rules which are\nbinding for the state ratifying the Outer Space Treaty.\nIn this context, the state also has to ensure the safety of\nsuch activities in order to avoid damage and liability.\nAll this can be done within the authorization.\n\nThe obligation to ensure the conformity of\nnon-governmental activities with the activities of\ngovernments or governmental agencies is explicitly\nmentioned in the Outer Space Treaty, see Art. VI\n(1). The state is responsible for ensuring that non-\ngovernmental activities adhere to the principle set\nforth in the Outer Space Treaty. They have to follow\nthe same obligations which have been dealt with\nunder Section 9.4.1.1.\n\nIn the first instance, the obligation to ensure safety\nof an activity in order to avoid damage and liability\nhas a regulatory as well as a social character. But\nGermany also has a strong self-interest in avoiding\ndamage in the course of an activity in outer space.\nThis is because Germany is liable as a launching state\nfor damage caused by a space object to a third party\naccording to Art. VII of the Outer Space Treaty and\nthe Liability Convention. This liability also exists if\nGermany was not involved in the operation which\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nfinally caused the damage (e.g., collision of a priva-\ntely operated satellite with another satellite due to a\nlack of fuel at the end of its operational life), because\ninternational liability is assumed by the involvement\nof the state at the moment of launch (i.e., from the\nvery beginning of a mission) of the object into outer\nspace. Full international liability exists, in addition\nto the direct liability of the person who caused the\ndamage to the person damaged, according to national\ntort law. This was dealt with under Section 9.4.1.1.\nTherefore, it is part of the authorization procedure\nfor the operator to demonstrate its reliability, ca-\npability and technical qualification also in order\nto avoid such damage. In addition, the state ensures\nthe safety of the products used (e.g., on the basis\nof technical standards such as ISO, DIN or ECSS).\nFinally, compulsory third-party liability insurance\nis required.\n\nBesides implementing its international responsi-\nbility, according to Art. VI of the Outer Space Treaty,\nand besides ensuring the avoidance of liability, a state\nhas a third aspect of importance to consider. This\nis also out of self-interest to some extent. Based on\nan application for authorization, a state can assess\nwhether or not it is the only responsible state for the\nactivity to be authorized, or whether other states may\nbe liable for the object (satellite) which is used in such\nactivity. If it is also a launching state, it receives in the\napplication the information necessary to enter into\nnegotiations with other launching states regarding\nthe internal apportioning of damages to be paid, see\nSection 9.4.1.1.\n\nGermany not only has to authorize an activity at\nhe beginning of a mission, but also has to supervise\nit throughout its entire duration. On the basis of\negislation or by other means the state has to obligate\nhe operator to inform the responsible authority on\n\nregular basis or in case of incidents. The state also\n\nhas to ensure that it always can demand additional\ninformation as well as that it has the right to enter\nthe premises of the operator to make inspections. The\noperator might object if this is done without adequate\nlegal basis. Finally, only on the basis of a formal legal\nact can the state assess fines or other punishment\nin case of nonapplication for an authorization or\ninfringement of the terms and conditions of the au-\nthorization or the legislation.\n\nors\n\n2 ct\n\n2/25/09 3:37:28 PM\n",
    "840": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\nA special aspect of supervision is the need for the\nauthorizing authority to receive information in case the\nsatellite (with which the activity in outer space is un-\ndertaken) is to be purchased by a foreign national. This\nis because the state, being also the (liable) launching\nstate, will remain the liable launching state also after the\npurchase, as the liability is linked to the moment when\nthe launch took place. If the new (foreign) operator\ncauses damage, Germany remains liable, although Ger-\nmany cannot supervise the foreign operator. Therefore,\nthe launching state has to enter into negotiations with\nthe state which is responsible for the activity for which\nthe satellite was purchased. That foreign state should\nagree to assume liability inter partes.\n\nOperators of a satellite (or the person who wants\nto undertake a space activity) should take a close\nlook at not only the national legislation, but also the\nforeign authorization procedures. This is especially\nimportant in the context of increasing international\ncooperation, also because a German operator always\nhas to launch its satellite from abroad. Even if the\nGerman operator does not apply for the foreign\nauthorization, the mission concept can be influenced\nby the regulations which the foreign partners and\ncontractors have to follow.\n\nFormal national legislation with regard to outer\nspace activities exists as of 12 states [9.4.37]:\n\ne USA (49 USC 701 Commercial Space Launch\nActivities; CFR 14 III 400 Commercial Space\nTransportation)\n\ne Norway (Act on Launching Objects from Norwe-\ngian Territory etc. into Outer Space, 1969)\n\ne Sweden (Act on Space Activities, 1982; Decree on\nSpace Activities, 1982)\n\ne United Kingdom (Outer Space Act, 1986)\n\ne South Africa (Space Affairs Act, 1993 as amen-\nded)\n\ne Russia (Law about Space Activity, 1996 as amen-\nded; Statute No. 403 Licensing Space Operations,\n2006)\n\ne Ukraine (Ordinance on Space Activity, 1996 as\namended; Decree No. 798 on Licensing Private\nEntities undertaking Space Activities)\n\ne Australia (Space Activities Act, 1998 as amended,\nSpace Activities Regulations, 2001)\n\ne Hong Kong (Outer Space Ordinance, 1999)\n\ne Brazil (Administrative Edict No. 27, 2001)\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:819\n\n819\n\ne Belgium (Law on the Activities of Launching,\nFlight Operations or Guidance of Space Objects,\n2005)\n\ne South Korea (Space Exploration Promotion Act,\n2005).\n\nIt is know that the following states are drafting or plan\nto draft similar legislation: the Netherlands, France,\nItaly, Luxembourg, Indonesia, India, Malaysia and\nKazakhstan.\n\nAuthorization and supervision of non-governmental\nactivities is often the motivation as well as the essential\nreason for enacting national space legislation. But\nmost states have connected the legal basis for a regis-\ntration system with specific liability issues, especially\nrules on indemnifying the state which has been held\nliable as a launching state according to Art. VII of\nthe Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention.\nThese aspects will be dealt with separately in Sections\n9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.4.\n\nAuthorization of Space Vehicles as Aircraft\n\nAs long as there is no national legislation on autho-\nrizing space activities in force in Germany, operators\nshould always take aviation legislation into conside-\nration. This is because the legislator has rudimentarily\nprovided for the applicability of this legislation to\nspace activities: \u00a71 para. 2 Air Traffic Act states that\nspace vehicles, rockets and similar objects are consi-\ndered as aircraft, as long as they are in space.\n\nThis would be the basis for applying regulations of\nthe Air Traffic Act, the Air Traffic Regulation and the Air\nTraffic Approval Regulation also to space vehicles.\n\nBut the fiction established by $1 para. 2 of the Air\nTraffic Act only applies as long as the space vehicle,\nrocket or similar object is in German airspace. This\nairspace ends at an altitude of something in between\n83 and 100 km, depending on which expert opinion\none follows. Some experts argue that airspace ends at\nthe so-called Karman line, which is where the airspace\ncan still slightly support aircraft and where orbits of\nspace vehicles are also possible (physical approach).\nOthers argue for a regulatory limit of 100 km. But a\nspace vehicle is very unlikely to cross German airspace,\nas there is no launch site either in Germany or in its\nneighboring countries. Hence, the fiction is almost\nwithout any practical applicability.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:28 PM\n",
    "841": "CHO9.indd Sec1:820\n\n820\n\nIn case there should one day be an activity of a\nspace vehicle in German airspace, the fiction would\napply. Nevertheless, many regulations in the Air Traffic\nActs are not apt to apply to space activities. A space\nvehicle does not need to be certified according to \u00a72 of\nthe Air Traffic Act in combination with \u00a71 Air Traffic\nApproval Regulation. But the operator might need a\nflight crew license according to $4 Air Traffic Act, an\napproval for ascent according to $16 Air Traffic Or-\nder, as well as an approval to leave German airspace\naccording to \u00a72 para. 4 Air Traffic Act.\n\nNotification of Telecommunication Networks\n\nAs soon as public telecommunication services are\nprovided via satellites, notification is required. This\nis in addition to notification regarding the frequency\nassignment and the transfer of rights to use the orbit\nand frequency. Notification is made to the Federal\nNetwork Agency in accordance with \u00a76 of the Tele-\ncommunication Act.\n\nThe notification has to include information which\ncan identify the operator or service provider. This\ncontains, for example, its number in the commercial\nregister, physical address, a short description of the\nnetwork or service, as well as the estimated date of the\ncommencement of service.\n\nAuthorization to Operate an Advanced Remote\nSensing Satellite System\n\nOn December 1, 2007 the German Act to safeguard\nsecurity interests in the distribution of remote sensing\nsatellite data (Satellite Data Security Act) came into\nforce [9.4.38]. According to this Act the operator of\nan advanced remote sensing satellite system has to\napply for authorization. A remote sensing satellite\nsystem is deemed to be \u201cadvanced\u201d if the system is\nable to generate data of high information content.\nThis information content is determined according to\nthe spatial resolution, spectral coverage, number of\nspectral channels, etc. The exact technical limits are\ndetermined in the Remote Sensing Satellite Regulation\n[9.4.39].\n\nThe operator of such a remote sensing system has\nto apply for authorization at the Federal Office of\nEconomics and Export Control (BAFA) prior to the\nlaunch of the system. The BAFA evaluates whether\nthe operation of the remote sensing satellite system\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nmight endanger German security or foreign policy\ninterests. Therefore, the BAFA checks the reliability\nof the operator as well as the operational security. The\noperator has to ensure that the satellite system cannot\nbe commanded and data cannot be accessed by un-\nauthorized persons. Furthermore, the operator has to\nensure that no unauthorized person has admission to\nthe rooms from which the satellite system is operated\nand which are used to store and handle any associated\ndata, and that no unauthorized person has access to\nrelevant facilities therein. Persons having such access\nmust have a security clearance.\n\nThe BAFA is supported by the Federal Office of\nInformation Security.\n\nThe Act will be supplemented by an ordinance on\nfees, which has not yet been published.\n\nPermission to Act as a Data Distributor\n\nThe Satellite Data Security Act also requires a person\nwho intends to distribute advanced remote sensing\nsatellite data to apply for permission. This permission\nis granted by the BAFA.\n\nA data distributor is anybody who circulates such\ndata for the very first time to customers. The operator\nof a satellite system can also be a data distributor if\nit circulates data to persons who have not themselves\nreceived permission to act as a data distributor. Usually\nthe operator will transfer the right to use the satellite\ndata to a data distributor, who in turn will circulate\nthe data to customers. In this case, only the distributor\nneeds to apply for permission.\n\nThe BAFA evaluates (similar to the evaluations\nto authorize an advanced remote sensing satellite\nsystem) whether the distribution might endanger\nGerman security and foreign policy interests and\nwhether the data can be transferred on a secure basis.\nThis includes ascertaining the reliability of the data\ndistributor. The distributor also has to ensure that\nno unauthorized person has admission to the rooms\nrelevant to the storage, handling and distribution of\nthe data and that no unauthorized person has access to\nrelevant facilities therein. Persons having such access\nmust have a security clearance.\n\nA person who intends to distribute data is not\nobliged to apply for registration as a data distributor.\nIn that case the person is dealt with as a (simple)\ncustomer. This has the consequence that the person\n\n2/25/09 3:37:29 PM\n",
    "842": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\nonly receives data after the operator has checked the\ndata according to how sensitive it is (and if sensitive,\nthat distribution has been licensed by the BAFA). This\nwill be described in the following section.\n\nLicense to Distribute Remote Sensing Data with\nHigh Informational Content\n\nBesides the authorization to operate an advanced re-\nmote sensing satellite system and besides the approval\nto act as a data distributor, the core regulation of the\nSatellite Data Security Act requires the distributor to\napply for a license to distribute remote sensing data\nwith high informational content (if the request for\ndata is sensitive). This license is necessary for every\ndistributor who circulates data for the very first time\nto customers.\n\nOn the first level, the data distributor who intends\nto distribute data to any persons who are not them-\nselves registered as a data distributor has to perform\na sensitivity check. This sensitivity check is related\nto the request for data (and not related only to the\ncontents of the data). The sensitivity check assesses\nwhether the intended distribution of the data might\nendanger German security and foreign policy in-\nterests. This assessment is made according to the\nfollowing criteria:\n\ne Technical parameters of the data.\n\ne The sensed territory.\n\ne The time of generation of the data, the time of\ndelivery and the person to be supplied.\n\ne The ground segments to which the data is to be\nsent.\n\nThe assessment should consider the person who\nrequested the data as well as any persons who are\nintended to have access to the data. The assessment\nis made according to criteria specified in the Satellite\nData Security Regulation. These criteria can be auto-\nmatically assessed by the data distributor.\n\nThe data distributor can continue the transaction\nif the sensitivity check reveals no endangerment of\nGerman security or foreign policy interests. Not until\nthe check reveals sensitivity does the distributor have\nto decide whether to decline the transaction or apply\nfor a license from the BAFA. Here an administrative\nprocedure starts. The BAFA will ascertain whether the\ntransaction might indeed endanger national security\nor foreign policy interests.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:821\n\n821\n\nThe license procedure is supposed to be rapid, and\nif possible concluded within a month of the date of\napplication. Many applications are decided within a\nmuch shorter period. The only criteria against which\nthe application can be assessed concern whether\nthe transaction of the data would indeed endanger\nGerman security or foreign policy interests.\n\nSimilar legislation exits in the USA [9.4.40] and\nCanada [9.4.41], [9.4.42]. Only these two states cur-\nrently have advanced remote sensing satellite systems\nnot solely used for military purposes.\n\nParticular Case: Grants for Space Missions\n\nNot only licenses but also grants establish a legal\nrelationship to the state. Grants are subsidies which\nare given within the framework of the national space\nprogram [9.4.43] for space missions which are in the\nnational interest and which would not be possible\nwithout a state subsidy. The legal basis for grants is to\nbe found in $\u00a723, 44 of the Federal Budget Act.\n\nGrants are usually approved for projects and are\nsubject to reimbursement. If the mission is within the\ndomain of basic research it can be subsidized fully; if\nit is an industry mission it can be subsidized up to\n50%. Precompetitional developments may be subsi-\ndized up to 25%. The European Commission allows\nsupplements for small and medium-sized enterprises\nas well as for cooperation projects.\n\nAnybody interested in applying for a grant may\ncontact the German Space Agency within the German\nAerospace Center for advice on the feasibility and\nprospects of an application. They may then apply for\na grant. The application should include among other\nthings a description of the project, a financial budget\nand a preliminary costing.\n\nThe Space Agency will decide on the application on\nbehalf of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Tech-\nnology. It assesses the creditworthiness of the applicant\nwith respect to the costs covered by the applicant, the\nbudget in the context of grants, the financing plan\nand the feasibility of the project. It should be borne\nin mind that a grant is excluded if the applicant has\nalready started the project.\n\nThe project is monitored by the Space Agency whi-\nle it is being carried out by comparing the progress to\nthe original work, time and budget planning. Forward\nprojections as to realization are monitored as well.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:30 PM\n",
    "843": "CHO9.indd Sec1:822\n\n822\n\nThe Space Agency checks whether the grants are used\nappropriately. Accordingly, the grantee has to provide\nsupporting documents on a regular basis as well as\nfinal documentation on how the grants were used in\nthe project. The Space Agency determines whether the\nintended purpose of the grant was fulfilled.\n\nThe decision to give a grant is supplemented by a\nfixed set of terms and conditions which are not subject\nto change. For grants based on expenditures, the gran-\ntee has to follow the general terms and conditions for\ngrants subsidizing a project (ANBest-P) as well as some\nspecific terms and conditions (BNBest-BMBF 98). For\ngrants based on costs, specific terms and conditions\nexist (NKBF 98). The general terms and conditions\nmandate economical and cost-effective use of the\ngrant, and how it is to be spent. For grants exceeding\n\u20ac100.000, tenders must be sought for all contracts that\nthe grantee intends to conclude in the course of the\nproject, as if the grantee were a public entity. One of\nthe most important terms within the specific terms\nand conditions is that any intellectual property which\nmight be generated in the course of the project be own-\ned by the grantee. Ownership includes the exclusive\nright of use, but the grantee is obliged to actually use\nthis intellectual property, since it was generated in a\nproject which was financed to some extent with public\nmoney, in accord with an exploitation plan drawn up\nin cooperation with the Space Agency. The intellectual\nproperty must be used for innovation, and the grantee\nis obliged to file an application for a patent if necessary.\nHere, the grantee has to be aware that once the intel-\nlectual property has been published it is no longer a\nnew invention (and thus not patentable).\n\n9.4.2.2 Registration of Space Objects\n\nObjects which are launched into Earth orbit or beyond\nhave to be entered in a national registry. States have\nassumed the obligation to hold such a registry, see\nSection 9.4.1.1.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany has established\nsuch a registry. It is an annex to the Aircraft Registry\nwhich is maintained by the German Aviation Author-\nity (Luftfahrt-Bundesamt). As of June 2008, 31 space\nobjects were registered in the German registry.\n\nSpace objects owned by the government are re-\ngistered on the initiative of the German Aviation\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nAuthority or on notice of the Federal Ministry for\nForeign Affairs or the Space Agency within the Ger-\nman Aerospace Centre. Private space objects are so\nfar registered by the voluntary notice of the owner or\noperator. An obligation to provide information for\nregistration to the national aviation authority does not\nexist within German legislation. Aircraft are registered\naccording to \u00a73 of the Air Traffic Act in combination\nwith $14 of the Air Traffic Approval Regulation. But\nneither space vehicles nor space objects are menti-\noned in $14 of the Air Traffic Approval Regulation.\nAlso, the fiction established by \u00a71 of the Air Traffic\nAct does not apply to these norms, according to the\nwording (see above).\n\nThe \u201cobligation\u201d specified by Administrative Order\n8/2005 in the context of the transfer of orbit and\nfrequency rights (see above) to give notice of a space\nobject which is to be launched into orbit to the avia-\ntion authority can be regarded as a request for infor-\nmation only. This is because such an Administrative\nOrder cannot constitute a formal legal basis for such\nan obligation.\n\nNevertheless, it is highly recommended to give\nnotice of a space object to the aviation authority on a\nvoluntary basis. This recommendation is based on the\nimplications which registration has for several aspects\n(see Section 9.4.1.1).\n\nThe operator/owner should give notice of space\nobjects for which Germany is considered to be a\nlaunching state. A space object is an object which\nis launched (or intended to be launched) for the\nexploration or use of outer space [9.4.44], [9.4.45].\nAs the objects need to be launched into an orbit (at\nleast describing one full orbit), these typically include\nsatellites, probes, platforms as well as rocket stages\nwhich remain in orbit for a while. On the other hand,\nsounding rockets and suborbital launch vehicles are\nnot included.\n\nGermany isa launching state also for privately own-\ned/operated space objects if the object was launched\nfrom German territory or if Germany procured the\nlaunch to be carried out. As there are no launch faci-\nlities within Germany and as the German government\ndoes not own a launch site on a foreign territory, the\ncriterion \u201cto procure a launch\u201d is of special importance.\nThe interpretation of this notion was given in Section\n9.4.1.1 above. Germany procuresa launch if the German\n\n2/25/09 3:37:31 PM\n",
    "844": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\ngovernment has authorized the activity which is un-\ndertaken or if Germany was obliged to authorize\nsuch activity. It might also be the case if Germany has\notherwise contributed to launching the object; for\nexample, by providing grants to the operator/owner,\nby concluding contracts for the manufacture and/or\nlaunch of the object with the owner/operator, or by\nhaving a scientific interest in the operation of the\nobject. The notion \u201cto procure\u201d is to be interpreted\nvery widely, as can be seen. If the object is operated\nby a German national or by a German private entity\n(company, university, research center), this is an in-\ndication that Germany also procures the launching of\nthis object and therefore is a launching state.\n\nThe content of the German registry on space ob-\njects resembles the international register held by the\n(Secretary General of the) United Nations. Therefore,\nthe operator should provide the following informa-\ntion to the German Aviation Authority: the foreign\ngovernments or foreign non-governmental entities\ninvolved in the launch and operation of the object\n(in order to determine the other launching states), an\nappropriate designation for the object, the date and\nlocation of the launch, the basic orbital parameters\n(nodal period, inclination, apogee, perigee) and the\ngeneral function of the space object.\n\nAs the aviation authority only registers the object\nafter the launch took place, simple notification of that\nfact is sufficient. Nevertheless, it is recommended that\nthe aviation authority be informed in advance. This is\nbecause there will always be another launching state\nin addition to Germany (since the launch has to take\nplace from a foreign territory). Consequently, the\nGerman Aviation Authority (ideally in cooperation\nwith the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs) should\nenter into agreements with this foreign state. These\nagreements with other launching states include the\ndetermination of which launching state will register\nthe object in its national registry, since only one of\nthe launching states can do this (see Section 9.4.1.1).\nOnly when this agreement has been signed, and only\nif it identifies Germany as the launching state which\nregisters the object, can the German Aviation Aut-\nhority register the object in the annex to the Aircraft\nRegistry.\n\nThe German registry is not public. It can be ac-\ncessed by applying to the aviation authority. The\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:823\n\n823\n\napplication has to state the reasons why the infor-\nmation is needed. Other foreign national registries\non space objects are accessible, for example on the\nInternet [9.4.46], [9.4.47], [9.4.48], [9.4.49].\n\nRight after an object is registered in the German\nregistry, the aviation authority informs the Federal\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs about the registration. It\nprovides the information contained in the registry\nto the Federal Ministry. The Ministry will notify the\nSecretary General of the United Nations about the\nregistration. The Secretary General (supported by the\nOffice for Outer Space Affairs) will enter this infor-\nmation in the International Register of Space Objects,\nsee Section 9.4.1.1.\n\n9.4.2.3 Contractual Conception of a Space\nMission\n\nTo prepare and undertake a space mission requires the\noperator to enter into many contracts. The necessity\nto conclude a contract as well as the contents and\nconception of such a contract are specific to each\nparticular case and depend on many factors, such as\nwhich parts of the outer space missions are perfor-\nmed by the operator. In the following section some\nexemplary contracts are described, assuming that the\ncontracting party is the operator/owner of the space\nobject (e.g., satellite). But as the contracting parties\nenjoy the general principle of freedom of contracts,\nonly some general examples and recommendations\ncan be given.\n\nManufacture of Space Objects\n\nSpecific definition of the main contractual obliga-\ntions is the core part of a contract on developing and\nmanufacturing a space object. With regard to the\nobligations of the manufacturer, this is usually done\nin a very extensive, technical description which is\nusually annexed to the contract. But the contracting\nparties may not ignore the fact that the description\nof the main contractual obligations is an essential\nand important part of the contract itself and cannot\nbe totally allocated to an annex. The fundamental\nobligations have to be dealt with in the contract. It is\nonly the description of the (technical) details which\nmay be put into the annex. Standards exist for many\n\n2/25/09 3:37:31 PM\n",
    "845": "CHO9.indd Sec1:824\n\n824\n\ntechnical descriptions, including those for parts and\nappliances of space objects. These may be referenced\nin order to ensure high quality. DIN, CEN, ISO and\nECSS standards are of special importance. Some\nother standards for space projects also exist in the\ncontext of AECMA. Such standards are not legal acts\nand therefore not applicable as such. They have to be\nagreed upon by the contracting parties. Many space\nagencies as well as many industries (being themselves\nrepresented in Eurospace, the association of Euro-\npean space industries have voluntarily committed\nthemselves to use ECSS norms. Standards ensure not\nonly good quality but also functional integrity and\ncompatibility.\n\nWhether or not the manufacturer has fulfilled its\nobligations has to be determined according to the de-\nscriptions set forth the contract. Note that the parties\nshould agree whether the manufacturer is obliged to\nrender a service to the purchaser, or deliver a result\n(e.g., hand over a product). This is because, having\nagreed on a service, the manufacturer has already\nfulfilled its obligations as soon as it has rendered the\nservice and attempted a positive result. The parties will\nagree upon a service contract if the manufacturer is\nasked to develop a new technology (e.g., to develop a\nnew type of satellite bus). On the other hand, if the\nparties agree on a result to be achieved, the manufac-\nturer has to deliver exactly this result. It is no longer\nsufficient for the manufacturer to attempt to receive\na result. The parties will agree upon such a contract\nif a well-established product is to be manufactured,\nfor example a current type of satellite bus equipped\nwith conventional instruments. It is important to\nbe aware of which of the two types of contracts was\nagreed upon, as this determines the moment when\nthe manufacturer has fulfilled its obligations; that\nis, the moment when the purchaser can no longer\nclaim subsequent improvement or compensation\nfor damage.\n\nA manufacturer may also give a guarantee, going\nbeyond the simple obligation to render a service or\ndeliver a result. But by doing so the manufacturer\nhas to be clear that this implies additional risks. If\nthe manufacturer does not satisfy the guarantee, the\nmanufacturer will be subject to claims for compen-\nsation, even if it was not responsible for not fulfilling\nits obligations.\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nThe main obligation of the purchaser will be\npayment of a certain sum of money. The contract\nshould deal not only with the amount to be paid,\nbut also with the means of payment (e.g., fixed\nprice or reimbursement of expenses) and the terms\nof payment (milestones depending on fixed dates,\nor performance related) [9.4.50]. The purchaser\nshould monitor fulfillment of the contract in tech-\nnical reviews.\n\nThe contracting parties should always stipulate\nthe risk of delays. Space missions are typically long-\nlasting projects, which intensifies this risk. The parties\nshould allocate the risk of delays in different phases\nof the contract to the manufacturer or the purchaser.\nThe establishment of different phases makes it easier\nto amend the contract if necessary.\n\nContracts (especially on research and develop-\nment) may specify non-disclosure of information\nand know-how. This is because both parties frequently\nhave to exchange sensitive information in order to\nproperly fulfill their obligations under the contract.\nThe non-disclosure agreement should have a fixed\nterm; in exceptional cases penalty conditions can be\nstipulated.\n\nThe parties should furthermore agree on the intel-\nlectual property rights which might result from the\nproject. This includes patents, source codes, licenses,\nknow-how, etc.\n\nFinally the contract should include very general\nstipulations on the termination of the contract, ar-\nbitration, jurisdiction, etc.\n\nThe parties may agree on a letter of intent in the\nform of a Memorandum of Understanding, option\ncontract, etc. This may be necessary if there is a consi-\nderable period between the first contacts between the\nparties and the conclusion of a contract. During this\nperiod there may already be negotiations including\nan exchange of essential information and know-how,\nwhich also might give reason for expenditures.\n\nParticular Case: Contract Awarded by the German\nAerospace Center\n\nA particular situation arises if the German Space\nAgency within the German Aerospace Center awards\na contract to industry, research organizations or uni-\nversities to produce a space object. For such contracts\ngeneral terms and conditions apply. The parties also\n\n2/25/09 3:37:32 PM\n",

The Agency has to consider the budget law\nas well as the competition regulations in order to de-\nfine the right way to award the contract. Accordingly,\nthe Agency may opt for a public tender, a restricted\ntender or a single tender action (in case of delivery\nof a product or service below the threshold level of\n\u20ac130 000, or \u20ac200 000 in the case of a service involving\nresearch and development) or for an open, closed or\nnegotiated procedure (above the named thresholds).\nThe Agency prepares a detailed specification of the\nservices to be rendered, irrespective of which of the\nabove-mentioned procedures is followed. This is\nnecessary so that the applicant/tenderer can prepare\nan offer. Anyone interested in applying for tender\nstudies the newspapers, official journals, professio-\nnal journals as well as the supplement to the official\njournal of the EU because the Agency is obligated\nto publish its tenders in these organs. Sometimes,\nthe Agency may simply contact certain entities and\nask them to prepare an offer of services meeting the\nspecification. But this may only be done if a tender\nwas launched beforehand in order to prepare the list\nof participants from which the Agency then chooses\nthe entities to be contacted. The tenderer has to meet\nthe deadline for submission of the offer, as the tenderer\nwill otherwise be excluded from further consideration.\nThe offers received in time are checked on formal\nissues, after which a tender commission selects the\nmost economical offer. Whether or not an offer is the\nmost economical is decided using criteria established\nbeforehand. A weighting coefficient is determined for\neach criterion. It is not the lowest price alone which\ndetermines the outcome.\n\nThe tenderer who bids the most economical offer\nis accepted to negotiate a contract on the basis of this\noffer. The contract is usually a research and develop-\nment contract. This is the case if at least 25% of the\ncontract is on research and development issues.\n\nThe contract includes a detailed description of\nthe project, the period in which the contract is to be\nexecuted as well as an agreement about payments.\nThe kind of payment (based on costs or expenditures)\ndepends on the type of contractor: if the contractor\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:825\n\n825\n\nuses a cost calculation, the project is remunerated on\na cost basis. This applies to industry, but also to the\nFraunhofer Gesellschaft and the Helmholtz Associa-\ntion. If the contractor does not use a cost calculation,\nthe project is remunerated on an expenditure basis (all\nexpenditures have to be proved by receipts). This ap-\nplies to the Max Planck Society, universities and most\nresearch organizations. For remuneration on a cost\nbasis, the (offered) market price is to be agreed. Only\nin the case of a single tender action or a negotiation\nprocedure applied to the tender can remuneration\n(on a cost basis) be by primary costs on a fixed price\nbasis, or by primary costs on a refund basis. The\ncontractor bears the risk of additional cost if market\nprice or primary costs on a refund basis was agreed.\nIn the case of primary costs on a fixed price basis, the\ncontractor only bears the risk of additional necessary\nefforts. For remuneration on an expenditure basis,\nthe parties have to agree on a fixed price instead of a\nmarket price, or a price based on primary costs on a\nfixed price basis, or on an expenditure refund instead\nof a price based on primary cost on a refund basis.\nThe contractor must comply with ECSS standards\nin general. While these standards apply to industries\nonly by voluntary commitment or contractual refe-\nrence, the Agency is bound to these standards for all\nprojects which are undertaken in the framework of the\nnational space program. Hence, the Agency has to pass\non these obligations to all its contractors. Finally, the\ncontract includes stipulations on the termination of\nthe contract, withdrawal and other general matters.\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research\nhas specified general terms and conditions for research\nand technology contracts of the type of primary\ncosts on a refund basis (BEBF 98). These terms and\nconditions are also used by the Federal Ministry of\nEconomics and Technology for contracts concluded\nin the context of the German space program. These\ngeneral terms and conditions apply by way of analogy\nalso to contracts of the type of costs on a refund basis;\nfor contracts based on (primary) fixed costs they apply\nto a limited extent. BEBF 98 deals with issues which\nare generally applicable to research and development\ncontracts, in addition to the text of a particular con-\ntract. They are included in the contract by reference.\nBasically, they are not subject to negotiation. BEBF\n98 regulates some general matters concerning how\n\n2/25/09 3:37:32 PM\n",
    "847": "CHO9.indd Sec1:826\n\n826\n\nthe contract is to be executed. The chargeable costs\nare listed, as are the terms of invoicing and the pay-\nment itself. The terms allow for price checks by the\nprincipal. In case the contractor wants to subcontract\nobligations of the contract to another entity, BEBF\n98 provides some rules on how the contractor can\ndo so. The contractor has obligations to report to the\nprincipal. Furthermore, it is stipulated that all results\nof the research and development performance of the\ncontractor (i.e., findings, know-how, inventions, pro-\nducts) be owned by the principal. But the contractor\nmay establish an exploitation plan including a stipu-\nlation that the contractor may be entitled to exploit\nthe result in order to receive royalties. If the employees\nof the contractor invent something in the course of\nexercising the contract, the contractor as employer\nhas to claim the invention and to file a patent (before\npublishing the result/invention). BEBF 98 obliges the\ncontractor to publish the results, but not before having\nfiled a patent or protected any other (intellectual)\nproperty right. Finally, the principal accepts the result\nand produces a final report in coordination with the\ncontractor. This includes a list of potential deficien-\ncies. The contractor guarantees (for 12 months) that\nit has used state-of-the-art technology, checked the\nquality of materials, exercised competent and excel-\nlent performance as well as adhered to all warranted\ncharacteristics of the contract.\n\nParticular Case: Cooperation Agreement with the\nGerman Aerospace Center\nWhile the German Space Agency within the German\nAerospace Center can only enter into a research and\ndevelopment contract, as described above, if there is\na clear governmental need for the results, there might\nbe cases where there is a need of the result for both\nGermany and the contractor. Here the parties choose a\npublic-private partnership agreement [9.4.51]. Such\nagreements are explicitly mentioned in the German\nspace program as a specific and desired means to\nachieve the aims of the program. Public\u2014private part-\nnership agreements were used by the Agency in the\npast mainly to execute the remote sensing program.\nA public-private partnership contract reflects the\nspecial interest of both parties in the result. As in any\nother contract, the obligations and responsibilities\nof both parties have to be described as extensively\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nas possible. Again, the more technical details are an-\nnexed to the contract. This includes definition of the\nrisks which each of the parties bear in case of non-\nachievement of the results. While the ownership of the\nresults (especially patents) is with the principal in a\nresearch and development contract, the regulations in\na public-private partnership are different. Here there\nis no clear distinction made between principal and\ncontractor; that is, which party has to develop a result\nagainst payments by the other party. This is why the\nparties explicitly have to agree on who should be the\nowner of which result, on how to proceed with filing\nany results if this is possible, and who has an additio-\nnal right to use (exclusively or non-exclusively) these\nresults. A public-private partnership agreement also\nhas to include stipulations on how payments between\nthe parties are made. As there might be damage to the\nparties while the contract is executed, they should\nagree on liability clauses. It is common understanding\nin many research and development contracts on outer\nspace projects that the parties agree on a cross-waiver\nof liability. This means that none of the parties is\nallowed to claim damages from the other party. In\nGermany, such a cross-waiver has to be limited to da-\nmages which are caused by negligence or carelessness.\nFor damages caused by willful misconduct or gross\nnegligence, the other party does not have to refrain\nfrom claiming damages. The cross-waiver is intended\nto limit the (financial) risks of both parties. Finally,\nthe public-private partnership agreement contains\ngeneral stipulations on nondisclosure, publication,\ntermination and arbitration or litigation.\n\nLaunch of a Space Object\n\nA satellite or probe cannot be operated in outer space\nbefore it is launched. This transport service can be\npurchased in the marketplace.\n\nThe parties to a launch service agreement are\nusually the launch service provider and the operator\nof the object to be launched. But the operator can\nalso negotiate the above-mentioned contract for\nmanufacturing the satellite in such a way that the\nmanufacturer\u2019s obligation is not only to build and\nprovide the satellite, but also to launch and place\nthe satellite in orbit (a delivery in orbit or turnkey\ncontract). Then, it is not until the positioning took\nplace that the manufacturer has met all its obligations\n\n2/25/09 3:37:33 PM\n",
    "848": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\ntoward the principal (operator). It is the manufacturer\nwho has to enter into a launch service agreement with\nthe launch service provider.\n\nThe main content of a launch service agreement\n[9.4.52] is to attribute the risk of a launch failure or\nwrong positioning to one of the parties of the agree-\nment. This is done by several stipulations within the\nagreement, which have to be read together.\n\nThe main contractual obligations are the fol-\nlowing: While the operator is obliged to pay a certain\namount to the launch service provider (depending on\nthe rocket used, currently roughly $10 000-20 000 per\nkilogram), the launch service provider is obliged to\nlaunch the object. The agreement has to specifically\ndefine what a \u201claunch\u201d is: that is, when the launch\nservice provider has fulfilled its obligations under the\nagreement. This is important, as at this point it is not\nthe launch service provider but the operator who bears\nany risk of failure or wrong positioning. The parties\nare free to stipulate that the launch took place when\nthe rocket was ignited and took off. But they may also\nstipulate that the launch took place when the designa-\nted orbit was reached, the commissioning phase was\nfinalized, or the satellite started operation.\n\nThe risk of failure is with the launch service pro-\nvider to achieve what has been agreed. But the launch\nservice agreement differs from many other contracts\ninsofar as this risk is limited in two ways. First, a launch\nservice agreement typically includes a best effort\nclause. This specifies that the launch service provider\nis not obliged to guarantee the result (i.e., positio-\nning, or whatever has been agreed) but only obliged\nto make a best effort to achieve this result. Only if a\nstandard type of satellite bus is launched repeatedly\nwith the same rocket type might there be a reason to\nagree with the launch service provider that the result\nis guaranteed. If the agreement does not include the\none or the other clause, the launch service provider is\nusually only obliged to provide a best effort, based on\nthe applicable laws. Second, the agreement typically\nincludes a restriction, according to which the parties\nagree on a cross-waiver of liability. The launch service\nprovider only bears the risk of damages which occur\non its side (especially damage to the rocket), while\nthe operator bears the risk of the damages occurred\non its side (especially damage to the object which was\ngoing to be launched). Such a cross-waiver is usually\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:827\n\n827\n\nindependent of any stipulation made on the basic\nrisk attribution. But a cross-waiver might be void if\none of the parties caused the damage through gross\nnegligence or willful misconduct.\n\nAs a result, the launch service provider typically\nbears the risk that it does not provide the best effort\nto achieve the agreed result; in case damage occurs,\nalthough the launch service provider has provided\nthe best effort, it bears the risk for damage occurring\nto itself as well as to any third party. But the launch\nservice provider does not bear the risk for damage\ncaused to the operator, especially not damage to the\nsatellite which was going to be launched.\n\nCompared to any other type of contract on trans-\nport, the risks shared between the parties are shifted\ntoward the operator of the object to be launched. This\nis because of the likelihood of damages which might\noccur in the launch phase, but also to the uniqueness\nof each agreement, since almost every rocket has to\nbe adapted for the specific satellite bus type used. But\nthe operator has other means within the agreement\nto shift some risk back to the launch service provider.\nThe latter can agree with the operator for an unpaid\nre-launch. Hence, the operator only bears the costs\nfor rebuilding the satellite, but does not need to buy\na launch rocket for the second attempt. The operator\nalso should try to obligate the launch service provider\nto accept reviews and procedures for accepting and\napproving intermediate services performed by the\nlaunch service provider as well as to admit employees\nof the operator to the site of the launch service provi-\nder while the launch is being prepared.\n\nThe remaining risks for both parties may be (part-\nly) shifted to an insurer.\n\nIn addition to these stipulations on risk sharing,\na launch service agreement contains several other\nelements: the parties agree on definitions of essential\nterms used in the agreement, in order to achieve a\ncommon understanding (e.g., failure, partial loss, total\nloss); the launch schedule as well as the launch window\nwill be agreed upon, as well as milestones for payment\n(e.g., based on the progress of launch preparations)\nand rules for postponement of the launch. The parties\nshould also agree on which party is responsible for\napplying for authorizations (e.g., import and export,\nlaunch license, frequency allocation, registration of the\nsatellite as well as any rocket stage which might remain\n\n2/25/09 3:37:34 PM\n",
    "849": "CHO9.indd Sec1:828\n\n828\n\nin orbit for some time). It is suggested that a stipu-\nlation on how to inform all launching states is also\nincluded. A launch service agreement often includes\nthe clarification that ownership of the object which is\ngoing to be launched is not affected by its integration\nin the rocket. Questions of intellectual property rights\nas well as the transfer of know-how might also be of\nimportance to the parties. The parties might agree on\nnon-disclosure of information and termination of the\ncontract (e.g., the right of the operator to terminate\nthe contract if the rocket type which is intended to\nbe used for the launch fails in another launch which\ntakes place right before the launch which is the subject\nof the agreement).\n\nOperation of a Space Object\n\nDepending on the specific space mission, the ope-\nration of a satellite, probe, etc., gives rise to many\nlegal issues. Three of them are mentioned here as\nexamples.\n\nIf the operator is not able or does not want to\ntransmit the signals for telemetry, tracking and\ncontrol, the operator can contract this service to\nthe operator of a ground station. Even if this is not\nintended for the whole mission, it is usually done for\npositioning a satellite. This is because the coverage of\nthe central ground station might not be sufficient for\ncontacting the satellite as often as necessary to conduct\nall foreseen maneuvers and tests. Also, a ground seg-\nment can be contracted in order to download satellite\ndata because the cache capacity available on-board the\nsatellite is restricted. This is the case for many remote\nsensing activities. A contract with a ground segment\noperator must specify the obligations of both parties\n(transmission of signals or reception of data), the\nhandling of signals (authentication) and data (encryp-\ntion). The parties should also agree on backups in case\nthe ground segments contracted are not able to send\nsignals to the satellite. Finally, the parties should agree\non who is responsible for applying for the allocation\nof necessary frequencies.\n\nThe operator might need to conclude sales con-\ntracts for products and services (e.g., remote sensing\ndata, navigation signals, telecommunication services).\nAgain, the product or service to be delivered should be\ndescribed as precisely as possible, because the clients\nmay raise liability claims for breach of warranty. For\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nsome services the service provider may be able to\nnegotiate a disclaimer of warranty; for example, for\nthe case that there is an interruption in supplying na-\nvigation signals which are transmitted for no or little\nremuneration. Especially in the domain of navigation\nservices, the parties need to focus on consequential\ndamages caused by the malfunction of the signals. If\nthe service provided also includes the development of\nproducts, such as remote sensing data products, the\nparties have to conclude user (license) agreements\nfor them.\n\nIfa satellite operator is not in need of all the space\non a satellite bus, the operator may agree with other\nservice providers to integrate third-party payloads\non the satellite bus. This might be the case if a tele-\ncommunications operator only requires some of the\ntransponders on a satellite for the operator\u2019s own use\nand makes the others available to another provider.\nThis may constitute a funding source for the satellite\noperator (see below), which means that the operator\nwill enter into a rental or leasing contract. The con-\ntract should especially stipulate the conditions under\nwhich the lessee or tenant may control the leased\ntransponders irrespective of and independent from\nthe other transponders or under which conditions\nthe lessee or tenant may change telemetry, tracking\nand command signals in order to adapt the operation\nof the whole space segment to the needs of the lessee\nor tenant\u2019s own services. The transponders leased to\nanother party need to be described and located as\nprecisely as possible in order to differentiate them\nfrom the transponders owned by the operator or any\nother person. If a transponder fails in the course of the\nmission, it has to be clear who is the owner or lessee\nof that specific transponder, and the lessor and the\nlessee have to accordingly agree on who bears the risk\nof failure and to which extent this risk is borne.\n\nInsurance for Space Activities\nThe insurance market is now able to provide a number\nof different kinds of insurance for space activities.\nAny person involved in a space mission has to\nconsider whether they want to bear the technical and\ncommercial risks remaining with them according to\nthe contracts concluded, or whether they want to cover\nthese risks by taking out an insurance policy or by using\ntheir savings (which would be self-insurance). There\n\n2/25/09 3:37:34 PM\n",
    "850": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\nmight be an area where it is compulsory to take out\nan insurance policy: some national legislation requires\npersons to have third-party liability insurance.\n\nIn Germany, there is for the time being no such\ncompulsory third-party liability insurance. But\nany German operator has to realize that also foreign\nlegislation requiring such a compulsory insurance\nmight have an effect. If for example a German satel-\nlite is launched from the USA, Russia or Australia,\nthe launch (including the payload satellite) has to\nbe compulsorily insured against third-party liability\nclaims. For Ariane launches, compulsory third-party\ninsurance is required quasi by law. If a German satel-\nlite is operated by a US, Russian or UK national, the\noperation also has to be insured against third-party\nliability claims. In the USA, such insurance has to\nhave a maximum coverage equivalent to about \u20ac415\nmillion (or the maximum probable loss), in Australia\nthe equivalent of roughly \u20ac450 million (but at least\nthe maximum probable loss), in Russia the equivalent\nof between \u20ac80 and \u20ac250 million, and in the United\nKingdom the equivalent of roughly \u20ac145 million.\nAriane launches have to be insured against third-party\nliability claims to a maximum of \u20ac60 million. Similar\nrequirements exist in Hong Kong, Ukraine, South\nAfrica, Brazil and Belgium.\n\nOther insurance may be taken out on a voluntary\nbasis. Today, almost all aspects of a space mission are\ninsurable: damage caused to someone\u2019s own property,\ndamage to contractors and damage to third parties.\nThere is insurance coverage for damage occurring in\nthe course of manufacturing a satellite, its transport\nto the launch facility, its integration into the rocket,\nits launch, its positioning as well as its operation in\nouter space. To some extent, also the retention of an\ninoperable satellite in outer space (as debris) as well\nas the reentry of a satellite into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nmight be insured. The insurance might cover technical\nfailures, delays in operation, or loss of income.\n\nThe parties have to define in the insurance po-\nlicy the insured event. This includes agreement on\nwhen the parties assume damage to a satellite to be\nan interruption of business, a partial loss, or a total\nloss (which can already be the case if 51% of the ser-\nvice is unavailable). Some risks (e.g., force majeure)\nmight be excluded by the parties. The parties have to\ndetermine the amount of coverage, that is the sum\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:829\n\n829\n\ninsured and paid by the insurer in case the insured\nevent takes place. Based on the amount of coverage,\nthe parties agree upon the insurance rates which are\nto be paid. As the insurance market at the moment\nis very unstable and volatile, specific figures are very\nmuch dependent on the moment when the insurance\ncontract is concluded as well as on the peculiarities\nof the contracted space mission. Finally, the parties\ndefine the duration of coverage. For the operation of\na satellite the usual duration is currently 12 months,\nsubject to renewal.\n\nAny person intending to conclude insurance must\nthoroughly assess the risks remaining with that person.\nIf, for example, the operator of a satellite has ordered\na satellite from a manufacturer, that manufacturer is\nresponsible for delivering the satellite as specified in\nthe contract. Damage or malfunctions in this area are\nthe risk of the manufacturer. If, for example, the ope-\nrator has concluded a launch service agreement, the\nlaunch service provider has to take the risk of a launch\nfailure. But this risk is, as seen above, limited in certain\nways. If the launch service agreement stipulates that\nthe launch has taken place when the rocket has lifted\noff, and the failure happens while the satellite is being\npositioned, the operator should have insured this. If\nthe launch service agreement contains a cross-waiver\nof liability, the operator should insure for damage to\nthe satellite also occurring in the launch phase.\n\nThe negotiation of an adequate and balanced\ninsurance policy is very much dependent on the par-\nticularities of every single case [9.4.53], [9.4.54].\n\nMany (technical) details of the satellite, its pay-\nloads and the rocket have to be transmitted to the\ninsurer for calculating the amount to be covered as\nwell as the insurance rate. If the insurer is based in\na foreign state, the transmittal of such information\nmight be technology listed as a dual-use item, which\ncan be subject to export control regulation.\n\nFinancing Space Activities\n\nBefore the first income can be generated (e.g., by\nproviding telecommunication services or by selling\nremote sensing satellite data), the operator must invest\na lot of resources. The satellite usually will be built by\na manufacturer, launched by a launch service provider\nand may be tracked and commanded by a ground\nsegment operator. They all have to be paid.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:35 PM\n",
    "851": "CHO9.indd Sec1:830\n\n830\n\nOften, at the beginning of such a space mission,\nthe provider does not have many funds at its disposal.\nTherefore, the provider will enter into contracts with\npeople who can provide credit capital. This can be\ndone with a conditional sales contract concluded\nwith the manufacturer: the payment of the manu-\nfacturer will be settled by installments, the satellite\nwill be delivered to the operator upon completi-\non, but ownership of the satellite remains with the\nmanufacturer until the last installment is paid by\nthe operator. A credit agreement can also be in the\nform of a leasing contract with a bank. Instead of\nthe operator, the bank purchases the satellite from\nthe manufacturer. Hence, the bank is owner of the\nsatellite. The bank will provide the right of use to\nthe operator, and the operator has to pay leasing\ninstallments in return. Finally, a general credit agree-\nment can be concluded. A credit agreement obliges\nthe bank to provide a certain amount of payment\nto the operator, while the operator transfers several\nsecurity rights to the bank (project financing). This\nincludes an agreement according to which the bank\nbecomes the owner of some assets (e.g., the satellite)\nand transfers to the operator the right to use these\nassets (transfer by way of security). In addition the\noperator may pledge stakes in its corporation or\nentitlements of contracts to the bank, such as the\nright to use TT&C, the right to replace the operator\nin the launch service agreement, insurance rights or\nlicense agreements [9.4.55].\n\nIf the operator cannot repay the credit to the bank,\nthe bank can make use of the security interest granted\nto it: if the bank has agreed on a general credit agree-\nment the bank can liquidate the rights resulting out\nof the contracts or stakes pledged to it. If ownership\nin the satellite was transferred to the bank, the bank\nmay terminate the right of the operator to use the\nsatellite. It may then sell the satellite to a third party.\nIf the manufacturer has agreed upon a conditional sale\nor leasing agreement, it can terminate this agreement.\nIt may then transfer the right to use the satellite to a\nthird party or even sell the satellite.\n\nBoth the bank and the manufacturer, who are own-\ners of a satellite by way of the transfer of security in-\nterests, have to consider that the exercise of remedies\n(e.g., to sell the satellite) can proceed only according\nto law. The parties cannot deviate by contract. The\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nbank faces difficulties especially with regard to mo-\nbile equipment, such as satellites: the remedies may\nonly be exercised by the laws of the state, where the\nequipment is located at the moment of default (i.e.,\nthe operator is no longer able to pay the credit install-\nments). The bank and the manufacturer will have to\ntake this uncertainty into account when defining the\namount of credit paid in respect to the amount of the\ninstallments. Therefore the parties should know into\nwhich states the equipment might be brought. For\nsatellites, the places of manufacturer, transport and\nlaunch are important.\n\nFrom a legal point of view, there will be difficul-\nties in defining the law applicable to the exercise of\nremedies when the satellite has been launched and\nplaced in outer space. According to the above, the laws\nof the state where the equipment is located applies.\nBut as also noted above, outer space is international\nterritory (Art. II of the Outer Space Treaty), which\nalso excludes the application of national laws. Some\nscholars argue that for the exercise of remedies the\nlaws of the state apply in which the satellite has been\nregistered. This is because this state of registry retains\njurisdiction over and control of the object according to\nArt. VIII of the Outer Space Treaty. This \u201cjurisdiction\nand control\u201d includes application of the national laws,\nso they argue. According to other scholars, the laws\nof the state where the main ground segment (control\nstation) is located apply [9.4.56].\n\nThis legal uncertainty may be overcome in the\nmedium term. The UNIDROIT Convention on secu-\nrity interests in high-value mobile equipment (Cape\nTown Convention) provides for a harmonization of\nthe national laws on security interests. States ratifying\nthis Convention are called to amend their national\nlaws according to the rules of the Convention. The\nmore states have done so, the less uncertainty re-\nmains for banks concerning how to exercise remedies\nin foreign states. The Cape Town Convention today\nonly applies to aircraft, engines and helicopters. It\nwill soon be applicable to railways and railway wa-\ngons. And it might become applicable to satellites\nand other space objects through ratification of a\nprotocol on space assets [9.4.57]. This protocol is\nstill under negotiation and some important ques-\ntions (e.g., to which assets the protocol applies) are\nstill unanswered.\n\n2/25/09 3:37:35 PM\n",
    "852": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\n9.4.2.4 Liability Risks\n\nEvery participant in a space mission should be aware\nof liability risks in the course of the mission. These\nshould be considered at the very beginning. In addi-\ntion, it has to be decided which of these risks should\nbe insured.\n\nA space mission is subject to ordinary liability\nrisks, just as any other activity. But there are additional\nliability risks which have to be taken into account.\n\nFirst, the activity is subject to the typical liabilities\nresulting from the laws as well as from all concluded\ncontracts. If a contracting party does not meet its\ncontractual obligations the contracting partner may\nclaim compensation for damage. The same applies if\na contracting partner does meet its obligations, but\nincompletely or incorrectly or only after a delay. If a\nthird party is damaged in the course of the missi-\non, this third party may claim for compensation of\ndamages according to the law (tort law). The party\ndamaged is entitled to compensation for every finan-\ncial loss which occurred, irrespective of whether the\nclaim is based on a contract or on the laws. The party\nwho caused the damage has to reestablish the situation\nas it was before the damaging event took place. This\ncompensation may be done by repairing the damage.\nBut usually compensation takes place by payment of\na certain sum of money.\n\nSome contractual liabilities may be excluded by\nthe parties. A cross-waiver of liabilities for damages\nwhich were not caused through gross negligence or\nwillful misconduct is very typical in the context of\nresearch and development contracts.\n\nBasically, a contractual liability can only be clai-\nmed if the damage is based on the fault of one con-\ntracting party. Fault is given if the damage was caused\nwillfully or by negligence. The legislation may, howe-\nver, specify that for certain activities liability is also\ngiven without fault. This is called strict (absolute)\nliability. The reason for such a legislative decision\nmay be that an activity is deemed to be basically\ndangerous. A strict liability implies a higher liability\nrisk: a person damaged does not need to prove that\nthe person responsible for the damage has caused the\ndamage by fault. A strict liability exists, for example in\nair traffic law for the operation of an aircraft ($3 of the\nGerman Air Traffic Act), but not for space activities.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:831\n\n831\n\nHowever, some other states have implemented in their\nnational legislation a strict liability for the launching\nand reentry of space objects. The reasoning is that a\nsimilar concept applies in international law, since the\nlaunching state is absolutely liable for damage caused\nby space objects on the Earth or to aircraft in flight,\nsee Art. II of the Liability Convention.\n\nMany space activities are conducted under inter-\nnational cooperation. This may raise the question of\nwhich national law is applicable to liability issues.\nEvery contract should therefore include a clause\nagreeing on the applicable law. If the parties have not\nagreed on this, the law of the place where the con-\ntractual obligation was accomplished is applicable.\nIf a third party is damaged in the course of a space\nmission and the context is international, the parties\ncannot agree on the applicable law. The claims are\nhandled according to the laws of the state in which\nthe damage occurred.\n\nFor damages caused to third parties some specifics\nhave to be taken into account. A person damaged\nmay directly claim for compensation from the person\nwho caused the damage. In addition, a liability of the\nlaunching state exists according to the international\ntreaties (Art. VII of the Outer Space Treaty, Arts. I-IV\nof the Liability Convention). The person damaged\nmay choose whether to claim against the person who\ncaused the damage or against a launching state. The\nliability of the launching state is not linked to the\nfactor which caused the damage, but only to the par-\nticipation of that state in the event of the launch. This\ninternational liability also exists when the damage is\ncaused years later in the course of operation or reentry\nof the object into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. And this\ninternational liability also exists if the damage was\ncaused by the operator. If the person damaged chooses\nto claim against a launching state, this state might be\ninterested in taking recourse against the operator or\nany other person who caused the damage. This can be\ndone only if there is a legal basis in the national laws.\nThis is the case in some states (e.g., Russian Federa-\ntion, USA, United Kingdom and Australia). Most of\nthese states have at the same time limited this recourse\nto a certain amount of money, typically the amount\nof the compulsory third-party liability insurance of\nthe operator. This leads to insurability of the activity\nand also provides some financial protection for the\n\n2/25/09 3:37:35 PM\n",
    "853": "CHO9.indd Sec1:832\n\n832\n\nnational industry. In Germany there is actually no\nlegal basis for such recourse.\n\nFor any person launching or operating a space\nobject, the additional international liability of the\nlaunching states has a positive effect. It can be of ad-\nvantage for the operator who caused damage toa third\nparty if this third party does not claim compensation\nagainst the operator but against a launching state. This\nlaunching state may indeed take recourse against the\noperator. But this recourse is often limited. Then the\noperator and the launching state(s) share the liability.\nOtherwise, in case there is a direct claim of the third\nparty against the operator, the operator has to fully\ncompensate the third party.\n\nAnother specific aspect of liability issues in outer\nspace is the treatment of space debris. Space debris\nconsists of human-made objects which are in outer\nspace but which have lost their function of using or\nexploring outer space. Debris may also include former\nparts of a space object. The avoidance and mitigation\nof space debris is an important and current topic in\nmany fora. Many approaches are taken. The most\nfamous might be the approach of the Inter-Agen-\ncy Space Debris Coordination Committee. It has\ndeveloped rules which are widely used as technical\nstandards.\n\nIf damage occurs despite all efforts to avoid or\nmitigate debris, the question arises whether or not the\n(former) operator is liable for such damage. Liability\ndoes not end with the termination of operation. Space\ndebris is also regarded as an object which was once\nlaunched for the purpose of using or exploring outer\nspace. The launching states are liable regardless of the\nfunctional status of the object. Their liability is given\nbecause of their involvement at the very moment of\nthe launch. If space debris later causes damage and\nif this damage even was caused after reentry into\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere or to aircraft in flight, the\nlaunching state is absolutely liable (see Art. II of the\nLiability Convention). Otherwise it is fault liability\n(Arts. III, IV of the Liability Convention), but fault is\nalready given if technical standards for avoidance or\nmitigation of debris were not followed, either willfully\nor by negligence.\n\nTo the same extent the (former) operator is also\nliable for damages caused by space debris. If the (for-\nmer) operator has willfully or by negligence omitted\n\n9 Management of Space Projects\n\nto consider measures to avoid damage (e.g., to put the\nobject into a graveyard orbit or to bring the object to\na controlled re-entry), this may cause liability.\n\nAny operator who has the right to use frequency\nand orbital position because of a transfer of such\nrights by the Federal Network Agency are subject to\na condition that sufficient fuel has to be retained in\norder to allow orbital maneuvers to terminate ope-\nration. Satellites in a geostationary orbit should be\nbrought into a graveyard orbit or caused to reenter the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere according to 3.7 of Administrative\nOrder 8/2005.\n\n9.4.3 Space Activities in the\nFramework of the EU and ESA\n\nEuropean activities in outer space have never been\nexclusively national, bilateral or trilateral activities.\nThere has always been a European dimension. This\nEuropean dimension is also of relevance for every pri-\nvate entrepreneur, university or research institution.\nEvery decision taken in the framework of the ESA as\nwell as in the framework of the EU has implications\nfor their activities. Especially those decisions which are\nof a political and programmatic character and which\ndefine their mid-term perspectives can influence the\nstrategy of such non-governmental entities. It might\nbe interesting for them to orientate according to these\ngovernmental perspectives, as there might be financial\nsupport forthcoming in the form of grants. Since these\ndecisions define areas in which the EU or ESA might\nassign contracts to national industry, university or re-\nsearch organizations in the future, it is recommended\nthat these decision-making processes on political and\nprogrammatic issues at the European level be closely\nfollowed to the same extent that the same processes\nat the national level are followed.\n\nBoth the EU and ESA have meanwhile become\nactors in outer space. But both have to be strictly\ndifferentiated, also because of their different histories.\nThey will therefore be described separately.\n\nThe main decisions within ESA are made by the\nCouncil at ministerial level. This Council is convened\nevery two to four years. It is within this Council that\nthe ESA member states agree on the basic political\nprinciples of the organization\u2019s space policy. At the\n\n2/25/09 3:37:35 PM\n",
    "854": "9.4 Legal Aspects of Space Activities\n\nsame time the member states designate the amount\nof their participation within the (optional) program\nlines of ESA; that is, how much money states will\ntransfer to ESA for executing the programs. As ESA\nis based on the principle of geo-return, by deciding\non the amount of money to be transferred to ESA, the\nmember states decide at the same time about the per-\ncentage of money which is going to be retransferred\nto their national industry (universities and research\norganizations). This principle basically says that if\na member state pays a certain percentage of money\nfor a defined program, the same percentage value of\ncontracts has to be concluded with entities of that\nsame state for executing this program.\n\nThe main decisions within the EU are made by the\nCouncil and the Parliament or within the European\nCommission. Outer space activities will be explicitly\nmentioned for the first time in the basic treaties of\nthe EU when the EC Treaty as amended by the Lisbon\nTreaty enters into force. Therein the competence for\ncarrying out space activities (especially the definition\nand implementation of programs) will be shared\namong the EU and the member states. The EU is\ncalled on to draw up a European space policy and\nto establish the necessary measures, which may take\nthe form of a European space program, excluding\nany harmonization of the laws and regulations of the\nmember states.\n\nOn another level, the European Commission\n(which is, broadly speaking, the Executive) has de-\ncided on some basic principles on space published\nin its White Paper entitled \u201cSpace: a new European\nfrontier for an expanding Union. An action plan for\nimplementing the European space policy.\u201d The White\nPaper implements European space policy (which is a\npolicy at the EU level and should not be confused with\nthe European Space Policy which recently was agreed\nbetween the EU and ESA, see below). Global Moni-\ntoring for Environment and Security (GMES) as well\nas Galileo have a central role within the White Paper,\naccompanied by issues on digital divide, outer space\nfor common security and defense policies, monito-\nring conflict areas from outer space and monitoring\ncompliance with international treaties and agreement\n(e.g., treaties on disarmament). Cooperation between\nthe EU and ESA as well as with the Russian Federation\nis explicitly mentioned within the aims of the policy.\n\nCHO9.indd Sec1:833\n\n833\n\nBesides naming these aims, the White Paper also de-\nfines key elements for achieving them: Europe has to\nachieve strategic independence from other spacefaring\nnations, especially with regard to parts and compli-\nances for space objects as well as with regard to access\nto space; the focus is to be on technologies which are of\nspecial importance for future developments, and the\nexploration of outer space and scientific education are\nconsidered to be essential elements. Also on the level\nof the European Commission, the 7th Framework\nProgram should be mentioned here. This program\nstarted in 2007 and defines the areas in which the\nEuropean Commission commissions (outer space)\nresearch activities to European industries, universi-\nties and research organizations. Tendering for these\ncontracts is in full and open competition.\n\nCooperation between the EU and ESA has grown\nin recent years, despite their different histories and\ntasks, almost conflicting industrial policies and some\ndifferences in their member states [9.4.58]. This\nwas decided by the Council of ESA as well as by the\nCouncil of the EU. Based on these decisions, coope-\nration was formalized in common resolutions of the\nESA and EU Councils on a common European Space\nPolicy and on a Framework Agreement for further\ncooperation. The core stipulation of the Framework\nAgreement is basically that both continue to execute\ntheir tasks based on their own internal procedures, but\nundertake cooperation in scientific activities, techno-\nlogies development, remote sensing, navigation, tele-\ncommunication, human space activities, microgravity\nresearch and launching activities. In practical terms,\nthe EU participates in the optional ESA programs of\nGalileo. Galileo is the first huge program in which both\nbodies cooperate. The second program will be GMES,\nwhich is currently being executed by ESA only, but\nis intended to be transferred to the EU in late 2008.\nFinally, the Framework Agreement is the basis for the\ndevelopment of a common European Space Policy. In\npreparation of this policy, a new body was created, the\nSpace Council, which is broadly speaking a union of\nthe Councils of the EU and ESA.\n\nWhether and to what extent the cooperation\nbetween the EU and ESA will be extended to include\norganizational issues is still written in the stars. Diffe-\nrent models are being discussed. These discussions are\ngoing to be very specific, but in broad terms whether\n\n2/25/09 3:37:36 PM\n",
