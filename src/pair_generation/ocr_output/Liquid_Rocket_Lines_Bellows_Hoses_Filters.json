    "1": "| FOREWORD\nNASA experience has indicated a need for uniform criteria for the design of space vehicles.\nAccordingly, criteria are being developed in the following areas of technology:\nEnvironment |\n| Structures\nGuidance and Control |\n| Chemical Propulsion\nIndividual components of this work will be issued as separate monographs as soon as they\nare completed. This document, part of the series on Chemical Propulsion, is one such\nmonograph. A list of all monographs issued prior to this one can be found on the final pages\nof this document. |\nThese monographs are to be regarded as guides to design and not as NASA requirements,\nexcept as may be specified in formal project specifications. It is expected, however, that\n| these documents, revised as experience may indicate to be desirable, eventually will provide\n| uniform design practices for NASA space vehicles.\nThis monograph, \u201cLiquid Rocket Lines, Bellows, Flexible Hoses, and Filters\u201d, was prepared\n| under the direction of Howard W. Douglass, Chief, Design Criteria Office, Lewis Research\nCenter; project management was by M. Murray Bailey. The monograph was written by C. M.\nDaniels, Rocketdyne Division, Rockwell International Corporation and was edited by\nRussell B. Keller, Jr. of Lewis. Significant contributions to the text were made by T. Nelson, |\nJ. R. Rollins, and L. Sack of Rocketdyne Division, Rockwell International Corporation.

    "3": "| GUIDE TO THE USE OF THIS MONOGRAPH\n\n| The purpose of this monograph is to organize and present, for effective use in design, the\nsignificant experience and knowledge accumulated in development and operational\nprograms to date. It reviews and assesses current design practices, and from them establishes\nfirm guidance for achieving greater consistency in design, increased reliability in the end\n\n| product, and greater efficiency in the design effort. The monograph is organized into two\nmajor sections that are preceded by a brief introduction and complemented by a set of\nreferences.\n\n\u2018 The State of the Art, section 2, reviews and discusses the total design problem, and\nidentifies which design elements are involved in successful design. It describes succinctly the\n\n{ current technology pertaining to these elements. When detailed information is required, the\n\nbest available references are cited. This section serves as a survey of the subject that provides\n\n| background material and prepares a proper technological base for the Design Criteria and\n\n| Recommended Practices.\n\nThe Design Criteria, shown in italics in section 3, state clearly and briefly what rule, guide,\n\n| limitation, or standard must be imposed on each essential design element to assure\n\n' successful design. The Design Criteria can serve effectively as a checklist of rules for the\nproject manager to use in guiding a design or in assessing its adequacy.\n\n| The Recommended Practices, also in section 3, state how to satisfy each of the criteria.\n\n: Whenever possible, the best procedure is described; when this cannot be done concisely,\n\n| appropriate references are provided. The Recommended Practices, in conjunction with the\n\n| Design Criteria, provide positive guidance to the practicing designer on how to achieve\n\n| successful design.\n\n| Both sections have been organized into decimally numbered subsections so that the subjects\nwithin similarly numbered subsections correspond from section to section. The format for\nthe Contents displays this continuity of subject in such a way that a particular aspect of\n\n| design can be followed through both sections as a discrete subject.\n\n| The design criteria monograph is not intended to be a design handbook, a set of\n\n| specifications, or a design manual. It is a summary and a systematic ordering of the large and\nloosely organized body of existing successful design techniques and practices. Its value and\nits merit should be judged on how effectively it makes that material available to and useful\n\n| to the designer.\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\niii |\n|\nI\n",

INTRODUCTION\n| A liquid-propellant rocket engine and the vehicle for which it provides a propulsive force\n\nrepresent an assemblage of fluid-flow components that must be interconnected if the\n\ncomponents are to perform their respective functions. These interconnections are provided |\nby the lines, bellows, and flexible hoses used on a typical rocket propulsion system. The\n\nfluids in a given system are maintained at a required level of cleanliness by filters that\n\nremove contaminant material.\n\nA line (or duct) is an enclosed leak-tight passageway that conveys fluid from one\n| fluid-system component to another. (The terms \u201cline\u201d and \u201cduct\u201d are used interchangeably\n| in the aerospace industry and will be so used in this monograph.) A bellows is a thin-wall\ni circumferentially corrugated cylinder that when integrated into a line can accommodate line\nmovement through deflection of the corrugations (convolutions). A bellows joint normally\n\nconsists of a bellows and a restraint linkage, but it may be only a free bellows. Flexible hose\n\nconsists of a corrugated (convoluted) innercore restrained by an outer sheath or wire braid. |\n\nA filter is a device that removes contaminants from a fluid system by trapping particulate\n\nmatter within or on the surface of porous material; criticality of most rocket engine\n\ncomponents requires filtration to some degree for almost all control fluids prior to their\nentry into valves, actuators, and other fluid-system components.\n\nThe successful design of line or duct assemblies and their components is based on many\n\nconsiderations and factors. Some considerations are quite basic and are well grounded in\n\ntheory, while others are more subtle and have been learned through many failure analyses\nand experiments.\n\n| Flexibility is designed into a line assembly so that it can accommodate deflections imposed\nby various conditions such as thermal expansions and contractions, installation\nmisalignments, operational structural deflections, and thrust-vector gimballing. The most\ncommon method for providing flexibility is to incorporate in the line a bellows ora section |\nof flexible hose or combinations thereof. A second method is to provide a hard line (no hose\nor bellows) with sufficient flexibility to absorb the imposed deflections, flexibility being\nachieved by special attention to line configuration, location of elbows, length-to-diameter\n\n|\n\n|\n\ni}\n",
    "14": "ratio, and line material properties. In some instances (e.g., the Titan I engines), rotating )\njoints with dynamic seals have been used, but to a much lesser extent than bellows joints or |\n\u201cflexible\u201d hard lines.\nThe major problems in line assemblies have involved the details of the flexible-joint elements\nutilized. Less frequent problems have involved the entire assembly and include mechanical |\nvibration, corrosion, contamination, thermal-cycling fatigue, static-seal leakage, handling\ndamage, and mismade parts. The major problems with the flexible elements, in addition to |\nthose just listed, have been fatigue failures (from flexure and mechanical or flow-induced\nvibration), buckling-instability failure, and failure of the duct-to-bellows attachment joint. |\nThe major problems in filter design have been determining the amount of built-in,\nsystem-generated, and environmental contaminants to be filtered; contaminant capacity;\nflow versus pressure drop for filter elements; and the physical size of filter required to\nsatisfy the system requirements.\nThis monograph begins with a discussion of the line assembly that treats the key design\nelements in the assembly in the logical, chronological order in which a designer would\n| proceed. Bellows (including linkages, liners, and associated components), flexible hoses, and |\nfilters then are treated in order. Some of the design considerations in these areas overlap. |\nFor example, similar considerations apply to the design of line assemblies with flexible |\njoints and to the design of a flexible-hose assembly; also, considerations for design of a !\nbellows in a flexible joint are similar to those for a bellows in a flexible-hose innercore.\n|\nBecause the materials-selection factors, handling-protection devices, test requirements, and ;\ntest instrumentation are very similar for lines, bellows, and flexible hoses, this information is |\npresented only once in the section \u201cLINE ASSEMBLY.\u201d Filters, while not intimately\nrelated to ducting, are a critical part of a rocket engine fluid system; they are discussed\nseparately and last in the monograph.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n",
    "15": "2. STATE OF THE ART\nLines, bellows, and flexible hoses. \u2014 Table I* presents the chief design features of lines\nbellows, and hoses in typical uses on representative operational and advanced-development\nengines and vehicles. In the design and application of these components, many problems\nwere solved; some problems still exist and have at best only partial solutions.\n|\nFlexible lines are more prevalent on large liquid rocket engines (booster or upper-stage main\n| propulsion) than on small engines (attitude control or reaction control). Small engines\nseldom have exterior lines except for propellant feedlines. Little flexibility is required in\nthese lines because the engines usually are not gimballed and utilize storable**\n| (noncryogenic) propellants. The state of the art of rocket engine flexible lines thus is based\nprimarily on experience with large engines. Figure 1 shows the line, bellows, and hose |\nassemblies on a typical large pump-fed engine (J-2). |\nEarly launch vehicles, as characterized by the Vanguard and Redstone, had relatively low\nengine thrust and operating pressures. The flexible-line design problems were solvable within\n| the state of the art. Free bellows, restrained only by their installation attachment points, |\n| were used for achieving flexibility in the propellant feed systems. The materials used for\n| both bellows and feedlines were stainless steels of the 18-percent-chromium,\n8-percent-nickel family (18-8 CRES).\nPropulsion systems for later launch vehicles (e.g., Jupiter, Thor, Atlas, and Titan) included\ngimballed engines with greater operating pressures and larger line sizes than those on the\nRedstone or Vanguard. Flexible lines were more sophisticated and required considerably\n| more development; 18-8 CRES remained as the predominant type of material, however.\nThe engines of the Saturn vehicles and the associated propellant feed systems presented\nsevere design requirements in flexible ducting. Advances in the state of the art were\nnecessary to meet those requirements. Line sizes, operating pressures, flow velocities, and\ngimballing life \u2014 all far exceeded anything previously done. Higher strength materials were\nnecessary to minimize structural weights and to provide adequate fatigue life. The hardware,\n| being man-rated, had to be extremely high in reliability; reliability was proved through\n| many component, engine, and unmanned-flight tests.\n| The Saturn vehicle systems made extensive use of the pressure-volume-compensator (PVC)\ntype of duct assembly. This design concept was not used on any engines or vehicles prior to\n| the Saturn. Tension-type systems, which include PVC ducts, are the predominant systems\n| on the Saturn. The free-bellows compression system also was frequently used; examples are\n\u201cFactors for converting U.S. customary units in the table to the International System of Units (SI units) are given in\nAppendix A.\n**Terms and symbols, materials, and abbreviations are defined or identified in Appendix B. |\n3 |\n'\n",

    "22": "the LOX suction ducts (non-gimballing) and fuel drain duct on the S-1C and the pump inlet\nducts on the J-2 engine.\n|\nWith the advent of the Space Shuttle Program (ca. 1969), the specifications for hardware |\n| design included one new feature never before required for space vehicles: reusability. The |\n| Space Shuttle must be capable of performing 100 missions. This requirement introduced the\nneed for longer low- and high-cycle fatigue lives, improved long-term corrosion resistance, a\n| greater number of gimballing cycles for articulating ducts, and ease of maintenance and\n| refurbishment. For example, some of the flexible vacuum-jacketed lines in the Shuttle\nOrbiter main propulsion system are made entirely of Inconel 718 for long-term resistance to |\n| damage and corrosion; in comparison, in the Saturn vehicle lines only the basic bellows were\nmade of this material. In addition, the high chamber pressure of the Space Shuttle main\nengine (3000 psi, three times greater than any previous operational rocket engine), with\npump discharge pressures in excess of 7000 psi and pressures in the articulating flex ducts |\n| greater than 5000 psi, made necessary a giant step in the state of the art for the design and |\nfabrication of components for service with high-pressure fluid.\nBoth the long calendar-life requirement (10 years) of the Space Shuttle and the earlier |\nestablished long-life requirements for unmanned missions to the outer planets make |\nconsideration of the long-term aspects of materials selection in component design a must.\nFor example, caution must be exercised in using plastic materials beyond a two-year life. '\nReal-time tests are required to prove life compatibility of materials; accelerated tests are not |\nrepresentative.\n| Filters. \u2014 Recognition of the need for filter protection of critical control components {\n| occurred with testing of the Redstone engines. Periodic disassembly or disconnecting of\ncontrol lines and replacement of components permitted contamination to enter the engine\n| system. Failures of components, generally because of excessive leakage, were traced to the |\ncontamination that had been introduced during the periods of disassembly. In subsequent\nengine programs (Jupiter, Atlas, Thor, Saturn, Space Shuttle), filters were recognized as |\nbeing vital components in all systems containing contamination-sensitive control |\n| components.\n| Commercial filters were used initially, but as engine requirements became more stringent\ninsofar as envelope and line connections were concerned, specifications to control these\n| features were generated. Filter specifications subsequently were expanded to control such\nitems as allowable pressure drop, material compatiblity, construction features, filter\nmaterial, and cleanliness requirements.\nThe majority of filters are made of metallic wire cloth or stacked etched metallic disks;\nvarious metals are used, but stainless steel is most common. Most filters have been wire-mesh\n| types because, in comparison with stacked etched disks, they offer maximum surface area |\n| for minimum weight and can handle high flowrates. Metallic-disk types have been restricted |\n|\n[ 10 {\n| |\n|\n1\n| |\n| |\ni}\n",
    "23": "largely to relatively small engines with low flow requirements. Chief design features of\nwire-mesh filters used in various rocket engine systems are summarized in table II. The\npropellants and pressurizing gases supplied to the engine are controlled with respect to\nmoisture and hydrocarbon content, and additional devices such as absorptive separators are\nnot necessary.\n| |\n2.1 LINE ASSEMBLY\n| As noted, the line (or duct) assembly may be either a combination of hard lines and flexible\nelements (bellows joints or flexible hoses) or a completely hard line that achieves flexibility\n| through the use of bends and material elasticity. Basic design considerations in establishing a |\nline configuration are routing, sizing, pressure-drop and vibration control, and location and\n| type of flexible joints; other considerations include materials, cost, weight, reliability, and\n| maintainability. References 1 through 5 present details on line-system design.\n| Flexible lines. \u2014 A typical flexible-line assembly consists of tubular straight runs and\n| elbows, with flexible bellows joints located along the line, separable connectors with static\n] seals at either end for installation into mating components, and branch-off line connections. |\nFlexible-line assemblies have been utilized successfully in sizes from '%4-in. diameter to 27-in.\n; diameter, at temperatures from -455\u00b0F (liquid helium) for pressurization systems and\n-423\u00b0F (liquid hydrogen) for propellants to + 1300\u00b0F (turbine-exhaust gases), with pressures\nranging from vacuum to 3000* psi, and with every cryogenic- and storable-propellant\ncombination successfully used in rocket engines. There are two basic flexible-line\n| configurations: the tension type (fig. 2), and the compression type (fig. 3).\n| The tension-type system utilizes bellows restrained by linkages that withstand the pressure\nseparating load (i.e., the axial load due to the force generated by internal pressure that\ntends to separate the ends of the bellows); the linkages may be either external or internal\nand permit angular motion. The line routing requires two or more bends with bellows joints |\nlocated between bends. Overall length changes in the line assembly are accommodated\nthrough angulation of the flexible joints. |\n| :\n] Figure 2 presents two examples of tension-type configurations: the three tension-tie bellows |\njoints in a dog-leg arrangement, and the axial bellows with two tension-tie bellows joints. In\nthe three-tension-tie configuration (fig. 2(a)), one end of the duct is capable of |\nthree-dimensional movement and angulation in any plane with respect to the other end. The\nduct is shortened by angulation of the individual flexible joints. In the axial bellows (fig.\n2(b)), angulation and shear motion of one end with respect to the other are accommodated\nby two tension-tie bellows joints. Necessary changes of length are achieved with a\nthrust-compensating bellows joint. This configuration usually is employed when large axial\n} deflections are necessary (e.g., in the inlet ducts of a gimballed pump).\n| \u201cup to 5500 psi in the advanced-development SSME.\n11\n|\n| ii\n",

    "27": "The compression-type duct system (fig. 3) utilizes free bellows (i.e., no tension-tie linkage\nacross the bellows) to absorb the deflections imposed on the duct during operation. The\npressure separating loads on the bellows are reacted by supporting engine or vehicle\nstructure. In addition, support bracketry may be required to offset column buckling if the\nducting has a large length-to-diameter ratio (> 1). If the operating pressures are high and\nlines are large, the pressure separating forces are correspondingly large, and restraint\nstructure becomes necessarily heavy. Consequently, the compression-type system, although\nwidely used, generally is limited to low-pressure (< 400 psi) applications such as the inlet\n| ducts of the engine propellant pumps.\nExamples of compression-type configurations shown in figure 3 are the single bellows and\nthe double-bellows spoolpiece. A single free bellows (fig. 3(a)) can be utilized to absorb all |\n; motions (angular, shear, or axial) when short-coupled components are to be connected\nand when the line pressures and motion requirements are relatively low. In this\n| configuration, the pressure separating load on the bellows is resisted by the end-mounting\nstructure. The bellows of necessity will be long enough to accommodate all motions\n| simultaneously. This length could lead to buckling instability, but bellows can be stabilized\nby external linkages if increased weight and size are not critical considerations. A\n{ double-bellows spoolpiece configuration (fig. 3(b)), which is similar to the single bellows, can\nbe used in applications where greater shear (offset) motion is required and sufficient space\n{ to accommodate the increase in length is available. The turbine exhaust ducts of the engines |\non Thor, Atlas, and Saturn vehicles incorporate compression-type bellows. They are |\nacceptable for use in these systems because the ducts are straight and relatively short and\n| the operating pressure is low.\nHard lines. \u2014 Hard lines (lines with no bellows or flexible hose to act as flexible members)\nmay be used in non-gimballing applications where line flexibility is required only to\n| accommodate installation misalignment and thermal expansion or contraction. Because hard\nlines are quite rigid in comparison with lines with bellows joints, they must be custom-made\n| to fit the particular installation, or specially sized spacers must be used at the separable\nconnectors to make up installation tolerances. The feature of installation interchangeability\n\u2018 that is inherent in ducts with bellows joints thus is sacrificed with hard lines. Material\n| selection, wall thickness, and routing are the variables available to the designer for achieving\n| flexibility necessary to accommodate thermal deflections and deflections resulting from\nengine operation or in-flight forces. Figure 4 depicts some common hardline configurations\nused to achieve flexibility.\nThe successful use of rigid ducts for nongimballing applications in rocket engines has been\nwell established. The pump discharge ducts of the F-1 engine were large-diameter (3-in. for\nfuel and 6-in. for oxidizer), high-pressure (1600 to 1850 psi) rigid lines made of 6061-T6\n| aluminum. The lines had a long history of operation free of failures (45 engines launched,\n3179 tests, and 272 500 seconds accumulated engine time).\n|\n(\n15\n|\n' |\nike a |\n",

The ducting often is made up of many turns and elbows,\n| expansion and contraction sections, and attachment points. The centerline geometry of\nengine ducting thus represents a compromise in routing between space available and the best\nducting design practice.\nVehicle and spacecraft ducting also must compromise with practicality. Boost vehicles, for\nexample, to a great extent are cylindrical propellant tanks, and the propellant feed ducting\nmust be limited to long, straight lengths leading from the tank outlets to the engine inlets.\n| Spacecraft lines typically are small in diameter, have no flexible joints, and are circuitously\nrouted to fit the limited space available in a structure where size and weight are at a\n| premium.\n| 2.1.1.1.1 Flexible Lines\n| A flexible-element duct system may be a tension, compression, or combination |\n| tension-compression type. The type of system selected depends on a number of factors (\u00a2.g.,\nthe space available, the availability of mounting structure for anchoring, the requirement for\n| thrust-vector gimballing).\nFor a line containing flexible joints, centerline geometry is established to minimize the |\nnumber of flexible joints. Since a flexible joint (bellows) is complex, costly, and not as\nreliable as a hard line, the necessity for each flexible joint is carefully scrutinized in the\ndesign phase. System considerations that must be kept in mind during the centerline routing\nand locating of flexible joints include provisions for (1) line deflection and clearance under\nvibration, thermal contraction and expansion, and engine gimballing, (2) accessibility for\ninstallation and removal, (3) wrench clearance around bosses and fittings, (4) accessibility |\nfor in-place welding or brazing, (5) consideration for clearance if foam insulation is required\non the line, and (6) accessibility to other major components.\n| A classic configuration adhering to the minimum-number-of-joints principle, believed to\n| have originated with pump discharge ducts of the Atlas booster engines, is the wraparound\nduct arrangement for gimballing engines; this configuration, shown in figure 5, locates a flex\njoint centered on each of the two gimbal axes. This geometry was or is used for the Navaho,\n| Atlas, Thor, and Jupiter engine pump discharge ducts, the pump inlet ducts of the H-1\n| engine, and the gimballing feedlines of the Apollo Service Module engine and the descent |\nengine for the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM).

This space-frame program models the duct or line as a series of\nbeam finite elements and accounts for duct flexibility and simulated joint properties. The |\nappropriate displacements of one end of the duct with respect to the other are applied, and\nthe outputs are joint loads and deflections. Location of joints can be subjected to |\nperturbation analysis to minimize joint motions. This program became invaluable for\nlocating the joints to ensure the smallest engine-duct envelope possible.\n2.1.1.1.2 Hard Lines |\nSince flexible bellows joints are more expensive and less reliable than rigid ducting, such )\njoints are utilized only if a hard line will not satisfy the design requirements. Hard lines are\npreferred, if at all possible, in any ducting application, because they offer simplicity in\ndesign and fabrication, low cost, and high reliability; their drawbacks, which must be |\nevaluated and weighed in design-phase trade studies, are loss of interchangeability and high |\nattachment-point reactions to any applied loads. The centerline geometry of hard lines thus |\nis established to minimize the loads on attachment points.\nRecent experience indicates that some engine designers have changed their attitude toward\nline design. Ducts originally were designed to include flexible joints, but later engine models i\nwere designed with \u201chard\u201d ducts. Two such cases are the RL10 engine on the Centaur |\nupper stage and the F-1 engine on the Saturn V booster (S-IC).\nIn the early RL10 engine, braided flexible sections were used throughout the ducting; the f\npresent version is completely devoid of flexible joints. Loops and bends in the hard ducts\n| provide flexiblity.\nThe early F-1 engines incorporated bellows joints in the pump discharge ducts, but these |\nwere later replaced by aluminum hard lines with generous bends for flexibility (fig. 7); the\nlow modulus of elasticity of the aluminum permitted lower end reactions for a given\ndeflection than did a comparable duct of steel or nickel-base alloy. The change was possible\nbecause the ducts were nongimballing and were required to absorb only misalignments and |\nthermal effects. Manufacturing lead time and costs for the original bellows-joint ducts |\ndictated the change even though some interchangeability was lost. ,\n|\n2.1.1.2 DEFLECTION LIMITATION\nDifferent deflection modes (i.e., axial, angular, and shear) produce the same type of bending |\n| stresses in the bellows convolutions. If a bellows is required to deflect in all of these modes\nsimultaneously, the sum of the deflections for all modes must be kept within acceptable |\nstress limits.

Because of the inherent torsional rigidity of a typical duct, |\n| torsional deflections can be imposed only by high external loads, which must be resisted by\nthe attaching structure. Structural failure or early fatigue failure can be the result. When, |\nbecause of design constraints, torsional loading is unavoidable. the torsional effects are\nminimized by appropriate design. |\n} The duct system is routed so that torsional deflection imposed on any one joint is\nminimized.

Typical rocket-engine ducting (and most vehicle ducting) is composed of a\nseries of close-coupled, high-energy-loss components such as bends, branches, valves,\nexpansions, contractions, and flex joints. Any prediction of system energy loss based on the\ntest data for individual elements is likely to be very conservative. The reason for this\ncondition is that flow tests made to determine the pressure loss of a particular component |\nusually are run to evaluate the maximum component loss. The maximum loss is realized\n| when the installation incorporates a long straight run downstream of the test component;\nonly part of the loss chargeable to the component actually occurs within its confines, the |\n| remainder arising from flow disturbances downstream of it. Obviously, if another\ncomponent closely follows the first, part of the effect of the first is cancelled. Thus a 180\u00b0\nreturn bend causes no more than four-thirds the loss of a 90\u00b0 elbow, or slightly over twice\nthe loss of a 45\u00b0 elbow.

Wall\n| thicknesses are established through a stress analysis, in which the magnitudes of the stresses\nproduced by fluid pressure, fluid flow, thermal gradients, external forces, and acceleration |\nforces are evaluated so that the optimum thickness for reliability, fabricability, and weight\nminimization can be selected (ref.12). Methods of calculating stress levels are those\n| commonly available in strength-of-materials textbooks (e.g., refs. 13 through 15). In the\nstructural analysis, consideration must be given to the following design elements and\n| structural influences: branches, brackets, doublers, bosses, stiffeners, column buckling,\n| external collapsing pressure, and mechanical vibration (ref. 16).\n| Determination of hard-line wall thickness is particularly important because the lack of\nflexible sections requires that the line itself and its attachment points be capable of handling\n\\ any applied load. The structural analysis of hard lines is based on the maximum envelope\nresulting from tolerance stackups. The minimum wall thickness, developed from basic\nthin-shell theory, is based on maximum operating pressure at the ciitical operating\ntemperature and includes the effect of thinning in the bends. The flanges are designed to\n| develop the axial yield strength of the line at operating temperature. Maximum |\nmisalignment, thermal, and discontinuity loads are determined by use of a space-frame\nanalysis.

The strain levels of hard lines can be up |\nto twice the yield strain. Yielding during the initial installation will permit operation in the |\nelastic region for subsequent loadings. |\nIn general, on the basis of fabrication, handling, and maintainability considerations, a\nminimum wall thickness of 0.032 in. is used for hard lines 1 in. or more in diameter; lines\nless than 1 in. in diameter have wall thicknesses based on pressure requirements and are |\n| supported to keep mechanically induced vibration stresses below the material endurance ,\nlimit. |\nAll lines are proof-pressure tested.

For flow in a given Reynolds-number regime, the\n| loss coefficient for an elbow attains a minimum value and then increases as the ratio of bend\nradius to inside diameter (R/D) increases. If line routing requires small-radius elbows,\npressure drop can be minimized by selecting an optimum R/D value for the elbow;\notherwise, pressure drop can be minimized by addition of flow guide vanes (fig. 9).\nIn an elbow having a small R/D value, guide vanes provide parallel-flowing elbows of more\nnearly optimum R/D. Flow guide vanes as shown in figure 10 are utilized in sharp elbows at\nthe pump inlets for the Centaur (RL10), Thor, Atlas, and Saturn S-IC (F-1) engines; they\nhave also been used in the pump discharge ducts of the Thor and Jupiter engines.\nMinimization of pressure drop in all these applications directly enhances engine\nperformance. (References 17 and 18 are sources of design data on pressure loss for flow\nguide vanes.)

For example, the flow profile at pump, valve, and\ninjector entrances can have a great effect on the performance of these components. In\npumps having dual opposed discharge ports, the attached ducts must have equal pressure\nloss to ensure equal flow out of each port. Flow distribution has been improved with vaned\nelbows (fig. 10) and with \u201cegg-crate\u201d straighteners (fig. 11) downstream of elbows. This |\n| latter design evolved as a solution to the uneven flow distribution of LOX from the inlet\nelbow to the injector on the Atlas and Thor engines.\n| The flow splitter in the propellant feedlines of the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) descent\nengine (fig. 12) represents another flow-directing device for achieving even distribution. The |\nengine utilizes redundant shutoff valves; in normal operation, both valves open and close\nsimultaneously. However, in a partial failure mode, either of the valves can be closed.

Analysis showed that the vibration was caused by a regenerative-feedback |\ninteraction between the vehicle\u2019s propulsion and structural systems. This lengthwise\noscillation was named Pogo, after the motion of a pogo stick (ref. 27).

The combustion\n| process then generates a pulsating chamber pressure and a pulsating thrust. If this feedback\n| thrust tends to reinforce the initial perturbation, instability can occur.\nThe devices used to attenuate the flow perturbations in the Titan II feedlines (figs. 13 and\n14) are similar in operation to the surge tanks employed in the pressure regulation of large\n| pipelines that have water-hammer problems. Surge tanks have been used as\npressure-stabilizing devices in the flow lines of hydroelectric plants and pumping stations for |\nmore than 50 years; they serve as a point of pressure relief or cushion whenever there is a\nsudden change in flow. For vehicle feedlines, however, suppression in a specific frequency |\nrange is required; and this requirement necessitates a specially tuned surge system. By\nselection of the proper damping and spring characteristics, the pressure perturbations in the\nline can be absorbed by the suppression device and, in effect, uncouple the\n| engine-to-structure feedback loop.\nIn the-Titan II, an entrapped gas bubble was incorporated in the oxidizer-line standpipe to\n| provide a cushion or soft spring for the oxidizer mass in the standpipe to act on (fig. 13);\n| the energy due to pressure oscillations in the feedline can be transferred to this spring-mass |\n| system by judicious choice of the volume or height of the entrapped bubble. The fuel\nfeedlines incorporated piston-type accumulators that utilize a mechanical\nhelical-spring-and-piston arrangement to provide the desired soft spring action (fig. 14); the\nfixed mass of the spring and piston along with the mass of fuel in the accumulator provided\n| the equivalent mass required for a resonant system. The suppression devices were\nconstructed and tuned so that their frequency responses, coupled with the appropriate\nfeedline characteristics, would provide maximum attenuation of pump suction-pressure\n| oscillations that were excited by tank-structure oscillations. The combined system could be\n| optimized for maximum attenuation in a specified frequency range.\n| Pogo oscillations also occurred in the Saturn V vehicle during boost flight.

Design\ndetails of separable connectors are presented in reference 29. |\n| One of the requirements for a successful duct design is the use of connecting flanges or\nglands that are rigid enough to maintain the integrity of the static seal.

Flanges must have the surface finish, radial\n| clearances, and rigidity required by the specific seal used. Without sufficient rigidity, bolted\nflanges are particularly susceptible to rotation (fig. 16) under operational loads, and thus the f\n| effectiveness of the seal can be reduced. Inadequate bolting can cause the same effect under\n| operational conditions. In general, it is desirable to keep the bolt circle of the flanged joint |\nas close as possible to the duct diameter (i.e., to the seal) and to use many small-diameter\nbolts rather than a few large ones.

The junction of the manifold and thrust-chamber wall does not permit\nthe best structural design, and the condition is aggravated further by thermal gradients and\nengine vibrations.\n| 2.1.5.3 BRACKETS, BOSSES, AND MOUNTING LUGS\nProvisions for line mounting or support, auxiliary-equipment support, and instrumentation |\n| bosses are included in most duct assemblies. In assemblies of small lines (tubing, < 1.25 in. |\n| diam.), these provisions are accomplished in several ways. Fittings machined from bars or\n| forgings are butt welded into the tube assembly and can be utilized as brackets, mounting\n| pads, or instrumentation ports. For simplicity, and in areas of low stress, bosses or mounting |\npads can be machined to fit the tube contour and then fillet-welded to the tube assembly; in\n| all cases, consideration must be given to limiting the amount of weld dropthrough so as not\n| to interfere with the flow of fluid in the line. Flanges also can be machined to include a\n: mounting bracket or attach point, and instrumentaion bosses can be machined into the side\nof the flange.\n| In assemblies with line diameters greater than 1.25 in., mounting lugs or instrumentation\nports generally are installed on the duct wall by fusion, spot, or seam welding. Spot- and\n| seam-welded doubler-type mounting attachments have been satisfactory in low-stress,\n] low-heat-flux applications; however, structural adequacy in high-heat-flux applications has\n| not been satisfactory. In hot-gas ducts or hydrogen lines condensing liquid air on their\noutside surfaces, wall thermal gradients introduce shear stresses in welds that can cause wall\n| distortion or weld failure. Doubler-type attachments are extremely undesirable from a\ncontamination standpoint, because they can readily entrap fluids that can promote\ncorrosion. One method of eliminating this condition is to fillet weld around the periphery of\nthe doubler-type attachment.\n}\n| The most desirable method of installing mounting pads or instrumentation bosses in\n} large-diameter ducts is to machine the bracket or boss to a configuration compatible with\n| the duct contour. These detail parts then are butt welded into the assembly and inspected\nradiographically to ensure high joint efficiency. In this joint design, sharp transitions in duct\nwall thicknesses are eliminated wherever possible, and radii of machined transitions are |\n| made generous. In large-diameter, thin-wall ducts such as those used in booster vehicles, full |\nrings that match the duct diameters are butt welded into the duct assembly. These rings\n| have mounting brackets or attachment points incorporated into the machining of the ring.\nRings can also be utilized in duct assemblies in which one or more instrumentation bosses\n| are an integral part of the machined ring.\n|\n| 35 |\n!\n|\n",

In many\ninstances, bosses, fittings, and rings machined from 321-CRES bar stock leak during leak\ntests. Leakage is of the fuzz* type and is due to nonmetallic stringers in the parent material\nthat are susceptible to fracturing when subjected to any material movement such as that\nlikely to occur during welding, pressure testing, or actual operation. This leakage problem\ncan be eliminated in several ways: (1) use of vacuum-melted 321 CRES; (2) use of forgings\nrather than bar stock; (3) use of 304L instead of 321 if lower mechanical properties can be\ntolerated.\n2.1.5.4 INSULATION\nCryogenic feedlines are insulated to prevent heat transfer into the propellants for the |\nfollowing reasons: |\n@ To maintain quality (temperature and density) of the propellants entering the\nengine pumps so that engine performance is not degraded i\n@ To limit propellant boiloff during tanking and chilldown operations \u2018\n@ To limit propellant boiloff during long vehicle launch-hold periods |\n@ To prevent geysering in the ducts\n@ To prevent two-phase flow and attendant increase in pressure losses during engine |\noperation. |\nCryogenic insulation can be foam, vacuum, vacuum/powder, or vacuum/super-insulation.\nUninsulated ducts are also used in certain instances.\n|\nAlthough insulation is used extensively on vehicle propellant feedlines, the use of insulation\non the lines of the engines is limited, because (1) the lines are relatively short with little\nsurface area in comparison with long vehicle lines and (2) the mass flows are tremendous\nonce the engine firing commences, so that insulation is of little use. A cryogenic duct that is\nwarm during ground hold might well be left bare, since in space it will have the benefit of\nthe ambient vacuum. |\n| The majority of the engine ducts that are insulated have external insulation attached. The\n| pump discharge and LOX pump inlet lines of the J-2 engines had a foam-type insulation\ninstalled after the engine assembly has been completed.

The use of external insulation has little\neffect on the detail design of ducts or lines, but may influence the designer\u2019s choice of line\nrouting because of the need to allow space for the desired insulation.\n|\nOn the Saturn S-II and S-IVB stages, extensive use was made of vacuum-jacketed fuel (LH, )\nfeedlines of the initially pumped type. The lines jacketed on the Saturn-II stage were the\nfuel feedlines, the fuel recirculation lines, fuel vent lines, and the LOX feedlines. On the J-2\nengine, vacuum jackets were used on the inlet duct of the gimballed fuel pump and the\n| gas-generator fuel bleedline. Both these engine lines were in the form of concentric metal\n| bellows with a cryopumped vacuum.\n|\nThe main design considerations for the application of vacuum insulation to ducts and lines\nare as follows:\n|\n@ Choice of an initially pumped vacuum (lowest heat leak) or a cryopumped\ni vacuum\ny\n@ Proper ratio of outgassing-surface area to yacuum-chamber volume\n| @ Proper vacuum-jacket cross-sectional area to permit effective pumpdown\n| @ Jacket supports with low-heat-leak paths\n\u00a9 Cleanability |\n@ Provision for pressure-relief devices\n| \u00ae Provision for evacuation valves\n@ Provision for vacuum measurement |\n|\nThe magnitude of the allowable heat leakage will govern the choice of a cryopumped\n| vacuum or an initially pumped vacuum (lowest heat leak). Cryopumped vacuums in vacuum\njackets initially containing air at atmospheric pressure have proved satisfactory for\n| liquid-hydrogen lines when the jackets were leak tight. A pure gas condensible at operating\ntemperatures provides a better cryopumped vacuum than air, since air contains traces of\nnoncondensible gases. Some choices for liquid-hydrogen lines are carbon dioxide, nitrogen,\nand argon. With a condensible gas, attention has to be given to the effect on heat transfer\n| resutling from possible dislodgement of condensed frost by vibration, and to a method of\nensuring that the gas quality is adequate prior to cryopumping.\nI\n37\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n",
    "50": ",\nThe most significant problem with vacuum-jacketed engine lines has been controlling the |\nleakage of atmospheric air into the jackets. Until recently, the jackets have been provided\nwith burst diaphragms or relief valves to relieve internal pressure resulting from expansion of |\nair that leaked into the cryopumped vacuum. Burst disks (diaphragms of sufficiently low\nburst pressure to protect the line) have been fragile and have leaked under engine vibration.\nRelief valves have leaked and then frozen and failed to protect the line during warmup.\nBecause the safety device itself often has caused the leakage problem it was designed to\nprevent, current practice has been to seal the jacket with a plug-and-seal combination or a |\nwelded plug after a mass-spectrometer leak test has been performed on the entire jacket. |\nCurrent acceptable assembly leakage rate is 1 x 10~\u00b0 scc/sec of helium.\n|\nAn all-welded jacket construction requires that the cryopumped gas filling the jacket be\ncompatible with the closing welding process. Argon gas has been successfully used in this |\napplication to provide an inert-gas backup to the closing weld.\nIn low-heat-leak applications such as the large-surface-area propellant feedlines of booster ,\nstages, initially pumped high-vacuum insulation is used. High-vacuum insulation consists of\nan evacuated space between two highly reflecting surfaces. Heat is transferred principally by ;\n| radiation, but there may be some contribution from gas conduction.\nUtilization of vacuum insulation requires careful design and precise fabrication techniques.\nIf the vacuum space has the structural duct walls as one of its boundaries, this wall must be |\ntight enough at cryogenic temperature to prevent leakage of contained fluid into the\nevacuated space. The other boundary of the insulation space usually is exposed to ambient\ntemperature. This wall must be leaktight under all environmental conditions to which it will |\nbe exposed. Means must be provided to maintain the vacuum integrity in spite of the |\ndifferential contraction of the cold and warm boundaries.\nHelium leak-detection techniques involving the mass spectrometer are used during\nfabrication. The allowable leakage rate depends on the degree of vacuum required for |\noptimum insulation performance and the volume of the insulation space. Leakage rates of\n10-\u00b0 tol0-7 sce/sec of helium are common and are attainable with materials and welding |\ntechniques generally used.\n|\nMechanical joints such as threaded fittings or flanges are not desirable within the vacuum\nenclosure unless some provision is made to weld the joints so that they are leak tight.\n|\nIt is desirable to maintain a low ratio (< 4) of outgassing area to vacuum-annulus volume, |\nbecause this ratio directly affects the rate of vacuum decay. For example, with identical line\nlengths of annuli equally clean and at the same vacuum level, the vacuum in a line with a |\nratio of 8 will decay at a rate twice that of a vacuum in a line with a ratio of 4. The part\nwith a ratio of 8 therefore has higher maintenance costs for re-evacuation. |\n38 |\n\\ ;\n|\n| |\n",
    "51": "| The cross-sectional area of the annulus also is important in that it should be sufficiently\nlarge to permit effective vacuum pumpdown within a reasonable amount of time. Also, the\nstructure that supports the jacket shell on the mainline should not restrict molecular flow |\n| during the pumpdown period. |\n| In low-heat-leak applications, the heat-leak paths from the jacket to the inner carrier\nthrough supports and flanges must be minimized. Supports are required to maintain the |\n| outer shell of a vacuum line and to attach the ducting to the structure itself in all cases. The\nlongest possible heat path with minimum contact area is desirable. Stainless steel often is\nused when both structural strength and comparatively low thermal conductivity are desired;\nseveral nonmetallic materials (Micarta, Teflon, Kel-F) are applicable when the lower strength\nis acceptable in favor of improved thermal resistance.\n| Cleanability of the vacuum jacket surfaces is an important factor in being able to achieve\n| and maintain a high vacuum. Any material that has been exposed to air will have a layer of\ngas and vapor several molecules thick on its surface; in addition, the interior of metals\ncontains dissolved or occluded gas that is trapped during solidification. Adsorption on\n| freshly exposed surfaces is very rapid, and the adsorbed gas tends to reach an equilibrium\n; with the environmental pressure; evacuation for a long period of time will desorb the gases.\nApplication of heat during evacuation will speed the process.\n} Complete elimination of adsorbed gases is very time consuming and expensive. To attain\nhigh vacuum for long periods of time, therefore, it is necessary to make use of adsorbents |\n' and getters in the vacuum system. Adsorbents such as metallic zeolites, activated charcoal\n(not compatible with liquid oxygen), or silica gel are used to adsorb gases near liquification |\nat the temperature of the contained cryogen. For this reason, the adsorbent package is |\nlocated in a low-temperature area.\nq\nHydrogen often is an important constituent of the adsorbed gases. Because of its low boiling\npoint, it is less easily picked up by adsorbents, and therefore even avery small quantity of\nhydrogen will preclude good vacuum performance. Getter materials are used to remove this\nhydrogen. The basic difference between a getter and an adsorbent is that a getter cleans up\ngases by chemical reaction, whereas adsorbents work by surface adhesion. Getters usually\n| will produce very low pressure levels independently of temperature but the\n| chemical-reaction rate is speeded up by elevated temperatures. The practice therefore is to\nlocate the getters in the warmest portion of the insulation system. Common getter materials\n| include active metals, active zeolites, and weak oxides. While getter materials are used\nlargely with jacketed lines in facility or ground support equipment, the concept has direct\n| application in flightweight lines.\n| Provisions must be made in the duct design for mounting service valves to effect evacuation\nof the vacuum jacket. These valves usually are welded into the vacuum jacket, as is the case\nwith the S-II stage lines. Problems with Viton and Kel-F O-rings have occurred when these\n| valves were exposed to temperatures lower than -65\u00b0F.

One particularly difficult situation arises in turbine-exhaust heat\nexchangers where supply and outlet lines of the cold fluid pass through the wall of the\nhot-gas turbine-exhaust duct. Reliability of this interface is of utmost importance when the\ncold fluid is oxygen, because the leakage of oxygen into the fuel-rich turbine exhaust gases\ncan create temperatures sufficiently high to melt and burn the metal. |\n| |\n| Many designs have incorporated either tubes welded directly to edges of holes cut in the\nduct wall or tubes connected to thick flanges welded flush to the duct wall. Neither |\napproach has been satisfactory for reducing thermal stresses or providing reliable welds. A\n| design used on the J-2S engine incorporates a flanged manifold with stubouts onto which \u2019\nthe tubes are welded. The manifold in turn is welded to a somewhat flexible flared portion |\nof the hot-gas duct wall. This configuration provides a pocket of stagnant gas to protect the {\ncold manifold from high heat fluxes and thermal stresses and also provides a flexible\ninterface between hot and cold members. All weld joints are butt welded and are inspectable |\nradiographically.\n2.1.5.6 ELBOWS\nIn low-pressure systems where tube wall thickness is small with respect to tube diameter\n(tube wall less than 1/20 tube diameter), and where bend radii are small (bend radius less\nthan 4 times tube diameter), large concentrations of bending stress occur in elbows. The\nstress may be five or more times the direct bending stress.

For example, a high-pressure gaseous-hydrogen |\nenvironment is known to embrittle many metal alloys (refs. 39, 40, and 41). The degree of\nembrittlement is a function of the material temperature, environmental pressure, purity of\nthe gas, exposure time, and applied strain level. Steels (ferritic, martensitic, and bainitic),\nnickel-base alloys, and titanium alloys become embrittled in pure-hydrogen environments at\n| room temperature; the effects are more pronounced as the pressure increases. High-strength\nalloys are more susceptible than low-strength alloys. Austenitic stainless steels such as types |\n310 and 316; certain aluminum alloys such as 6061-T6, 2219-T6, and 7075-T73; pure\ncopper and beryllium copper; and the precipitation-hardened austenitic stainless steel A-286\nare only slightly affected. Inconel 718, Inconel X-750, Waspaloy, and Rene 41 are severely\nembrittled in high-pressure gaseous-hydrogen environments.\nThe degradation of mechanical properties by embrittlement generally is reflected in a loss of\nductility and fracture toughness. A large amount of experimental work currently is being\nconducted by industry and government laboratories to achieve better understanding of\nhydrogen embrittlement and its effects. This recognition and concern for\nhydrogen-environment embrittlement is part of a growing recognition of the sometimes\ndramatic and insidious effects of chemical environments on material properties and\nhardware performance. The gross effects of corrosion and the less conspicuous effects of\nstress corrosion are generally well known, and designers are alert to them. |\n| The presence of hydrogen, water vapor, and other gases can (and does) have a pronounced\neffect on crack initiation and crack growth rates.

The flow-induced vibration failure of |\nSaturn AS-502 flexible hoses in flight (ref. 64) is a case in which the lack of\nyvacuum-environment simulation during component testing was the reason that a significant\nfailure mode was not discovered prior to flight.\nThe mechanism for triggering flow-induced vibration in a bellows or hose is a function of\nthe fluid heat-transfer characteristics, momentum, and bulk modulus. No dimensionless\nparameter for correlating data from one fluid to another is known; the behavior of a bellows }\nflowing a fluid other than the end-use fluid may be entirely different from the behavior with\nthe actual fluid. For this reason, the current practice is to use actual end-use fluid for flow\ntesting. |\nThere are two general schools of thought on the number of samples to be tested in the\ninitial qualification of a new design. The NASA requirement is that a minimum of two\nsamples go through all of the planned tests in sequence, decathlon style. Industry practices\nhave sometimes been to run separate samples for each major test (vibration, flexural\nendurance, etc.), but with more time or cycles applied than required in the NASA method.\nThe samples usually would be tested to destruction after the minimum requirements had |\nbeen met, thus giving a measure of the part\u2019s margin of safety for each type of critical test.\nA discussion of test requirements and conditions is presented in reference 16.\nThe effect of environmental temperature on fatigue life of metals (in standard coupon |\nshapes) is well known. In general, fatigue life is reduced at elevated temperatures and\nincreased at cryogenic temperatures. For example, the life of 321-CRES bellows at\nliquid-nitrogen temperature (\u2014320\u00b0F) is 4 to 5 times greater than that at room temperature\nfor a given strain level; at liquid-hydrogen temperature (\u2014423\u00b0F), life is 10 to 100 times\ngreater. However, very little fatigue testing at high or low temperatures actually has been\n| performed on bellows for design-evaluation or production-comparision tests. Usually,\n| acceptability is based on results of a room-temperature test that gives little more than an |\nindication of actual life at operating temperatures. For example, for a Hastelloy-C bellows\non a J-2S heat exchanger, the fatigue life at 800\u00b0F, under the same deflections, was\napproximately one-third the life at room temperature. Testing at operational temperatures\nduring initial qualification tests provides a good basis for assurance that the later\nquality-control sampling tests at room temperature are adequate.\n| For bellows intended for aerospace application, manufacturing procedures normally require\nproof- and leak-test certification of every piece in a production lot. Proof testing is primarily\na structural integrity test. Water rather than gas commonly is used as the test medium\nbecause, in case of a burst, much less energy is released from water. Distilled or deionized |\nwater is employed, because tap water can deposit chlorides on the bellows surface and\npromote cell corrosion or intergranular corrosion within a very short time (refs. 65 and 66). |\nFor bellows or ducts that operate at elevated temperature, it is common practice to perform\n\u2019 50\nj\n| |\n",

The proof |\n| pressure simply is multiplied by the largest ratio of the room-temperature value to |\nelevated-temperature value for yield stress, ultimate stress, or elastic modulus; this pressure\nthen is used as the test pressure.\nThe mass spectrometer is a generally accepted device for verifying bellows leak tightness. |\nThe mass-spectrometer leak detector (MSLD) is capable of detecting leakage rates (i.e., has a\n| leak sensitivity) of about 10? scc of helium/sec. The MSLD test is preferred for accuracy ,\nover the test with gas-pressurized bellows submerged in water, because the surface tension of\nthe water is capable of sealing minute pinholes or cracks in the bellows wall, and at small\n| leakage rates the water can dissolve a leak bubble as it is formed; leak sensitivity with\n| bubbles is 10-? scc/sec. Soap or detergent leak-detection fluids have been found to cause |\nstress corrosion of bellows materials; however, a neutral aqueous solution of surfactants (per\n| ref. 67) has been used safely and has a sensitivity of 10~* scc/sec. |\n| The end-use configuration is simulated as closely as possible in test setups so that all |\nconditions to which assemblies will be subjected can be evaluated. For example, both the |\nJ-2 and F-1 engines have numerous fluid-carrying lines that must cross the interface between\n| engine and vehicle. The lines are flexible to accommodate gimballing motion. On the J-2 |\nengine, all the lines are flexible hoses and are clamped together to assist in maintaining their\nrelative positions. This clamping affects the distribution of the line assembly deflection |\n| among the individual flexible-hose sections in the line and adds to their overall stiffness. On\nthe F-1 engine, the flexible hoses cross the gimbal plane and are attached to nongimballing\n| flexible hoses on the engine; this configuration influences their deflection. Good practice, |\n| then, is to test all lines clamped together as a bundle. |\nAcceptance tests are performed for quality assurance on all welded components. |\nCircumferential weld dropthrough can cause an increase in pressure drop of hose assemblies\nthat is sufficient to affect engine performance. Small-diameter (< 1.25 in.) lines are\nespecially sensitive and are checked during acceptance by passing a ball gage completely\nthrough the assembly.\n| Testing of aerospace ducting involves extremes of temperature, large pressure forces,\nhigh-pressure gas generation from cryogenic fluids, combustibility, and toxicity;\n| considerable caution therefore is exercised in the design and operation of test programs.\n| References 16 (p. 30) and 68 present details on test programs.\n| 2.1.7.2 TEST INSTRUMENTATION\n| Typical parameters measured on lines, bellows, and flexible hoses during development and\n| qualification testing include static and total pressure, temperature, flowrate, strain, and\n|\n51\n| |\n",

Methods evaluated involved microphones, radiography, strain gages, and miniature\naccelerometers. The accelerometers proved most effective for braided flexible hoses,\nwhereas strain gages, mounted on the crowns of bellows convolutions, were most effective\nfor bellows. The attrition rate on gages during flow tests is high (up to 50%), especially\nunder cryogenic conditions. Strain gages have been used on bellows inside wire-braided\nflexible hoses, but installation of gages requires great care, whether they are installed before |\nthe braid is assembled to the hose or afterwards, when the braid wires must be compressed |\nlocally to form a window for the innercore; the braid window is retained by local soldering |\nto permit access for affixing strain gages to the convolution.\nVibration frequencies of bellows, particularly those of pendulum mode in braided hoses, can \\\nbe as high as 60 kHz under cryogenic conditions. Frequencies of this magnitude normally\nare filtered out in the measuring circuit of the standard, high-frequency,\nrocket-engine-vibration instrumentation.

The bellows must be designed such that the stresses incurred are kept\nbelow the endurance limit of the material (i.e., no reduction in fatigue life is caused by\n| vibration).\n| Methods for predicting flow-induced vibration inputs are presented in references 83 through\n90; these techniques utilized in bellows design can enable the designer to develop a bellows\ncompletely free from vibration or at least free from unacceptable levels of vibration.\nPrediction of mechanical vibration inputs is more difficult because of the dynamic\ncomplexity of the structure to which the flexible duct is attached. One method is to\nextrapolate known vibration inputs from similar installations on other engines and compare\nthem with calculable mechanical resonant frequencies of the duct design; a more accurate\nbut costlier method is to build prototype hardware and test it on development engines while\nthe vibration environment is measured. If a bellows operates in a vibration environment\ncontaining excitation frequencies matching any of the natural structural frequencies of the\nbellows, its fatigue life can be exceeded within a short operational time period. The most\nfrequent bellows failure mode is the development of a fatigue crack that permits leakage\nthrough the convolution. The cracks usually are circumferentially located in the crowns or\nroots of the convolutions, since these are the areas of maximum bending stress. Analysis of\npast fatigue failures indicates they have been caused by flow-induced vibration (sec.\n2.2.1.2.2), mechanical vibration (sec. 2.2.1.2.3), or a combination of the two (sometimes\naggravated by overdeflection handling abuse). Successful bellows are those designed with\nadequate fatigue margins that allow for all of these influences.\n2.2.1.2.1 Vibration Susceptibility\nStructural integrity must be maintained during and after the operational periods when many\ntypes of dynamic loads may be applied to a bellows.

In bellows, an internal flow\nliner (sec. 2.2.4) has always resolved the problem by preventing impingement of the flow\nstream on the convolutions; however, the installation of the liner usually presents\ncomplications in design and fabrication and makes the bellows more difficult to clean. The\nliners themselves have failed, apparently as a result of vibration. Flow liners appear to be the |\nbest \u201cquick fix\u2019\u201d\u2019 or empirical solution to flow-induced vibration, but not necessarily the best\nsolution.

The Saturn AS-502 failure\ninvestigation culminated in an analytical method (ref. 90) for determining whether a flexible ,\n| line is susceptible to flow-induced vibration. The analysis evolved from the results of a test\nprogram utilizing more than 50 different flexible line and duct specimens (refs. 64 and 98). |\n| The analysis determines the dynamic response and fluid excitation required to cause fatigue\nfailures associated with the individual-convolution vibration mode. The essential dynamic\nconsideration is that the response characteristics for the individual-convolution mode are the\nresult of coupling of the structural dynamics of the conyolutions and the dynamics of the\nfluid within the convolutions. The excitation due to fluid flow within the flexible line is |\ndescribed as being capable of exciting a band of response frequencies where the boundaries\nof the excitation frequencies are proportional to velocity. The low-frequency excitations\ngenerally are associated with vortex shedding within the turbulent boundary layer. The |\nhigh-frequency (and potentially much stronger) excitation is associated with a convection\nfrequency in the turbulent boundary layer. The convection frequency is defined as the\ncharacteristic frequency associated with the fluid velocity past equally spaced wall\nirregularities (the convolutions). |\n| Acoustic loading can increase the number of degrees of freedom of a bellows system by\ncoupling the bellows to the acoustic modes. When this type of coupling occurs, very\nsignificant pressure fluctuations can be propagated throughout the fluid system. These\nacoustic resonances, in addition to producing noise, cause a significant increase in the\nflow-induced stress levels. This effect apparently is the result of the acoustic-resonance flow\n| and pressure fluctuations coupling with the vortex shedding process to produce a force\namplification. This phenomenon is discussed in detail in references 85 through 89.\n| If a resonance can exist, the analysis provides a technique for estimating the energy levels |\nassociated with the resonance; the energy available can then be translated to a stress level in\n| the part. When the expected stress level is known, a quantitative evaluation then can be |\nmade to determine if the stress level exceeds the alternating stress that the part is capable of\nwithstanding without high-cycle fatigue failure.\nThe detailed analytical methods for determining flow-induced vibration excitation and |\nresponse dynamics are presented in reference 90. Useful response information also appears\nin references 91 through 94. These analytical methods provide for determining, with a high |\nconfidence level, the flow-induced vibration susceptibility of a given flexible-line design for\na given set of operating conditions while still in the design phase; these techniques thus\neliminate the need for expensive cut-and-try flow testing of prototype hardware. |\nBefore the sudden surge in activity on flow-induced vibration of bellows brought about by\nthe failure of flexible lines on the Saturn AS-502 vehicle, it was commonly believed that the |\n|\n|\n",

The dynamics technology after the Saturn AS-502\n\nflexible-line failures proved this conclusively. The multi-ply does provide some damping over\nthe single ply (refs. 84 through 88), but if the natural structural frequency of the |\n\nconvolution shape involved coincides with exciting frequencies, failure is likely to occur.\n\n|\n2.2.1.2.3_ Mechanically Induced Vibration\nThe vibration-response characteristics for a given mechanical excitation input are calculated |\n| in the same manner as those for flow-induced vibration.

In this case, bellows are deliberately designed to keep |\nnatural-response frequencies from matching excitation frequencies.\n|\n; |\nDouble-bellows-spoolpiece arrangements (fig. 22) with an undamped or unsupported span |\n\nare susceptible to vibration of the long unsupported mass from both flow-induced and\n| mechanical excitation.\n\nBELLOWS SPOOL PIECE\n| Pas a a oN |\nra |\nFLANGE\n= ei \u2014\nEN (aia\n| i |\nTENS ION-TIE LINKAGE \u2014~ Possible vibration direction\ni\nFigure 22. \u2014 Example of double-bellows-spoolpiece configuration susceptible to vibration.\n\n|\n|\n| 60 j\n| |\n| |\n| |\n",

It is readily available, has\n\ngood forming properties, and has high ultimate strength in comparison with yield strength.\n\nHowever, it has been demonstrated repeatedly in the Atlas, Thor, and Saturn engine\nprograms that while the material is, as its name implies, corrosion resistant, it is not\ncorrosion proof. Most of the classical corrosion modes such as stress corrosion, pitting |\n\n| corrosion, and intergranular corrosion have occurred (ref. 103).\n\n| The high percentage of iron in 321 CRES makes it susceptible to corrosion. Bellows have |\n\n| residual stresses as a result of cold working; being thin walled, bellows thus are particularly |\n\n|\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n",

Chlorides, deposited on the\nbellows surface by everything from contaminated water to perspiration from a sweaty palm, |\ntypically have been the corrosion promoters. Chlorides used in cleaning agents can be |\nentrapped in geometric crevices such as close-pitch convolutions. Cryogenic fluids cause\nmoisture to condense and freeze on the outside surfaces of engine ducting and then act as an\nelectrolyte with chlorides or other contamination deposits to promote corrosion. This\nproblem is dealt with on existing hardware in service by periodic leak checks and\ninspections, with replacement of unfit hardware, and by continuous efforts to maintain a |\nmoisture-free controlled environment. |\nThe storable (noncryogenic) propellants used in the Titan Il, Apollo Command Module, and\nLEM ascent and descent stages do not create copious amounts of condensate, and the\nhardware has not been subject to corrosion. Many storable propellants, however, are very |\n| corrosive, and selection of compatible materials for service in contact with these fluids is an |\nimportant design problem (refs. 42 through 45).\n|\n| 2.2.1.5 MANUFACTURING |\nThe main problems in the manufacture of formed, straight-side-wall, convoluted bellows |\n| have involved material thinning, proper heat-treatment control, proper welding, and\nconvolution stackoff. |\n| Thinning of the convolution crowns during the forming process is a common occurrence |\nwith roll-formed bellows. With this type of forming process, thinning 10 percent below the '\n| nominal wall thickness is attained. Hydraulic forming processes have less trouble with\nthinning, and thinning 5 percent below nominal wall thickness is attainable. The\nconsequence of thinning is that more deflection takes place in the thinned section because\n| stiffness is reduced, and therefore high stresses and early fatigue failure can occur. Thinning\ncan be controlled by dimensionally examining sample pieces in a production run and by\n| subsequently adjusting initial tube thickness, tooling, or production techniques if variation\nfrom the norm appears.\n|\n| Proper control of heat treatment requires constant quality-assurance surveillance, because (1) |\n| bellows performance is degraded by improper heat treatment and (2) bellows usually are |\nheat treated in lots; improper heat treatment can then be costly in requiring reprocessing or\nreplacing the entire lot. One typical problem has involved maintaining the proper |\natmosphere in the furnace or retort during the heating process. Circulation of the\n| atmosphere must be maintained to ensure coverage of all bellows surfaces; the spaces\nbetween convolutions are particularly restrictive to good flow coverage. Result of improper |\nheat treatment can be lower-than-design strength and possible pressure or fatigue failures.\n| Surface effects such as oxidation and \u201corange peel\u201d also can take place and reduce fatigue\nlife because of the notch stress raisers created.\n|\n| 62 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}\n",

In this |\nrespect, the rapid increase in lateral stiffness as this ratio becomes smaller contributes to the\nsignificance of stackoff.\n; |\n2.2.1.5.1 Interply Lubricants\nThe tubes forming the multi-ply construction are slipped together concentrically during\nfabrication of the bellows; a very tight fit is required and sometimes a lubricant is used.\nBecause of the tight fit, it is difficult to remove the lubricant after the tubes are engaged.\nThus, the lubricant must be chemically compatible with the service fluid, particularly with\nLOX if the part is to be used in LOX service; it must also be nonvolatile at operating |\ntemperatures to prevent interply pressurization. |\nFailures have occurred in multi-ply bellows used in LOX and in high-temperature ducts |\nwhen contaminants trapped between the plies vaporized during operation (or reacted\nviolently when they came in contact with LOX that entered through a crack) and caused\nsufficient pressure to burst the bellows (ref. 104). The word \u201cimplosion\u201d is used to describe\nthe failure mode, because the rapid pressure buildup causes the inner ply to burst into the\nflow stream.\nSolid dry-film lubricant (e.g., molybdenum disulfide) has been utilized successfuly as an |\nassembly aid; since it is a solid, it creates no volume-expansion problem when heated. |\nA successful method for removing lubricant or moisture is to bake the bellows after forming\nand before the plies at each end of the assembly are circumferentially welded together. If a\nparticular bellows-forming process necessitates welding the tubes circumferentially prior to\nforming to prevent ply slippage, vent holes are located adjacent to the weld in each of the\nplies; the vent holes permit outflow of trapped vapors during the baking process after\nforming. A second circumferential weld is then made inboard of the vent holes, and the |\nbellows neck is trimmed to eliminate the hole areas. This procedure prevents contamination\nfrom enterring between the laminations once the part is in service.\nBecause of the failures that have resulted from interply lubricants, the practice of using\nlubricants has been largely discarded by bellows suppliers. The ply tubes are nested |\nconcentrically without lubricant, and the additional clearance required between tubes is\ntaken up by hydraulic sizing prior to forming the convolutions.\n64 '\n| \u2018 a |\n",
    "77": "| 2.2.1.5.2 Weld Necks\n| The success or failure of a bellows joint often depends on the detail design involved in the\n| integration of the bellows-to-duct interface. In preferred configurations, the weld neck inner\ndiameter (ID) is equal to the bellows ID. Since the bellows wall thickness is always less than\nthat of the adjoining duct, the transition piece must provide the proper thickness ratio for a\n| sound weld joint. Doublers are often used to build up weld-neck thickness for a more\nfavorable ratio of bellows-to-duct weld thickness. However, if a doubler is permitted to\ntouch the end convolution, the stress raiser thus created can promote early fatigue failure\nwhen the bellows is deflected or subjected to vibration. Also, the weld attachment is kept\naway from the end convolution, because (1) the flexural stress at the convolute root\ndissipates rapidly with distance from the convolute and (2) short necks make welding\n| difficult.\n|\n| The spring-rate loads of the bellows transmitted to the duct at the weld neck are factors in\n| neck design. Failure of the weld joint or the neck can occur if the stress applied at the\nbellows-to-duct interface exceeds the design strength.\nAlthough the geometry of the outside-neck attachment may have appeal, designs that\nrequire this configuration are evaluated carefully, because fabrication is difficult. The\n| outside-neck attachment always increases cost of manufacture and may downgrade the\nbellows performance, as certain convolute configurations may be inhibited.\n2.2.2 Bellows Restraint |\n|\n| 2.2.2.1 MECHANICAL LINKAGES\nThe most commonly used restraint design is the gimbal-ring joint (or universal); other |\nconcepts include the hinged joint, ball joint, and braided sheath. Reference 16 (pp. 76-78)\npresents a broad spectrum of designs.\nThe gimbal-ring joint is the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of bellows restraints. It can be designed to ,\n| withstand extremely high pressures and temperatures, is capable of angular deflection in all |\nplanes, and will withstand imposed torsional loads. Stops to prevent excessive bellows\nangulation are readily adaptable to this design. The load-carrying pivot pins may be designed\n| for either single or double-shear support, the choice depending on the separating load. The |\nsame comments apply to the hinged joint, which provides angulation in one plane only. |\nA subtlety of gimballed bellows, sometimes overlooked even by experienced duct designers,\nis the fact that a gimbal (or universal) joint, when deflected about both of its axes\nsimultaneously, produces a torsional deflection (refs. 105 and 106). Motion is not\n65\n{|S wi \u201c ia |\n",
    "78": ";\ntransmitted with a constant angular-velocity ratio unless the intersection of driving and\ndriven components lies in a homokinetic plane (ref. 105). Gimbal-ring linkages do not have\nthis type of geometry; therefore, they induce a torsional deflection. Because the bellows\nnormally is very rigid in torsion, high torsional stresses are produced.\n\nOne of the most popular and inexpensive methods for an external, tension-tie restraint is the\nuse of a braided wire sheath, as in the case of a flexible hose. This type of joint can absorb |\nboth angular and shear deflections, and acts as a vibration damper for the bellows inside.\n\n| The braid restricts angular deflection under high pressure by offcenter pivoting, which\nresults in increased bending moments.\n\nFriction between the braid and bellows can be minimized by an adapter, which provides |\n| clearance at the end convolutions, and by the application of solid dry-film lubricant on the\n\nouter surface of the bellows and inner surface of the braid. Excessive friction and eventually |\n\npossible galling of the journal-type pin bearings on the linkages is a problem that also can be\n\nalleviated with solid dry-film lubricants (refs. 107 and 108). LOX-compatible lubricants\n\nmust be used between bellows plies and on the bearings of restraint linkages utilized in LOX\n\nsystems. Data on LOX compatibility of lubricants are utilized in making a selection; if data |\n\nare not available, as on a new product, LOX impact tests are performed. Reference 107\n\nprovides additional information on the use of lubricants for linkage bearings.\n\n| Once a gimbal-ring type of bellows restraint has been selected, the question of internal\nversus external mounting (fig. 24) must be resolved. In general, the selection of internal or\nexternal gimbal is left to the discretion of the designer after design tradeoff studies for his\nparticular application have been made. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages. The\ninternal gimbal is more difficult to clean, because all of the mechanisms comes in contact\n\n| with the flowing fluid and therefore requires cleaning. Both gimbals can be \u201c\u2018sleeved\u201d\u2019 to\nreduce flow losses; however, the conventional internal-gimbal-ring design has a higher loss\ncoefficient than the external-ring, sleeved-bellows design.\n\nIf the diameter of an internal gimbal ring is equal to or greater than the duct inside\ndiameter, a larger diameter bellows is required to encompass the linkage. The larger bellows |\ncauses a greater separating load and consequently an increase in linkage weight to carry this\nload. A comparision of the weights of internal and external gimbal designs for a given |\ndiameter and pressure cannot be generalized and must be evaluated for each individual\ndesign case. |\nThe external-ring design affords some handling damage protection to the bellows, whereas\n\n| the internal ring design leaves the bellows exposed. Double versus single shear in the clevis |\npin of the gimbal linkage is a function of the load that the joint can carry, and either type is\nadaptable to both the internal and external gimbals.

To solve the overdeflection problem, the gimbals were redesigned so that the ring\nwould bottom out on the rigid tube structure of the duct instead of on the bellows.\n| The internal-tie link joint is an economical version of the gimbal joint for small or medium\n| pressure-separating loads, and weighs less than the equivalent gimbal.

This terminology is misleading, however; no pressure compensation is |\nperformed by the duct. A more nearly correct description is \u201cthrust compensating,\u201d because |\nit is the axial thrust caused by the pressure separating force that is balanced by the\ncompensating bellows. It is axiomatic that, in order to compensate for thrust, the volume\nmust also be compensated; so this portion of the PVC description is correct. The primary\nuse of the compensating joint is to retain a tension-type system in areas where limited space }\nexists and axial travel cannot be absorbed by angulation. By proper selection of the\n| cross-sectional area of the balance bellows, the thrust force may be undercompensated, fully\ncompensated, or overcompensated, so that a compressive, balancing, or tensile load is\nimposed on the installation restraints.\nThe large (+ 50%) volumetric changes incurred in straight-run gimballing ducts\ncorrespondingly incur pressure perturbations that could be detrimental to engine operation. |\nThe thrust-compensating design eliminates these pressure variations.

Consistent engine performance depends on uniform\nsupply of propellants to the pumps. The PVC design maintains a constant system volume |\n| under all engine gimballing conditions. |\nIn the F-1 pump inlet duct, a bellows external to and concentric with the main line bellows !\noffsets the separating force of the main bellows (fig. 31, a schematic of the joint shown in\nfig. 30).

Telescoping flow\nsleeves can also be provided. This design permits wide-open flow area throughout its length\n| and thereby adds very little additional pressure loss over a straight hard line.\nThe thrust-compensating design shown in figure 32 utilizes axial bellows of the same\ncross-sectional area; operating pressure is applied to the outside surfaces of both bellows.\nThe internal volume of the bellows second from the left in the figure is vented to\n) atmosphere.

The chamber is\nvented to internal duct pressure and, since the annular area AA is equal to the main duct |\nbellows area A,, an axial force equal and opposite to the pressure-separating force of the\nmain duct bellows is created. The entire joint is prevented from separating axially by the\noverlapping fingers alternately tying across the joint from each free end. Sufficient clearance\n| is provided between fingers to permit the required axial and angular motion. This design\n| provides compactness, because the bellows overlap concentrically and in addition are not\nlimited to axial stroke alone.\nThe design in figure 33 was used in the pump-discharge ducts of the early J-2 engines. In\n| later engines, the design was changed to the external-tie-bar design shown in figure 34, not\nbecause of performance problems but because of lower cost.

Increasing the wall thickness, which thereby increased the rigidity of the liner\nuntil it successfully withstood the vibration inputs, solved this problem. ,\nCollapse of liners as a result of pressure on the outer diameter of the liner exceeding that on\nthe inner diameter also has occurred (ref. 111). Collapse has been attributed to sudden\nchanges in flowrate that cause a differential static pressure across the liner wall. Since liner\ndiameter usually is smaller than the attaching duct diameter (fig. 40), the liner section |\nbehaves like a venturi, and rapid changes in flowrate cause static pressure changes in the |\nliner section. If the static pressures on either side of the liner do not stabilize quickly, a |\nmomentary differential can be induced on the liner wall and cause collapse. In the case of\nfill and drain lines, the stagnation pressure in the drain flow direction (against the OD of the |\nliner) adds to the difference in static pressures and can cause liner collapse (ref. 111). Vent |\nholes in the liner can relieve some of this pressure differential, or the liner can be |\nstrengthened to withstand the applied load. |\n2.3 FLEXIBLE HOSE |\nThe industrial experience in braided flexible hose provided a starting point for advancing the |\ntechnology to the state required for space-vehicle applications.

This pressure\n| level was greatly in excess of the commercial rating and left little or no margin of safety.\nThese hoses, however, were used for initial engine tests, and pressure ratings eventually were\n| increased by modifying the design to meet aerospace requirements. Thousands of hoses in |\nthis size (3 to 3% in.) have been used for both cryogenic-oxidizer and hydrocarbon-fuel\napplications in the Navaho, Atlas, Jupiter, and Thor engines, a very large population for\nspace-vehicle hardware.\nLittle was known about the pressure losses in hoses at the Reynolds number used in rocket\n| engine operation (Re > 10\u00b0). Fatigue life and cryogenic-temperature properties of the\nmaterials available were sketchy. These voids eventually were filled to permit successful\noperational designs.\nCoiled tubing, an alternate design for small-diameter bellows-type flexible hoses, is not used\non any engines of the Saturn or earlier programs. However, rocket engine manufacturers do\nuse coiled tubing consistently in tank-pressurization heat exchangers.

It also will swell when\n| subjected to trichloroethylene flushing; the swelling restricts flow and can cause failure of |\nthe end-fitting joint.\ni 2.3.3.2 BENDING MOMENT\nThe bending moment required to bend a flexible hose is a consideration because of the ,\nloading applied to adjacent components. For example, reduction of bending moments of\nflexible hoses that cross the engine gimbal plane reduces the actuator loading required to |\ngimbal the engine. Lubricants applied to braid wires and the outer surfaces of the innercore\nreduce bending moments. Compressing the innercore axially before installing the braid\nresults in more convolutions per inch and a lower bending stiffness, at the expense of |\nincreased weight and material cost. Innercore compression also improves the ability of the\nhose to withstand pressure impulses.\n|\n2.3.3.3 BUCKLING STABILITY\n|\nBuckling stability, which is of concern in the design of a bellows, is not a source of concern\n| in the design of a flexible hose. The support that the braid provides for the innercore\nprevents buckling unless end attachments (on installation) prevent the braid from pulling\n| taut when the hose is pressurized.\n87\n| |\n| |\n|\n|\n|\n| a sete\n",
    "100": "|\n2.3.4 Braid\nThe braid consists of a woven tubular covering that restrains the innercore against\nelongation while giving it lateral support and protection. Since the braid absorbs the entire |\nseparating load, its strength largely governs the burst pressure* of a hose; stiffness and yield\nstrength govern the length or stretch. The braid covering on the majority of hoses used in\n| rocket propulsion systems is woven of stainless-steel wire. Tubular braid may be woven\ndirectly on the innercore. For bellows-type innercores, however, the braid generally is\nwoven in continuous lengths or sheaths that are cut as required and slipped over the bellows |\n| during assembly. Sections of braid are cut at a length slightly greater than that of the\nconvoluted innercore. A tensile load then is applied to the ends of the braid section, and the\n| section is attached to the end fittings by brazing or welding.\nThe braid-weave pattern must be such that the wires will not bind or bottom out within the |\nangular-deflection design limits of a particular flexible section. If the wires within a braid\nbottom out against each other when the hose is angulated, further deflection will be\n| distributed over a shorter live-length section, the result being higher stresses and shorter\nfatigue life.\nTubular wire braid is available in a variety of constructions. In addition to variations in\nnumbers and diameters of wires, there are variations in the form or grouping of the wires,\nthe weave, the braid angle, and the number of braid layers. The most commonly used form\nof wire is the \u201cbeamed\u201d type in which each carrier bobbin of the braiding machine is wound |\nwith a group of parallel wires called a \u201cpick,\u201d or an \u201cend,\u201d or a \u201ccarrier.\u201d In another type,\neach pick consists of a number of wires that have been first braided into a flat braid before\nbeing wound on the bobbin. The size and number of wires per carrier are selected to obtain |\nflexibility and strength within the machine capabilities. |\nTwo weaves are commonly used: plain weave, two-over/two-under; and diamond weave,\n| one-over/one-under. The term \u201cbasket weave\u201d is loosely applied to any tubular braid. Plain |\nweave permits the greater number of wires and therefore the greater coverage. (Coverage is .\ncritical in electrical shielding applications, but is of secondary importance in metal hose as\n| long as the mesh remains tight enough to retain the innercore.) Large braids are limited to |\nplain weave. Diamond weave is the tighter construction. The cost of either weave is about |\nthe same. Typical braid configurations are shown in figure 43. )\n| The braid angle or helix angle is the angle whose tangent is the pitch divided by the braid\ncircumferential length per pitch, the pitch being the axial distance taken by any given wire |\n| to make one complete turn. An angle of approximately 45\u00b0 is presumed to give maximum\nflexibility consistent with good end strength and burst resistance for hose with metal\n| innercore.\n| \u201cMaximum pressure the hose can retain without losing pressure or fluid. |\n|\n88 |\n|\n! |\n}\n| |\n",

The filter element can be either a\nsurface or a depth type. A surface filter performs its function by trapping particulate\ncontamination on the upstream side of the filter surface at the inlets of the filter material |\ncapillaries. A depth filter performs its function by trapping particulate contamination within\nthe intricate capillary system of the filter material; it has the ability to remove particles with |\none dimension significantly greater than either of the other two dimensions (e.g., fibers).\nThe significance of longest or largest dimension for the particle as compared with the\ndiameter of a spherical particle is emphasized in reference 131.

Several |\n| |\n96 |\n|\n|\n",
    "109": ": different ratings are used in the filter industry; some tend to be misleading if not fully\nunderstood by the user. The most definitive of the various ratings is the maximum particle\nsize rating (MPR), which controls the maximum (longest) dimension of any particulate\ncontaminant allowed downstream of a filter. Other filter ratings commonly used are\n\u201cabsolute\u201d and \u201cnominal\u201d. The absolute rating applied to a filter unit requires the unit to\nretain all spherical particles equal to or greater in size than the absolute rating. This rating\ncontrols only the second largest dimension of contaminant allowed downstream of the\n| filter. The absolute rating is often referred to as the glass bead rating (GBR). The nominal\nrating applied to a filter unit requires that the unit retain a certain percentage (by count or\n| by weight) of spherical particles or graded dust equal to or greater in size than the nominal\nrating. The nominal rating is always less than the absolute rating. The nominal rating is less\nwell defined than absolute rating, and it is a relative indication of filter capability only. The\nuse of nominal rating in the filter industry is becoming obsolete because of the ambiguity of |\n| its definition. |\n| The maximum particle size rating can be determined by test. The test involves the use of a |\n| readily identifiable contaminant that contains particles of various sizes and shapes. A test\n| procedure for determining maximum particle size is described in reference 132.\n| The absolute rating (GBR) of a filter also can be determined by test. Tests are based on |\n| filtration of an artificial contaminant (glass beads) under specified test conditions. Effluent\ncontaining artificial contaminant that has passed through the test filter is collected. The\n| artificial contaminant is passed through a membrane filter and the particles held on the\n| membrane are scanned for the largest particle (ref. 133). Since approximately 60 percent of\nthe beads required for testing a 15-u filter fall in the 25-u range or smaller, they tend to\n| coagulate on the membrane and obscure beads that are larger. The test procedure most\n| often utilized is well defined in reference 133, but provisions for preventing coagulation are\n| lacking.\nA means of determining nominal (average) pore size is the mercury intrusion method, which\nis not in general use because of the toxicity of the mercury and is applicable only to filter\ncloth in the flat state. A detailed explanation of the mercury intrusion test is presented in\n| reference 12 (sec. 15.8.5.2).\nAlthough the use of absolute rating (GBR) is more prevalent, the maximum particle size\nrating (MPR) is a truer indication of the protection afforded to downstream components. A\ncorrelation between MPR and GBR has been established for both twilled double Dutch\nweave (TDDW) and plain Dutch single weave (PDSW) wire cloth (ref. 132), viz., the\nmaximum particle size rating (MPR) is approximately 2.5 times the absolute (GBR) rating.\nAs an example, a filter element using TDDW wire cloth having an absolute rating of 10p will\n| permit the passage of particles up to 25u into the downstream system. The correlation\nbetween MPR and GBR for other types of filter elements (e.g., etched disk) needs to be\n| established by test for each particular type. Reference 132 lists the correlation factors for a\nlimited number of filter materials and kinds of construction.\na7\n|\n|\n|\n",
    "110": "Maximum-particle-size tests are not practical for acceptance testing of production filters. |\nThe glass bead test is a destructive type of test and is never used as an acceptance test;\nhowever, correlation with a nondestructive bubble-point test permits verification of absolute\nrating for production filters. The bubble-point test consists of wetting the filter with a liquid\nof known surface tension and then determining the gas pressure required to force a bubble\nthrough the wetted pores. The larger the pore, the lower the pressure at which a bubble or\nstream of bubbles will form. The detailed procedure is described in reference 134.\n2.4.1.2 SYSTEM CONTAMINATION/FILTER AREA\nThe primary function of a filter is to prevent damage to contamination-sensitive\ncomponents in the fluid system. To ensure reliable performance of a system, it is necessary\nto reduce the contaminants that are entrained in the operating fluid to a level at which the |\nremaining particulate matter will not cause damage to the critical operating components. |\nThe determination of how much filter area is needed is based on accurate prediction of the\namount of system contamination that can be expected for any given application. Several\ncompanies and universities have been working on the problem of accurately predicting\nsystem contamination, but as yet no real solution is in sight. There appears to be no\ncorrelation between the actual and predicted amounts, sizes, and types of contaminants; the\nreason may be the variation in techniques utilized in manufacturing and building systems\nand components. A detailed description of some of the problems encountered may be found\nin references 135 through 138.\nThe lack of a realistic basis for determining the amount or makeup of contaminant that is\nlikely to pass through a filter during its service life has led to some arbitrary compromises. |\nIn order to demonstrate that sufficient filter area has been provided for a particular design, a |\nspecified amount of contaminant is required to be retained by the filter without exceeding\nsome maximum differential pressure (contaminant tolerance). The most frequently used test\ncontaminants are AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts.* The two dusts may not ideally represent\nthe true makeup of system contamination, but they do provide a baseline material for\nevaluating the ability of a filter to retain particles presented to the upstream side under flow\nconditions. The amount of dust to be presented to the filter is also an arbitrary compromise. |\nReference 132 provides an excellent source of information on tests that were performed to |\ndetermine the contaminant tolerance of various filter materials for both gaseous and liquid ,\nflow.\nA good example of a filter problem related to unpredictable system contamination occurred\non the SSME. The main pneumatic filter had satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to retain\na specified amount of AC-Coarse dust without creating excessive differential pressure. When\nengine testing began, several filter failures were caused by the sudden accumulation of fine\ncontaminants (smaller than the absolute rating (GBR) of the filter) that plugged the pores\n| *These test dusts are Natural Arizona Dust supplied by General Motors Phoenix Laboratory and classified to specific |\nparticle-size distributions by the AC Spark Plug Division of General Motors Corporation.\n98 |\n|\n|\n|\n",

The source of the contaminants was the test\nfacility plumbing. To resolve the problem, the quality of filtration in the test facility was\nmade better than the quality of filtration called for in the engine system.\n2.4.1.3 RESIDUAL FILTER CONTAMINATION |\n| Residual contamination is the amount of contaminant remaining in the filter after final\ncleaning that can potentially slough off and pass into the downstream system. Contaminant\n| particles are accumulated by filters during the various stages of manufacturing. A last-stage |\ncleaning of the filter removes some percentage of the particles, the amount depending on\n| how rigorous the cleaning process is. To facilitate final cleaning, it is desirable therefore to |\n| limit the amount of contaminants accumulated by the filter during manufacture. Cleaning\nprocesses are expensive, and when a filter has accumulated a great deal of contaminant the\n| cost of final cleaning can often exceed fabrication costs by several orders of magnitude. To\n| limit the accumulation of particles during fabrication, assembly, and testing of filters, it is\nnecessary to control the environment during these stages of manufacturing. All filters used\nin the Space Shuttle flight system must conform to the requirements of reference 131 to |\nminimize residual contamination. The cleanliness level (residual contamination) actually is a\nmeasure of the particle release rate of the filter and therefore is greatly affected by the\n| intensity of the sampling method. Normal practice is to test only the effluent side of the\nfilter for particle release while subjecting the element to a sonically-induced cavitational\n| field (ref. 139). It should be emphasized that cleanliness levels specified for filters are only\n| an indication of particles that can potentially slough off. If the operating environment is not\n| as severe as the sampling method, the potential for sloughing particles decreases |\nproportionately.\n2.4.1.4 FILTER MATERIAL AS CONTAMINANT\nMedia migration is a commonly used term for the presence in the system fluid of particulate\n| contaminant identifiable as originating in the filter element or filter-supporting structure.\nSome filter materials are subject to media migration more than others because of the\n! method of manufacturing. Filter materials subject to migration are sintered porous metal,\npressed paper, matted fiber, glass fiber, sintered plastic, fired porcelain, bonded carbon, and\nbonded stone (ref. 12).\nMethods of testing for media migration vary considerably, and standards for verification of\nmigration vary even more. In general, the most accepted method involves a combination of\n| thermal-shock and vibration tests. A filter is exposed to its lowest service temperature for a\n| period of time and then is rapidly transferred to its highest service-temperature environment |\nfor an equal period; this procedure is repeated for several cycles. After the thermal shock\n| ,\n| 99\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n",
    "112": "} N\n\ntests, the filter is subjected to a vibration environment commensurate with its service\n\nenvironment for a specified period of time. On completion of testing, the filter is flushed\n\nwith a specified amount of fluid (usually 500 ml of Freon TF); the fluid is collected and\n\npassed through a 0.454 membrane pad. The membrane pad then is analyzed for particles\n\nidentifiable as filter or supporting-structure material. Unfortunately, the sample collected is |\ncomposed not only of possible media particles but also has residual-contamination particles.\n\nIn the simplest case, if the particles are all nonmetallic and the filter is constructed entirely\n\nof metal, it can be concluded that no media migration has occurred. If the particles are |\n\nmetallic, further analysis is required, and filter material must be distinguished from residual\n\ncontamination.\n\nIndividual particles from a representative sample of the pad can be identified with |\n| equipment such as an electron microprobe X-ray analyzer. Comparison of the chemical\n\nanalysis of a representative number of the particles with the filter-material chemistry\n\nprovides the basis for determining if media migration has occurred. This kind of analysis is\n| expensive and time consuming and is resorted to only when a visual microscopic\n\nexamination of the particles does not suffice.\n\nIt has been the practice on occasion to utilize the cleanliness-level (residual contamination)\n\nrequirements as the basis for media-migration verification. The basis is acceptable so long as\n\nthe actual residual-contamination particle counts fall well below the maximum particle\n\ncounts specified. If the cleanliness-level requirements are stringent, the above method is not :\nused. For example, the hydraulic filter for the SSME satisfactorily demonstrated no media |\n\nmigration. The pneumatic filter for the same engine had more stringent requirements, and !\n\nthe post-test particle counts exceeded the cleanliness allowable counts. It was necessary to\n\nresort to electron microprobe X-ray analysis in order to verify that the particles were not\ncomprised of filter or structure material.\n2.4.1.5 PRESSURE DROP\n| Prediction of the differential pressure created by a given flowrate presents one of the more\n\ndifficult problems in filter-element design. Generally, in the case of a surface-type element,\n\nthe pressure drop across the filter medium for either fine or coarse mesh is relatively small\n\nwhen compared with the loss created by the element entrance or exit configuration. The\n\naccepted practice is to generate flowrate-vs-differential-pressure curves by actual test after\nthe element is fabricated. Empirical equations for calculating basic flow resistance for\nvarious filter materials are presented in reference 132. The equations provide an excellent\n\nmeans for evaluating filter area requirements; however, they do not consider entrance and\n\nexit losses. The slope of the curve for pressure-drop buildup is a function of flow velocity,\n\ntype of fluid, and filter material. The collapse pressure* of an element must be greater than\n\nthe maximum transient differential pressure expected under flow conditions.\n\n\u201cCollapse pressure is the maximum differential pressure that the filter element must be able to withstand without any\n\npermanent deformation that results in rupture or degradation of performance that releases contamination into the\n\ndownstream system.\n100\n\n:\n|\n",
    "113": "|\nSystem-transient differential pressures that exceed the nominal can result in deformation of\nthe filter element. The deformation can change the flow resistance of the filter, particularly |\nin the case of a tightly pieated woven-wire-cloth configuration. The pleats can become\npinched together, thus reducing the effective area of the filter. In cases where high |\nsystem-transient differential pressures exist, a coarse backup screen is used to support the\n1 woyen-wire-cloth element.\n| A good example of a problem with filter pressure drop occurred in development of the LEM\nascent engine. A coarse filter upstream of the injector was found to be inadequate because\nfine particles contained in the propellant that passed through tended to plug the holes in the |\nthrust chamber injector. A fine pleated-wire-mesh filter was installed between the coarse\nfilter and the injector. The new filter, however, caused a new problem: after a period of\ni time, performance shifts during engine operation were noted. The shifts in the performance ;\nwere found to be due to a change in the resistance of the filter caused by pressure surges\nihe that distorted the pleated elements. A redesign of the element to eliminate the pleats\nresolved the problem. |\n|\n2.4.1.6 TESTING |\nFilters are not acceptance tested with the actual propellants used in engines because of the |\n~ difficulties (e.g., facility requirements or safety considerations) in testing with cryogenics or\nhighly toxic or corrosive propellants. Qualification tests generally are not performed with\nec actual propellants unless adequate safety precautions can be taken.

The size and shape of the case\ninfluence the filter capacity and service life. The minimization of flow restrictions and\nabrupt changes in flow direction is an important parameter. The critical area \u2014 the smallest |\ncross-sectional area of the flow passage \u2014 must be identified by the designer. All other flow\npassages naturally will have a greater area than the critical area. The flow transition from |\n* one chamber to another is made as smooth as practical.\nhe In-line cases with axial-design cylindrical or conical filter elements offer the least resistance\n| to flow and are lightest in weight. The case may be either permanently assembled by\nwelding, or it may be capable of disassembly to facilitate cleaning or replacement of the |\n| element.

DESIGN CRITERIA and ,\n| Recommended Practices\n|\n, 3.1 LINE ASSEMBLY\n| 3.1.1 Routing\n| 3.1.1.1 CENTERLINE GEOMETRY\n! 3.1.1.1.1 Flexible Lines\na\nThe centerline geometry of the line shall minimize the number of flexible joints\n\u2019 required to accommodate the design deflections.\n| Until the development of the SSME, no analytical method existed for achieving this\nobjective; however, reference 140 presents a method for a three-joint, one-plane system that\ngives some insight into the subject. Generally in a multi-leg duct design, one flex joint is\nlocated in each leg for maximum flexibility. See figure 5 for the typical wraparound,\ngimbal-plane configuration.\nKinematic design layouts locating the flex joints in their optimum positions are\nian recommended as the best technique for providing initial inputs into a space-frame program |\nlike that used on the SSME; the program then can be used to \u201cfine-tune\u201d the locations.\nOnce the joints are located, verify that the loads they create are within the capabilities of\nthe attached engine or vehicle structure. |\n3.1.1.1.2 Hard Lines\n|\n| The centerline geometry of the line shall be such that the line does not impose\n| excessive strain on attached structure.\n| |\nPrior to laying out the centerline geometry of a new hardline design, consider the structural\n| limitations of the components to which the line will be attached. Line installation tolerances\n| in the engine or vehicle and the loads they would cause the hard line to induce on the\nattaching components must be evaluated. The routing of the line then should be such as to\ni provide required flexibility without producing excessive strains on the attaching structure.\n| Figure 4 depicts some typical routings that provide installation flexibility. Utilize the\n5 modulus of elasticity and wall thickness of the hardline material to assist in providing\n| necessary flexibility.\n103\nB }\n|\n",
    "116": "|\nWhenever practical, adjacent lines should be routed in banks or rows to achieve mutual\n| support in bracketing and add to aesthetic appeal. |\n3.1.1.2 DEFLECTION LIMITATION |\n| The routing of ducts shall preclude the requirement for a given flexible joint to |\nabsorb more than one type of deflection (angular, axial, or shear) simultaneously. |\nLocate the flexible joints in the duct so as to make maximum use of their deflection |\n| capability. Figure 5 gives a practical example for achieving this condition. Locate the centers\nof the bellows on the gimbal axes, so that the bellows are required only to angulate to |\naccommodate gimballing; if they are located off-center, both shear and angulation will be rs\napplied. |\n\u00a5\n3.1.1.2.1 Maximum Bellows Joint Deflection |\n|\nThe sum of all deflections simultaneously imposed on a bellows joint shall not ,\ncause bending stresses in excess of those commensurate with the design fatigue\n.\n| See reference 82 for S-N data on typical bellows materials. When a bellows is subjected to |\nmore than one mode of deflection (e.g., angulation and shear) simultaneously, the sum of <\n| the stresses created by all modes must not exceed the total allowable. |\n|\nIf a particular bellows is subjected to combined motions and attendant stresses that do not\npermit the part to meet the design fatigue life, the motions must be reduced or additional\nbellows introduced into the system to share the deflections. For example, the duct shown in\nfigure 8 was required to accommodate a torsional deflection that caused excessive strains in\nthe axial bellows. To resolve the problem, a special bellows was inserted between the two\n] axial bellows to absorb only the torsional deflections and thus relieve the torsional strain ;\nimposed on the other bellows.\nAll the different deflection modes that a bellows can absorb result in the application of the\nsame type of bending stresses in the crowns and roots of the convolutions. Specific\ninformation on stress calculations corresponding to different types of deflections is\npresented in references 141 through 151. Methods given in reference 16 may be used to\nconvert the various modes into axial equivalents for use in stress calculations. 4\n|\n3.1.1.3 TORSIONAL DEFLECTION Z\nDuct assembly design shall preclude or minimize torsional loading on the ducts. ,\n104 J\n|\n| j\n|\n| |\n|\n",

This is, however, not a desirable method of absorbing |\n\nk operational deflections, because a dynamic fluid seal is required. |\nDog-leg ducts with angulating joints in each leg can absorb torsional deflections by angular\n\n| deflection. A recommended method for making a short, straight duct torsionally flexible is\nto incorporate a bellows limited to torsional deflection and having a low spring rate. Such a\n\n| bellows can be designed to allow a few degrees of motion within the allowable stresses of\n| the material.
