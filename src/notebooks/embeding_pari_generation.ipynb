These droplets are heated by radiation coming from the next zone (called rapid combustion zone) and also by convection of gas in the injection-and-breakup zone.', ' These droplets are heated by radiation coming from the next zone (called rapid combustion zone) and also by convection of gas in the injection-and-breakup zone. This heat causes the droplets to evaporate and create regions rich in either fuel vapour or oxidiser vapour. The injection-and-breakup zone is heterogeneous, because it contains liquid propellants, vaporised propellants, and hot gases resulting from combustion products.', ' The injection-and-breakup zone is heterogeneous, because it contains liquid propellants, vaporised propellants, and hot gases resulting from combustion products. Since the propellants in liquid phase are located at discrete places, then large variations are present in mass ﬂow rates, mixture ratios, sizes and distributions of droplets, and properties of resulting gases.', ' Since the propellants in liquid phase are located at discrete places, then large variations are present in mass ﬂow rates, mixture ratios, sizes and distributions of droplets, and properties of resulting gases. The chemical reactions occurring in the injection-and-breakup zone generate heat at low rates, and hot gases may recirculate back to the injector plate.', ' The chemical reactions occurring in the injection-and-breakup zone generate heat at low rates, and hot gases may recirculate back to the injector plate.

The processes described above occur in a different manner when one of the propellants is in the gaseous state.', ' The processes described above occur in a different manner when one of the propellants is in the gaseous state. Such is the case with gaseous hydrogen coming in contact with liquid oxygen. Gaseous hydrogen has no droplets and does not evaporate. Since the injection velocity of gaseous hydrogen is much higher (above 120 m/s, according to [ 6]) than that of liquid oxygen, then shear forces act on the liquid jets, and such forces foster the formation and the evaporation of droplets.', ' Since the injection velocity of gaseous hydrogen is much higher (above 120 m/s, according to [ 6]) than that of liquid oxygen, then shear forces act on the liquid jets, and such forces foster the formation and the evaporation of droplets.

The cylindrical sector contiguous to the injection-and-breakup zone in the direc- tion of the nozzle is called rapid combustion zone.', ' The cylindrical sector contiguous to the injection-and-breakup zone in the direc- tion of the nozzle is called rapid combustion zone. In this zone, rapid and intense chemical reactions occur at increasing high temperatures. Droplets of propellants which may be left are vaporised by convective heat. Consequently, fuel-rich and fuel-lean gases are mixed.', ' Consequently, fuel-rich and fuel-lean gases are mixed. The oxidation of the fuel occurs rapidly in this zone, and generates heat at higher rates than those of the preceding zone, with consequent decrease in density and increase in velocity of the burning gas.

The axial component of the velocity vector of a molecule of combusted gas moving along a stream line becomes gradually greater than its transverse component. The cylindrical sector contiguous to the rapid combustion zone in the axial direc- tion is called stream tube combustion zone.', ' The cylindrical sector contiguous to the rapid combustion zone in the axial direc- tion is called stream tube combustion zone. In this zone, oxidation reactions continue to occur, but at a lower rate than that of the previous zone. The gas mixture approaches an equilibrium composition. The axial component of the velocity vector (ranging from 200 to 600 m/s, according to [ 6]) of a gas molecule is much higher than its transverse component, and therefore there is little turbulent mixing between gaseous layers.', ' The axial component of the velocity vector (ranging from 200 to 600 m/s, according to [ 6]) of a gas molecule is much higher than its transverse component, and therefore there is little turbulent mixing between gaseous layers.

However, an unstable behaviour may occur there as a result of small perturbations, which cause self-sustaining oscillations of pres- sure in the burning gas.', ' However, an unstable behaviour may occur there as a result of small perturbations, which cause self-sustaining oscillations of pres- sure in the burning gas. The frequencies of these oscillations vary in a wide range. Speciﬁcally, frequencies going from less than 100 Hz to over 15,000 Hz have been measured in the combustion chamber at amplitudes going from 10 to 1000% of the pressure in steady state [ 42].', ' Speciﬁcally, frequencies going from less than 100 Hz to over 15,000 Hz have been measured in the combustion chamber at amplitudes going from 10 to 1000% of the pressure in steady state [ 42]. According to Culick and Kuentzmann [ 43], the energy taken by these oscillations is only a small part of the chemical energy made available by the propellants.', ' According to Culick and Kuentzmann [ 43], the energy taken by these oscillations is only a small part of the chemical energy made available by the propellants. There- fore, except in very severe instances, the mean thrust or the steady power of the engine is not affected by the oscillations. However, serious problems may arise because of structural vibrations excited by the oscillating pressure in the combustion chamber, and also because of oscillations of the thrust generated by the engine.', ' However, serious problems may arise because of structural vibrations excited by the oscillating pressure in the combustion chamber, and also because of oscillations of the thrust generated by the engine. In addition, the heat transfer rates between the hot gas and the internal surface of the combustion chamber can be highly increased, with consequent erosion of the chamber wall.', ' In addition, the heat transfer rates between the hot gas and the internal surface of the combustion chamber can be highly increased, with consequent erosion of the chamber wall. The unstable motion of the hot gas is self-excited as a result of an interaction of the combustion process with the structural modes of the rocket vehicle.', ' The unstable motion of the hot gas is self-excited as a result of an interaction of the combustion process with the structural modes of the rocket vehicle. This instability arises because a very small part of the chemical energy contained in the propellants is sufﬁcient to produce large unsteady motions, and also because the processes tending to attenuate such motions are weak, unless appropriate steps are taken.', ' This instability arises because a very small part of the chemical energy contained in the propellants is sufﬁcient to produce large unsteady motions, and also because the processes tending to attenuate such motions are weak, unless appropriate steps are taken. An example of these self-sustained oscillations is provided by the so-called pogo instability (see Chap.', ' An example of these self-sustained oscillations is provided by the so-called pogo instability (see Chap. 2,S e c t .2 . 9 ,a n dC h a p . 7,S e c t .7 . 6 ) ,w h i c ho c c u r si nt h ef e e d lines of large liquid-propellant rocket vehicles, such as space launch vehicles or ballistic missiles. This particular instability is due to a feedback interaction between 54 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines the propulsion system and the structure of a rocket stage, and occurs principally in the ﬁrst longitudinal mode of the structure of the vehicle during operation of its ﬁrst stage.', ' This particular instability is due to a feedback interaction between 54 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines the propulsion system and the structure of a rocket stage, and occurs principally in the ﬁrst longitudinal mode of the structure of the vehicle during operation of its ﬁrst stage. The most destructive type of combustion instability is characterised by oscillations of high frequency, and is also known as acoustic instability.', ' The most destructive type of combustion instability is characterised by oscillations of high frequency, and is also known as acoustic instability. The frequencies of these oscillations are equal to or greater than 1000 Hz [ 4]. The term acoustic instability is due to an observed correspondence, in both frequency and phase, between the pressure oscillations observed experimentally in ac o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e ra n dt h eo s c i l l a t i o n sc a l c u l a t e df o rt h ea c o u s t i cr e s o n a n c eo f the chamber.', ' The term acoustic instability is due to an observed correspondence, in both frequency and phase, between the pressure oscillations observed experimentally in ac o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e ra n dt h eo s c i l l a t i o n sc a l c u l a t e df o rt h ea c o u s t i cr e s o n a n c eo f the chamber. High-frequency instability includes both longitudinal and transverse modes, and the latter include, in turn, radial and tangential modes.', ' High-frequency instability includes both longitudinal and transverse modes, and the latter include, in turn, radial and tangential modes. In general terms, a source of oscillating energy is necessary to sustain instability. In the particular case of high-frequency instability, the source of oscillating energy is the combustion of the propellants used in a rocket engine, and depends weakly on the feed system of the engine.', ' In the particular case of high-frequency instability, the source of oscillating energy is the combustion of the propellants used in a rocket engine, and depends weakly on the feed system of the engine. The oscillating energy must, to sustain instability, be properly phased in time with the oscillating pressure, as will be shown at length in Chap.', ' The oscillating energy must, to sustain instability, be properly phased in time with the oscillating pressure, as will be shown at length in Chap. 2,S e c t .2 . 9 . Sustaining mechanisms which have been proposed for high-frequency instability include loss of ignition, sensitive chemical preparation time, physical time delays, detonation processes, pressure or temperature sensitive chemical kinetics, the burst of droplets heated beyond their critical temperature and pressure, and the shattering and mixing of the streams, fans, or drops by the motion of gas particles [ 42].', ' Sustaining mechanisms which have been proposed for high-frequency instability include loss of ignition, sensitive chemical preparation time, physical time delays, detonation processes, pressure or temperature sensitive chemical kinetics, the burst of droplets heated beyond their critical temperature and pressure, and the shattering and mixing of the streams, fans, or drops by the motion of gas particles [ 42]. Instability in a combustion chamber may start either spontaneously or as a result of some artiﬁcial perturbation.', ' Instability in a combustion chamber may start either spontaneously or as a result of some artiﬁcial perturbation. Acoustic instability may have a threshold amplitude, above which a perturbation is sustained and below which the same perturbation is damped. A rocket engine is said to be inherently stable, when it can absorb large perturbations and yet return to its operation in steady state.', ' A rocket engine is said to be inherently stable, when it can absorb large perturbations and yet return to its operation in steady state. The degree of inherent stability of a rocket engine can be measured by rating devices which provide artiﬁcial perturbations to its combustion chamber. Such perturbations involve operating condi- tions, such as mixture ratio of the propellants, pressure in the combustion chamber, temperature of the fuel, and so on.', ' Such perturbations involve operating condi- tions, such as mixture ratio of the propellants, pressure in the combustion chamber, temperature of the fuel, and so on. An instability of the spontaneous type requires no initial perturbation to start, and grows out of the noise inherent to the combustion process.', ' An instability of the spontaneous type requires no initial perturbation to start, and grows out of the noise inherent to the combustion process. An instability of this type can be expected to occur just after an engine has reached its normal oper- ating conditions, because no perturbation is required for its occurrence.', ' An instability of this type can be expected to occur just after an engine has reached its normal oper- ating conditions, because no perturbation is required for its occurrence. Variations in test conditions and the closeness to a stability boundary may sometimes delay the occurrence of a spontaneous instability.', ' Variations in test conditions and the closeness to a stability boundary may sometimes delay the occurrence of a spontaneous instability. Instability in a combustion chamber may also be induced by natural or artiﬁcial perturbations which may occur in the combustion process. Such perturbations are also known as spikes or pops, where a spike indicates a signiﬁcant overpressure in the combustion chamber upon ignition of the engine, and a pop indicates a similar overpressure occurring spontaneously during engine operation at nominal pressure in the combustion chamber.', ' Such perturbations are also known as spikes or pops, where a spike indicates a signiﬁcant overpressure in the combustion chamber upon ignition of the engine, and a pop indicates a similar overpressure occurring spontaneously during engine operation at nominal pressure in the combustion chamber. For example, at high altitudes, some combinations of hypergolic bi-propellants may start with an extremely high spike of pressure in the combustion chamber.', ' For example, at high altitudes, some combinations of hypergolic bi-propellants may start with an extremely high spike of pressure in the combustion chamber. This spike has been attributed to the explosion or deﬂagration 1.6 Combustion of Propellants in Unsteady State 55 of the propellants collected in the combustion chamber or accumulated on its walls during the period of ignition delay.', '6 Combustion of Propellants in Unsteady State 55 of the propellants collected in the combustion chamber or accumulated on its walls during the period of ignition delay. This spike of pressure may be of sufﬁcient magni- tude to either cause destructive failure in the combustion chamber or adversely affect the guidance sensor systems.', ' This spike of pressure may be of sufﬁcient magni- tude to either cause destructive failure in the combustion chamber or adversely affect the guidance sensor systems. In addition, for small rocket engines used for intermit- tent operation, the resultant thrust or the total impulse is seriously altered from that of a smooth start.', ' In addition, for small rocket engines used for intermit- tent operation, the resultant thrust or the total impulse is seriously altered from that of a smooth start. For large engines, the ignition spike can trigger resonance in the combustion process, with consequent hardware destruction [ 42]. In most cases, the combustion process in a rocket engine shows a non-linear behaviour, which requires some kind of trigger, be it natural or artiﬁcial, to cause pressure oscillations of high frequency and amplitude in the combustion chamber.', ' In most cases, the combustion process in a rocket engine shows a non-linear behaviour, which requires some kind of trigger, be it natural or artiﬁcial, to cause pressure oscillations of high frequency and amplitude in the combustion chamber. Consequently, it is necessary to determine the types and the magnitudes of the triggers which may occur in an engine during ﬂight.', ' Consequently, it is necessary to determine the types and the magnitudes of the triggers which may occur in an engine during ﬂight. This done, it is also necessary to evaluate the stability of that engine with artiﬁcial triggers of the assumed types. However, as has been shown above, a pressure oscillation may in some cases grow out of combustion noise, in the absence of any observable trigger.', ' However, as has been shown above, a pressure oscillation may in some cases grow out of combustion noise, in the absence of any observable trigger. The dynamic stability of a rocket engine is concerned with the responses of the engine to transients occurring during its operation. A rocket engine must, to be dynamically stable, return to its normal operating conditions after transients of any type which may occur to it.', ' A rocket engine must, to be dynamically stable, return to its normal operating conditions after transients of any type which may occur to it. In other words, in order for a rocket engine to be dynam- ically stable, the transients resulting from any type of operating conditions must die out, or the amplitudes of the subsequent sustained oscillations of pressure must be sufﬁciently small.', ' In other words, in order for a rocket engine to be dynam- ically stable, the transients resulting from any type of operating conditions must die out, or the amplitudes of the subsequent sustained oscillations of pressure must be sufﬁciently small. In order to evaluate the dynamic stability of a rocket engine, the engine is driven by any means into pressure oscillations of high amplitude.', ' In order to evaluate the dynamic stability of a rocket engine, the engine is driven by any means into pressure oscillations of high amplitude. If these oscillations subsequently decay to those proper to steady-state conditions, then there is sufﬁcient assurance that no oscillations of high amplitude exist within the range of the given perturbations.', ' If these oscillations subsequently decay to those proper to steady-state conditions, then there is sufﬁcient assurance that no oscillations of high amplitude exist within the range of the given perturbations. A rocket engine, which has shown a dynamically stable behaviour within the range of the operating conditions expected in ﬂight, should also remain stable in actual ﬂight.', ' A rocket engine, which has shown a dynamically stable behaviour within the range of the operating conditions expected in ﬂight, should also remain stable in actual ﬂight. Another method which may be used to gain conﬁdence in the stability of a rocket engine consists in conducting a large number of tests and ﬂight.', ' Another method which may be used to gain conﬁdence in the stability of a rocket engine consists in conducting a large number of tests and ﬂight. A conﬁdence gained in this way is called statistical stability. This conﬁdence indicates only that instability has rarely or never occurred in the operating condition tested, but not that instability can never occur.', ' This conﬁdence indicates only that instability has rarely or never occurred in the operating condition tested, but not that instability can never occur.

The necessity of this control arises from several causes. First, an intentional change of the direction of the ﬂight path followed by the centre of mass of the vehicle.', ' First, an intentional change of the direction of the ﬂight path followed by the centre of mass of the vehicle.

For a stable ﬂight, the centre of gravity of a rocket must be above its centre of pressure. The longitudinal axis of the rocket, or the line joining the tip of the nose with the centre of the exit section of the nozzle, is called the roll axis, and a motion of the rocket about the roll axis is called a rolling motion.', ' The longitudinal axis of the rocket, or the line joining the tip of the nose with the centre of the exit section of the nozzle, is called the roll axis, and a motion of the rocket about the roll axis is called a rolling motion.

These moments oppose the deﬂection of the rocket in the directions of the pitch and yaw axes.', ' These moments oppose the deﬂection of the rocket in the directions of the pitch and yaw axes. Of course, the static ﬁns must be so sized as to generate the amount of aerodynamic forces required to counteract the deviations. On the other hand, the ﬁns generate further drag, in the direction opposed to the rocket velocity vector.', ' On the other hand, the ﬁns generate further drag, in the direction opposed to the rocket velocity vector. In spite of that, aerodynamic ﬁns, be they ﬁxed or movable, are very effective for controlling a vehicle ﬂying through the atmosphere. They continue to be used in weather rockets, anti-aircraft missiles, and air-to surface missiles.', ' They continue to be used in weather rockets, anti-aircraft missiles, and air-to surface missiles.

This phenomenon can appear in thermal devices when an unsteady release of heat is coupled with pressure oscillations. In a rocket engine, the heat released by the substances which react chemically is coupled with acoustic ﬂuctu- ations.', ' In a rocket engine, the heat released by the substances which react chemically is coupled with acoustic ﬂuctu- ations. When the unsteady heat release and the acoustic ﬂuctuations are in phase, then even a small perturbation will amplify according to the criterion enunciated by Lord Rayleigh. This criterion states that “If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged.', ' This criterion states that “If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged.

In addition, “When the transfer of heat takes place at the moment of greatest condensation or of greatest rarefaction, the pitch is not affected … the pitch is raised if heat be communicated to the air a quarter period before the phase of greatest condensation; and the pitch is lowered if heat be communicated a quarter period after the phase of greatest condensation” [ 94].', ' In addition, “When the transfer of heat takes place at the moment of greatest condensation or of greatest rarefaction, the pitch is not affected … the pitch is raised if heat be communicated to the air a quarter period before the phase of greatest condensation; and the pitch is lowered if heat be communicated a quarter period after the phase of greatest condensation” [ 94]. In other terms, the oscilla- tions in a combustor are self-sustained when the rate of heat release and the pressure ﬂuctuations are in phase.', ' In other terms, the oscilla- tions in a combustor are self-sustained when the rate of heat release and the pressure ﬂuctuations are in phase. When this happens, pressure oscillations of large ampli- tude occur in a combustion chamber at frequencies of hundreds of hertz. Acoustic waves cause unsteadiness in a combustion process.', ' Acoustic waves cause unsteadiness in a combustion process. An unsteady combustion process, 186 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly in turn, generates new acoustic waves. This fact can be represented graphically by means of the following feedback scheme. An unsteady release of heat adds energy to the acoustic waves in the combustion chamber, when the unsteady heat release rate is in phase with the pressure oscillations at the location of the heat source, in accordance with the criterion of Lord Rayleigh.', ' An unsteady release of heat adds energy to the acoustic waves in the combustion chamber, when the unsteady heat release rate is in phase with the pressure oscillations at the location of the heat source, in accordance with the criterion of Lord Rayleigh. Consequently, the ﬂame in the chamber may be extinguished or may come back to the injector face and burn part of the injection system.', ' Consequently, the ﬂame in the chamber may be extinguished or may come back to the injector face and burn part of the injection system. The amplitude of these oscillations can become so large as to damage the structure of the combustion chamber or destroy the engine. These pressure waves can travel at sonic velocities up and down the length of the combustion chamber, around it, across it, or radially in and out.', ' These pressure waves can travel at sonic velocities up and down the length of the combustion chamber, around it, across it, or radially in and out.

As a general rule, the choice of a feed system, independently of whether it uses gases under pressure or pumps, depends on several factors, which are principally the mission which the rocket vehicle is meant to accomplish, the size and the mass of this vehicle, the intensity and the duration of the thrust, the space available to the engine, the degree of reliability of the propulsion system, and so on.', ' As a general rule, the choice of a feed system, independently of whether it uses gases under pressure or pumps, depends on several factors, which are principally the mission which the rocket vehicle is meant to accomplish, the size and the mass of this vehicle, the intensity and the duration of the thrust, the space available to the engine, the degree of reliability of the propulsion system, and so on. In practice, according to Lee et al.', ' In practice, according to Lee et al. [ 2], a pump-fed propulsion system is chosen when: •the engine must produce more than 4500 N of thrust, or •the total mass exceeds 9100 kg. In contrast, a pressure-fed propulsion system, which may be either a mono- propellant or a bi-propellant system, is chosen when: •the mission duty cycle is a pulse mode, or •the propellant mass is less than 3600 kg.', ' In contrast, a pressure-fed propulsion system, which may be either a mono- propellant or a bi-propellant system, is chosen when: •the mission duty cycle is a pulse mode, or •the propellant mass is less than 3600 kg. For those cases in which the choice of the feed system is not obvious, a weight- and-cost trade-off study is made to determine the better system.', ' For those cases in which the choice of the feed system is not obvious, a weight- and-cost trade-off study is made to determine the better system. The types of gas used in the feed systems described here are the following: •gases stored for bi-propellants; •gases obtained by evaporation of two propellants; •gases stored for mono-propellants; and •gases obtained as combustion products.', ' The types of gas used in the feed systems described here are the following: •gases stored for bi-propellants; •gases obtained by evaporation of two propellants; •gases stored for mono-propellants; and •gases obtained as combustion products. Some criteria for choosing one or another of these types are brieﬂy presented below.', ' Some criteria for choosing one or another of these types are brieﬂy presented below. A gas under pressure must be chemically compatible with the propellants and also with the materials of which the tanks and the lines are made, at the temperatures of operation. The feed system using this gas must be simple and reliable.', ' The feed system using this gas must be simple and reliable. The gas used in the feed system must have a low molar mass, in order for the value of the mass ratio m0/mu(where m0is the mass of the rocket vehicle at launch, and muis its mass at burnout) to be low. The materials used for the feed system must have a low speciﬁc mass, for the same reason.', ' The materials used for the feed system must have a low speciﬁc mass, for the same reason. These requirements will be discussed in the following paragraphs. 3.2 Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure When the time of operation of a rocket engine is short, or when the temperature of the gas stored under pressure is less than or equal to the temperature of the propellants, then the required mass mg(kg) of that gas can be computed by means of the law of perfect gases, as follows 3.', '2 Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure When the time of operation of a rocket engine is short, or when the temperature of the gas stored under pressure is less than or equal to the temperature of the propellants, then the required mass mg(kg) of that gas can be computed by means of the law of perfect gases, as follows 3.2 Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure 205 mg=pTVT RgTg where pT(N/m2)i st h ep r e s s u r eo ft h eg a si nt h et a n k , VT(m3)i st h et o t a lv o l u m eo f the empty tank, Rg(N m kg−1K−1)i st h ec o n s t a n to ft h es p e c i ﬁ cg a su s e d ,a n d Tg (K) is the mean temperature of that gas.', '2 Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure 205 mg=pTVT RgTg where pT(N/m2)i st h ep r e s s u r eo ft h eg a si nt h et a n k , VT(m3)i st h et o t a lv o l u m eo f the empty tank, Rg(N m kg−1K−1)i st h ec o n s t a n to ft h es p e c i ﬁ cg a su s e d ,a n d Tg (K) is the mean temperature of that gas.

They have been used especially for oxidisers, because most fuels tend to boil violently when heated. However, liquid hydrogen, which is a fuel, is an exception to this rule. Since the oxidiser vapour has usually a high molar mass, feed systems using evaporation of two propellants require a mass of pressurising gas for the oxidiser tank higher than the mass required by systems using inert gases, such as those described in Sect.', ' Since the oxidiser vapour has usually a high molar mass, feed systems using evaporation of two propellants require a mass of pressurising gas for the oxidiser tank higher than the mass required by systems using inert gases, such as those described in Sect. 3.3.

The simplest method of evaporated-propellant pressurisation is self-pressurisation (ﬂash boiling) in a propellant tank during feed-out.', ' The simplest method of evaporated-propellant pressurisation is self-pressurisation (ﬂash boiling) in a propellant tank during feed-out. By the way, ﬂash boiling is the phenomenon which occurs in a heated liquid whose pressure is lower than the saturation vapour pressure of the liquid. When the pressure falls sufﬁciently below the saturation vapour pressure, then rapid boiling of the liquid can result.', ' When the pressure falls sufﬁciently below the saturation vapour pressure, then rapid boiling of the liquid can result. The self-pressurisation method is reliable, but the mass requirements of the pres- surising agent are high, because of its low temperature, and hence of its high density. In addition, pre-pressurisation from a separate system may be necessary to meet engine start requirements, as was the case with the Centaur rocket vehicle [ 2].', ' In addition, pre-pressurisation from a separate system may be necessary to meet engine start requirements, as was the case with the Centaur rocket vehicle [ 2].

In systems requiring higher pressures, superheated vapour is obtained by passing the propellant through an engine heat exchanger or some other heat source, as will be shown below.', ' In systems requiring higher pressures, superheated vapour is obtained by passing the propellant through an engine heat exchanger or some other heat source, as will be shown below. More favourable conditions exist in the ullage space when the pressurising agent is heated to the maximum temperature compatible with structural and propellant requirements, and when the temperature of the gas in the ullage space is stratiﬁed, that is, controlled by heating or cooling at the tank wall and upper bulkhead [ 2].', ' More favourable conditions exist in the ullage space when the pressurising agent is heated to the maximum temperature compatible with structural and propellant requirements, and when the temperature of the gas in the ullage space is stratiﬁed, that is, controlled by heating or cooling at the tank wall and upper bulkhead [ 2].

These problems can be solved by using control systems, which are described in the present paragraph.', ' These problems can be solved by using control systems, which are described in the present paragraph.
