What principle explains the steady motion of a rocket when hot gases are ejected from its combustion chamber?," High-thrust propulsion systems for rocket engines use chemical propellants, which are burned in the combustion chamber of a rocket to generate thrust. According to Newton’s third law of motion (to every action there is always opposed an equal reaction), the continuous ejection of a stream of hot gases in one direction causes a steady motion of the rocket in the opposite direction."

The oxidiser combines with the fuel in a proper mixture ratio, as will be shown in Sect."

These categories are solid-propellant motors, liquid-propellant engines, gaseous-propellant engines and hybrid-propellant engines, the last of them being those which use propellants stored in at least two of the three (solid, liquid, and gaseous) physical states of matter."

What factors influence the thrust magnitude in a rocket engine utilizing a converging-diverging nozzle?," In the rocket engine illustrated above, the magnitude Fof the thrust vector Fdepends on the propellant mass flow rate . m equivalent dm/dtthrough the engine, on the magnitude veof the exit velocity vector veof the exhaust gas, and on the pressure peof the gas at the exit plane of the nozzle. The principle of functioning of a converging-diverging nozzle (also known as a de Laval nozzle, after the name of its inventor, Gustaf de Laval) is illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA-JPL [ 1]."
What speed does a compressible fluid reach in the throat of a properly designed nozzle?," As has been shown by Crown [ 2], a compressible fluid at virtually zero velocity in the combustion chamber is accelerated through the converging portion of the nozzle to sonic speed ( M=1) in the throat where, if the converging portion is properly designed, the flow is uniform and parallel. The fluid is then expanded in the diverging portion of the nozzle until the desired Mach number M>1i sr e a c h e di n the test section, where the flow is again uniform and parallel."
What occurs at the minimum cross-sectional area in a nozzle that facilitates the transition from subsonic flow to sonic flow?," In other words, the cross-section (perpendicular to the gas flow) of the nozzle immediately downstream of the combustion chamber decreases, in order for the subsonic flow ( M<1 )t oi n c r e a s ei t ss p e e du pt ot h es p e e do fs o u n d( M=1). The sonic flow condition is reached in the throat, where the cross-sectional area A of the nozzle reaches its minimum value At."
What must happen to the cross-sectional area of the nozzle in supersonic conditions for the exhaust gases to expand downstream?,"I no r d e rf o rt h e fl o wt oi n c r e a s ef u r t h e ri t s 1.1 The Generation of Thrust 3 speed in supersonic conditions ( M>1 ) ,t h ee x h a u s tg a s e sm u s te x p a n dd o w n s t r e a m of the throat, and therefore the cross-sectional area Aof the nozzle must increase (A>At). This is because, in the converging portion of the nozzle, the maximum uniform velocity which can be reached by the flow in any section is the velocity corresponding to the local velocity of sound."
What should the gas pressure in the nozzle's exit plane be equal to for optimal thrust performance?," Further increases in velocity can only be obtained by expanding the gas in the subsequent diverging portion of the nozzle. For optimum performance in terms of thrust, the gas pressure, pe,a tt h ee x i tp l a n e of the nozzle should be exactly equal to the pressure, p0,d u et ot h ee n v i r o n m e n t around it."
What happens to rocket thrust as the exit area increases in a vacuum?," In the vacuum of space ( p0=0), this is impossible. The bigger the exit area, Ae,o ft h en o z z l e ,t h ec l o s e rt h er o c k e tg e t st ot h eo p t i m u mt h r u s t .H o w e v e r , at some point, the additional thrust gained is not worth the added mass which is necessary to make the exit area bigger."
What is the term used for a nozzle that ends before exhaust gas achieves outside environmental pressure?," In conditions of optimum expansion ratio, the rocket motor produces the maximum thrust. A nozzle, which ends before the exhaust gas reaches the pressure of the outside environment, is called an under- expanded nozzle. In these conditions, the rocket does not get all the thrust available from its engine, because the expansion ratio is too low, and therefore the exhaust gas pressure is greater than the environmental pressure."
What type of nozzle is characterized by an excessive exit area resulting in gas expansion prior to exiting?," By contrast, a nozzle, whose cross-sectional area at the exit plane is too large, is called an over-expanded nozzle. This occurs when the expansion ratio Ae/Atis too high, and the pressure of the exhaust gas is less than the environmental pressure. Since the cross-sectional area at the exit plane Aeis too large, then the exhaust gas completely expands before reaching the exit plane of the nozzle."
What is the challenge in achieving the ideal expansion ratio for gas flow in the atmosphere?," The gas flow downstream of the exit plane, as a function of the ambient pressure, is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3]. In the atmosphere, it is dif ficult to get the optimum expansion ratio, because the air pressure changes with temperature and altitude. Since a given expansion ratio results in the optimum expansion only at a speci fic altitude, then the design expansion ratio 41 F u n d a m e n t a l C o n c e p t s o n L i q u i d - P r o p e l l a n t R o c k e t E n g i n e s of the nozzle must be selected in such a way as to give the best average performance during powered flight."
What relationship describes the thrust produced by the gas flow in a spacecraft involving mass flow rate and exit velocity?," With reference to the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 4], the thrust imparted to the spacecraft by the gas flow can be expressed as follows F= . mve where . mis the mass flow rate of the exhaust gas, and veis its velocity at the exit plane of the nozzle. Therefore, for a constant mass flow rate ."
What factors influence the thrust produced by a spacecraft's engine regarding gas velocity and environmental pressure?," mor weight flow rate . W=g0 . mof exhaust gas, the thrust Fis proportional to the velocity veof the gas at the exit plane. As p a c e c r a f ti ss u b j e c tn o to n l yt ot h et h r u s td u et oi t se n g i n e ,b u ta l s ot ot h e pressure, p0,d u et ot h ee n v i r o n m e n ta r o u n di t ."
What can be considered equal to zero at high altitudes when analyzing forces on gas in the thrust chamber?,"A th i g ha l t i t u d e s , p0can be assumed to be equal to zero. In these conditions, the net force acting on the gas contained in the thrust chamber (comprising the combustion chamber and the nozzle) is the sum of the reactions coming from the walls and of the reaction of the absolute pressure of gas at the exit plane."
What must the net force on the gas equal according to the second principle of dynamics?," These two reaction forces are opposed, as shown in the preceding figure. Therefore, according to the second principle of dynamics, the net force acting on the gas must be equal to the momentum flux out of the thrust chamber, which is 0/integraldisplay AtcptcdA - Aepe= . mve where Atcandptcare respectively the area and the pressure of the thrust chamber, Ae, ve,a n d peare respectively the area, the gas velocity, and the static absolute pressure of the gas at the exit plane of the nozzle, and ."
What does the first term on the left-hand side of the equation represent in relation to the thrust chamber?," mis the steady mass flow rate of the gas. The integral, that is, the first term on the left-hand side of the preceding equation, 1.1 The Generation of Thrust 5 represent the integral of the pressure forces (resultant) acting on the thrust chamber (combustion chamber and nozzle) and projected onto a plane normal to the axis of symmetry of the thrust chamber, as shown in the preceding figure."
What conditions must be met for the force equation F = mve + Aepe to be valid in a thrust chamber?," This integral is just the force, F,w h i c ha c t so nt h et h r u s tc h a m b e r( a n d ,t h e r e f o r e ,o nt h es p a c e c r a f t ) . Consequently, the preceding equation may also be written as follows F= . mve+Aepe This equality holds under the following hypotheses: •the injection flow velocity of the propellants is negligible; •the flow is constant and does not change with time during the burn; •the products of combustion are in chemical equilibrium after the burn; •the flow of gas through the exit plane of the nozzle is one-dimensional, that is, all the molecules of the ejected gas move on straight lines which are parallel to the axis of symmetry of the nozzle; •the flow is compressible, that is, the gas density is subject to signi ficant changes; •the flow is isentropic, that is, frictionless and adiabatic (without heat loss), and therefore depends only on the cross-sectional areas of the nozzle; and •the gas flowing in the nozzle is a perfect gas, so that the well-known equation of state p= rho RTinvolving pressure p, density rho ,a n dt e m p e r a t u r e Tcan be used, where Ris the constant of the speci fic gas (the universal gas constant R* =8314."
What is the relationship between the average molar mass of exhaust gas and the specific gas constant for water in terms of thrust?,"460 N m kmol - 1K - 1divided by the average molar mass M(kg/kmol) of the exhaust gas; for example, if the exhaust gas were water, H 2O, then R= 8314.460/18 =461.9 N m kg - 1K - 1). In the thrust equation written above, the quantity . mis called the momentum thrust, and the quantity Aepeis called the pressure thrust."
What happens to the gas pressure generated by chemical energy in the thrust chamber?," The latter term indicates that some (but not all) of the total forces due to the pressure ptcin the thrust chamber contribute to the kinetic energy possessed by the exhaust gases flowing in the nozzle. In other words, a part of the gas pressure generated by the release of chemical energy is used to increase the gas momentum, whereas another part is not."
How does firing a rocket at low altitudes with ambient pressure affect the efficiency of the nozzle?," The greater the part of gas pressure used for this purpose, the greater the ef ficiency of the nozzle. Let us assume now that the rocket is fired at an ambient pressure p0greater than zero, that is, at low-altitudes. In these conditions, the pressure forces due to the environment and acting on the outside of the thrust chamber walls have no effect on the gas inside."
What effect does ambient pressure have on the thrust chamber area in relation to total pressure thrust?," However, such pressure forces subtract a part ( Aep0)f r o mt h et o t a l pressure thrust ( Aepe). Since the exhaust gas flows at supersonic velocity through the exit plane of area Ae,t h e nt h ea m b i e n tp r e s s u r e p0cannot gain access to it. Therefore, the ambient pressure generates a net unbalanced force onto the projected thrust chamber area, in the direction opposed to the thrust, of magnitude Aep0."
"How can the thrust equation be expressed in another form involving mass, exit velocity, and pressure differences?",T h i s fact is taken into account by re-writing the equation of thrust as follows F= . mve+Ae(pe - p0) 61 F u n d a m e n t a l C o n c e p t s o n L i q u i d - P r o p e l l a n t R o c k e t E n g i n e s which is just the equation given in [ 1]. The same equation may also be written as follows F= .
What condition must be met for the effective exhaust velocity to equal the exhaust gas velocity at the nozzle exit?," mve+Ae(pe - p0)= . mc where c=ve+Ae(pe - p0) . m is called the effective exhaust velocity, whose value is the same as that of the exhaust gas velocity veat the exit plane of the nozzle only when the gas pressure peat the same plane is equal to the ambient pressure p0.A sh a sb e e ns h o w na b o v e ,t h ep r e s e n c e of the second addend on the right-hand side of the preceding equation indicates that the optimum value of vehas not been reached."
What is the thrust value for the rocket engine operating at sea level?," As an application of these concepts to a practical case, taken from [ 4], it is required to compute the exhaust gas velocity veat the exit plane of the nozzle, the thrust in space, and the effective exhaust velocities at sea level ( c)a n di ns p a c e( cs), for a rocket engine having a thrust F=4.448 ×105N at sea level, a mass flow rate ."
What is the equation used to calculate exhaust velocity based on thrust and pressure differences at the exit plane?," m=167.5k g/sd u et op r o p e l l a n tc o n s u m p t i o n ,a na r e a Ae=0.4905 m2at the exit plane of the nozzle, and an absolute pressure pe=7.377 ×104N/m2at the same plane. The atmospheric pressure p0at sea level has the standard value 101325 ≈ 1.013 ×105N/m2. In order to compute the value of ve,w eu s et h ee q u a t i o no ft h r u s tw r i t t e na b o v e solved for ve, as follows ve=F - Ae(pe - p0) ."
What is the calculated velocity of the rocket engine's exhaust gas at the exit plane?," m=4.448×105 - 0.4905 ×(0.7377 - 1.013)×105 167.5 =2736 m/s Since the pressure peof the exhaust gas at the exit plane of the nozzle is smaller than the atmospheric pressure p0at sea level, then the nozzle of the rocket engine considered in the present example is too long for sea level conditions. During the ascent of the rocket, the value of the atmospheric pressure decreases continuously."
"At what altitude does the exhaust gas pressure equal the atmospheric pressure, resulting in zero thrust component?"," When the rocket reaches a certain altitude h*a b o v et h es e al e v e l ,t h e atmospheric pressure at that altitude and the exhaust gas pressure peat the exit plane of the nozzle have the same value (in the present case, this value is 7.377 ×104 N/m2), and therefore the value of the component Ae(pe - p0)o ft h et h r u s tb e c o m e s equal to zero."
What atmospheric pressure value causes the term Aep0 to equal zero during the ideal expansion of gas flow?," This event represents an ideal expansion of the gas flow. At an altitude hgreater than h*, the value of the atmospheric pressure p0becomes less than 7.377 ×104N/m2,a n di se q u a lt oz e r oi ns p a c e .W h e nt h i sh a p p e n s ,t h ev a l u eo ft h et e r m Aep0,w h i c ha p p e a r so nt h er i g h t - h a n ds i d eo ft h ee q u a t i o no ft h r u s t ,i sa l s oe q u a lt o zero."

How is the area ratio between two cross-sectional areas of a nozzle expressed mathematically in terms of Mach number and specific heat ratio?," By using the equations written above, it is possible to express the area ratio between any cross-sectional area Ax(where M=Mx)a n dt h et h r o a t cross-sectional area At(where Mt=1) of the nozzle as follows [ 2]: ( Ax At ) 2 =1 M2x [ ( 2 gamma +1 ) ( 1+ gamma - 1 2M2 x ) ] gamma +1 gamma - 1 Let 1 and 2 be two cross-sections of the nozzle at two arbitrary points along its axis of symmetry."

The preceding equation, also known as the Euler equation, is a particular case of the general Navier-Stokes equations [ 7]. Since the flow is not only steady but also isentropic ( p/ rho gamma =constant), then the following equality holds dp p= gamma d rho rho The two equations written above, combined together, yield vdv= - dp rho = - ( dp d rho ) ( d rho rho ) = - a2d rho rho where a= ( dp d rho ) 1 2 is the velocity of sound in the flowing gas."
What happens to flow velocity when the cross-sectional area of a nozzle decreases in subsonic conditions?," Since M=v/ais the Mach number, then by multiplying and dividing the quantity on the left-hand side of the preceding equation by vthere results v2dv v= - a2d rho rho that is, M2dv v= - d rho rho 12 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines By combining the preceding equation with the equation ( rho Av=constant) which expresses the principle of mass conservation, there results ( 1 - M2 ) dv v=dA A For subsonic flow ( M< 1), a decrease in the cross-sectional area ( dA<0 )o f the nozzle causes the flow velocity to increase ( dv>0 ) ."

The chemical reaction, which takes place in the combustion chamber when the fuel combines with the oxidiser, is an oxidation."
What is the mass in kilograms of water produced from two kilomoles of hydrogen and one kilomole of oxygen during combustion?," When the fuel is hydrogen (H 2) and the oxidiser is oxygen (O 2), the product of the combustion is water (H 2O) in its gaseous state, due to of the high temperature generated when hydrogen burns in the presence of oxygen, according to the well-known reaction 2H2+O2→2H2O+heat This means that, in each second, two kilomoles of hydrogen (that is, 2 ×2×1 =4k go fh y d r o g e n )r e a c tw i t ho n ek i l o m o l eo fo x y g e n( t h a ti s ,2 ×16=32 kg of 14 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines oxygen) to form two kilomoles of water (that is, 2 ×(2+16)=36 kg of water)."

When used for rockets, hydrogen and oxygen are most often stored in their liquid state of aggregation, at very low temperatures (cryogenic propellants)."
What is the maximum temperature for hydrogen to remain liquid at atmospheric pressure?," This is because they take less space in the liquid state than in the gaseous state at normal temperature and pressure conditions. Hydrogen remains liquid without evaporating at atmospheric pressure (101325 N/m2)a tat e m p e r a t u r en o th i g h e rt h a n2 0K ,a n do x y g e nd o e st h e same at a temperature not higher than 90 K [ 9]."
What temperature must liquid methane be stored at for effective use in propulsion?," Another cryogenic fuel used for space propulsion is liquid methane (CH 4), which requires a storage at a temperature not higher than 111 K [ 10]. The related chemical reaction with liquid oxygen is [ 10]: CH 4+2O2→CO 2+2H2O+heat In each second, one kilomole of methane (that is, 12 +4×1=16 kg of methane) reacts with two kilomoles of oxygen (that is, 2 ×2×16=64 kg of oxygen) to form one kilomole of carbon dioxide (that is, 12 +2×16=44 kg of carbon dioxide) and two kilomoles of water (that is, 2 ×(2+16)=36 kg of water)."
What is the maximum storage temperature in Kelvin for liquid fluorine used with a cryogenic oxidiser?," The corresponding stoichiometric mixture ratio ( o/f)b e t w e e nt h eo x i d i s e r( o)a n dt h ef u e l( f)i s o f equivalent . mo . mf=64 16=4 Ac r y o g e n i co x i d i s e rw h i c hc a nb eu s e de i t h e ra l o n eo ri nc o m b i n a t i o nw i t hl i q u i d oxygen is liquid fluorine (F 2), which requires a storage at a temperature not higher than 85 K."
Why are cryogenic propellants unsuitable for military rockets intended for extended readiness?," Fluorine is extremely toxic and reacts violently with most substances [10]. Cryogenic propellants are dif ficult to store over long periods of time, due to the low temperatures required by them. Therefore, they are not used in military rockets, which must be taken in a state of readiness for launch over times of several months."
What factor makes liquid hydrogen less efficient for storage compared to other fuels?," In addition, liquid hydrogen requires a storage volume many times greater than that required by other fuels, because of its very low density (70.85 kg/m3). On the other hand, the higher performance made available by cryogenic propellants makes them particularly attractive when constraints of storage and reaction time are not critical."
What is the specific impulse in space for the RS-25 engines used in the Space Shuttle orbiter?," For example, according to Aerojet Rocketdyne [ 11], the RS-25 engines aboard the Space Shuttle orbiter use liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and have a speci fic impulse in space (see Sect. 1.3)o f4 5 1s .T h eR L 1 0e n g i n e so nt h eC e n t a u r ,t h eU S first liquid-hydrogen/liquid-oxygen rocket stage, have a speci fic impulse in space of 433 s [ 12]."
What is the specific impulse in space of the J-2 engines used on the Saturn V?," The J-2 engines used on the Saturn V second and third stages and on the second stage of the Saturn 1B also burn the liquid-hydrogen/liquid-oxygen combination. They have a speci fic impulse in space of 424 s [ 13]. By comparison, 1.2 The Gas Flow Through the Combustion Chamber and the Nozzle 15 the liquid-oxygen/kerosene combination used in the cluster of five F-1 engines in the Saturn V first stage has a speci fic impulse in space of 304 s [ 14]."
What is the mass of carbon monoxide produced from the combustion of two kilomoles of dodecane?," In a few words, liquid hydrogen, in comparison with other fuels (such as kerosene), yields more power per unit volume of storage. When the fuel is a hydrocarbon (for example, kerosene), the oxidation reaction may be represented [ 10]a sf o l l o w s 2C12H26+25O 2→24CO +26H 2O+heat In each second, two kilomoles of dodecane (that is, 2 ×12×12+2×26= 340 kg of dodecane) react with twenty- five kilomoles of oxygen (that is, 25 ×2× 16=800 kg of oxygen) to form twenty-four kilomoles of carbon monoxide (that is, 24×(12+16)=672 kg of carbon monoxide) and twenty-six kilomoles of water (that is, 26 ×(2+16)=468 kg of water)."
What is the approximate stoichiometric mixture ratio between the oxidiser and the fuel for kerosene combustion based on the given equivalent values?," The corresponding stoichiometric mixture ratio ( o/f)b e t w e e nt h eo x i d i s e r( o)a n dt h ef u e l( f)i s o f equivalent . mo . mf=800 340≈2.35 It is to be noted that kerosene is a mixture of hydrocarbons. The chemical compo- sition of kerosene depends on its source. It usually consists of about ten different hydrocarbons, each of them containing from 10 to 16 carbon atoms per molecule; the constituents include n-dodecane, alkyl benzenes, and naphthalene and its derivatives."
What military specification does RP-1 conform to for its use as rocket fuel?," Kerosene is usually represented by the single compound n-dodecane. In particular, RP-1 is a special type of highly-re fined kerosene which conforms to Military Spec- i fication MIL-R-25576 and is used as a fuel for rocket engines [ 10]. For example, RP-1 is used in the first-stage boosters of the Delta and Atlas-Centaur rockets."
What type of fuels has fewer storage constraints compared to cryogenic fuels?," It also powered the first stages of the Saturn 1B and Saturn V [ 10]. Hydrocarbon-based fuels do not pose the severe constraints of storage which are peculiar to cryogenic fuels. On the other hand, as has been shown above, the speci fic impulse yielded by them is considerably less than that made available by cryogenic fuels."
"What are hypergolic propellants, and how do they ignite?"," Another class of substances used for space propulsion includes the hypergolic propellants, that is, speci fic couples of fuels and oxidisers which ignite sponta- neously and violently when one gets in touch with the other, without the need for any ignition source. Such propellants remain liquid at normal temperatures."
"What type of propellants are characterized by their toxicity and corrosiveness, requiring careful handling?"," These prop- erties make them particularly suitable for propulsion and hydraulic power systems carried aboard spacecraft, and in particular for those which are meant to be used for orbital manoeuvring. On the other hand, hypergolic propellants are extremely toxic and/or corrosive and must be handled with the highest care."
What are the typical oxidizers combined with the common hypergolic fuels mentioned?," The most common fuels used in hypergolic propellants are hydrazine (N 2H4), monomethyl hydrazine (CH 3(NH)NH 2), unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H 2NN(CH 3)2), and Aerozine 50, the last being an equal mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine. According to Nufer [ 15], the oxidisers used in combination with the fuels named above are usually nitrogen tetroxide (N 2O4)a n dv a r i o u sb l e n d so fn i t r o g e nt e t r o x i d e 16 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines with nitric oxide (NO)."
What systems on the Space Shuttle orbiter utilize hypergolic propellants?," Hypergolic propellants are used in the core liquid-propellant stages of the Titan family of launch vehicles, and on the Delta launcher. The Space Shuttle orbiter uses hypergolic propellants in its orbital manoeuvring subsystem for orbital insertion, main orbital manoeuvres, and de-orbit. It also uses hypergols in its reaction control system for attitude control [ 10]."
What is the specific impulse range achieved in the Space Shuttle's reaction control system when using monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide?," The ef ficiency (in terms of speci fic impulse) reached in the Space Shuttle by combining monomethyl hydrazine with nitrogen tetroxide ranges from 260 to 280 s in the reaction control system, and to 313 s in the orbital manoeuvring subsystem, the higher ef ficiency of the latter being attributed by NASA [ 10]t oh i g h e re x p a n s i o nr a t i o si nt h en o z z l e sa n dh i g h e r pressures in the combustion chambers."
What components are used to transfer the fuel and oxidiser to the combustion chamber in a liquid-propellant rocket?," In a liquid-propellant rocket, the fuel and the oxidiser are stored in two separate containers, and are sent to the combustion chamber by means of two separate systems of pipes, valves, and pumps. As the sequel will show, a liquid-propellant engine is more complex than a solid-propellant motor, but has several advantages over the latter."
What is the purpose of controlling the flow of propellant in the combustion chamber?," This is because the former offers the possibility of controlling the flow of propellant towards the combustion chamber, thereby permitting of throttling, stopping, or re- starting the engine. The liquid propellants are introduced into the combustion chamber at the injecting plane with a small axial velocity, vinj,w h i c hi sa s s u m e dt ob ee q u a lt oz e r oi nt h e present calculation."
How does the density of gas change within the combustion chamber due to the combustion process?," The combustion proceeds throughout the length of the combus- tion chamber, and is presumed to be complete at the inlet plane of the nozzle. The density of the gas decreases from one section of the combustion chamber to the other, due to the heat of combustion released between these sections. Since the mass flow rate remains constant, the gas accelerates toward the inlet section of the nozzle, and its pressure decreases."
What happens to the stagnation pressure within the combustion chamber during the expansion process?," In practice, the gas flow within the combustion chamber is not entirely isentropic, that is, the expansion process within the combustion chamber is neither fully irre- versible nor fully adiabatic. The stagnation temperature, Ts,r e m a i n sn e a r l yc o n s t a n t , but the stagnation pressure, ps,d e c r e a s e s ."
What factors influence energy loss in gases based on the specific heat ratio and the ratio of cross-sectional areas in a combustion chamber?,"T h i sc a u s e sa ne n e r g yl o s s ,w h i c hd e p e n d s on the speci fic heat ratio, gamma ,o ft h eg a s ,a n da l s oo nt h en o z z l ec o n t r a c t i o na r e ar a t i o , Ac/At,w h e r e Acis the area of the cross-section of the combustion chamber, and At is the area of the cross-section of the throat."
How does gas acceleration in the combustion chamber differ in efficiency compared to that in the nozzle?," The energy loss occurs where the accel- eration of gases is affected by expansion due to heat release, as is the case in the combustion chamber, rather than by a change of area, as is the case in the nozzle. The greater the acceleration of the gas flow given by the nozzle, the more ef ficient the process is."
What is the expression for the total pressure ratio at the injecting plane to the total pressure at the nozzle inlet in terms of the Mach number?," The following figure, adapted from [ 16], shows the static pressure p,t h et e m p e r - ature T,a n dt h ev e l o c i t y vof a gas flowing from the inlet plane to the exit plane of a converging-diverging nozzle. 1.2 The Gas Flow Through the Combustion Chamber and the Nozzle 17 Neglecting the velocity of the gas flow at the injecting plane ( vinj=0) and assuming the total pressure of the combustion chamber at the injecting plane ( pc)injto be equal to the pressure of the injector pinj(that is, assuming ( pc)inj=pinj), the total pressure ratio ( pc)inj/(pc)nscan be expressed as follows [ 4]: (pc)inj (pc)ns=1+ gamma M2 i/parenleftBig 1+ gamma - 1 2M2 i/parenrightBig gamma gamma - 1 where ( pc)nsis the total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet, Mi is the Mach number at the nozzle inlet plane, and gamma equivalent cp/cvis the speci fic heat ratio of the gas."
What is the relationship between the inlet Mach number and static pressure ratio in the context of energy conservation in a converging nozzle?," The preceding equation results from the equation of energy written for the converging portion of nozzle, which goes from the inlet plane (where the Mach number of the gas flow is Mi)t ot h et h r o a tp l a n e( w h e r et h eM a c hn u m b e ro ft h eg a s flow is Mt=1). In case of the static pressure ratio pinj/pi,t h ep r e c e d i n ge q u a t i o nc a n be simpli fied as follows 18 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines pinj pi=1+ gamma M2 i In order to reduce the energy loss mentioned above, a small value (that is, consid- erably smaller than unity) is desirable for Mi."

In this manner, a combustion chamber performs ef ficiently its function of converting a propellant into a gas of high temperature and pressure through combus- tion."
What characteristic of the cross-section occurs at the throat of a converging-diverging nozzle?," This gas is then accelerated within the nozzle, as will be shown below. The nozzles used in rocket engines are of the converging-diverging (de Laval) type, as has been shown in Sect. 1.1.I nan o z z l eo ft h i st y p e ,t h ea r e ao ft h ec r o s s - s e c t i o n decreases and reaches its minimum value at the throat."
"What happens to the velocity of gas flow as it moves through a nozzle, specifically after the throat?"," Downstream of the throat, this area increases to the exit plane of the nozzle. The velocity of the gas flow increases, reaches the sonic value at the throat, and then increases further to supersonic values in the diverging portion of the nozzle. As has been shown in Sect. 1.1,t h eg a s fl o wt h r o u g ht h en o z z l ei sa s s u m e dt ob ea n isentropic expansion."
What condition must remain constant throughout the nozzle for the pressure ratio to be considered critical?," The total temperature and the total pressure of the gas are also assumed to remain constant throughout the nozzle.

What happens to the pressure of gas in the diverging section of the nozzle during ideal expansion?," The sonic velocity ( Mt=1) of the gas flow is reached in the throat independently of whether the value of the ambient pressure (p0)a tt h ee x i tp l a n eo ft h en o z z l eb e ,o rb en o t ,l e s st h a nt h ev a l u eo ft h eg a sp r e s s u r e at the throat. In case of an ideal expansion ( p0=pe), the pressure of the gas flowing in the diverging portion of the nozzle continues to decrease, as shown in the preceding figure."
What are the two primary methods by which pressure increases in the diverging section of a nozzle?," Otherwise, an increase in pressure occurs in the diverging portion of the nozzle. This increase in pressure may take place either by isentropic subsonic deceleration of the gas flow, or by non-isentropic discontinuities (called shock waves), or by a combination of both of these manners. An example of shock waves in a gas flow is shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [ 17]."
What phenomenon causes the formation of shock diamonds in the exhaust plume of the Space Shuttle's engines?," 1.2 The Gas Flow Through the Combustion Chamber and the Nozzle 19 The blue cones of light, which appear below the three main engines of the Space Shuttle, are known as shock (or Mach) diamonds. They are due to the formation of shock waves in the exhaust plume of the three main engines. The exhaust gas (H 2O) flowing from the engines reaches the speed of Mach 10, and the increase in pressure results in the shock diamonds."
What occurs in the diverging section of a nozzle when exhaust gas travels at supersonic velocities?," Lower values of pressure than that of the ambient pressure ( p0)c a nb er e a c h e di n the diverging portion of a nozzle, where the exhaust gas flows at supersonic speed. The higher ambient pressure cannot advance upstream of the nozzle, because the gas flows at supersonic speed. However, along the nozzle walls, due to the friction, there may be a boundary layer of gas moving at low speeds."
What condition allows ambient pressure to advance upstream within the boundary layer for this rocket engine scenario?," Within this boundary layer, the gas moves at subsonic speeds, and therefore the ambient pressure can advance upstream for a distance. Therefore, the low-pressure central flow is forced away from the nozzle walls. The following example shows a calculation relating to an ideal liquid-propellant rocket engine."
What is the total temperature in the combustion chamber given that Ti and Mi are the flow temperature and Mach number at the nozzle inlet?," The following data are known (from [ 4]): propellant mass flow rate in the combustion chamber . mtc=163.6k g /s, total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet ( pc)ns=pi[1+ 1/2 ( gamma - 1)M2 i] gamma / gamma - 1=6.895 ×106 N/m2,t o t a lt e m p e r a t u r eo ft h ec o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e r( Tc)ns=Ti[1+ 1/2 ( gamma - 1)M2 i] =3633 K ( TiandMibeing respectively the flow temperature and the Mach number at the nozzle inlet), molar mass of the combustion products M=22."
What is the expansion area ratio of the nozzle given the specific heat ratio and molecular weight of the gas?,"67 kg/kmol, speci fic heat ratio of the combusted gas gamma =1.20, and expansion area ratio of the nozzle Ae/At=12. The Mach number Minjat the injection plane is assumed to be equal to zero, and the Mach number Miat the inlet plane of the nozzle is assumed to be equal to 0.4. In practice, the design values used for Mirange from 0."

We want to compute the static pressures pinj,pt,px(at a cross-section xof area Ax= 4At), and peof the gas.

What are the products formed when hydrazine decomposes in the presence of a catalyst in a mono-propellant engine?," In a mono-propellant engine, hydrazine decomposes (in the presence of a catalyst such as iridium metal supported by high-surface-area alumina, or carbon nano fibres, or molybdenum nitride on alumina) into gaseous nitrogen (N 2)a n dg a s e o u sh y d r o g e n( H 2), or into ammonia (NH 3)a n dg a s e o u sn i t r o g e n( N 2), according to the following exothermic reactions [21]: H2NNH 2→N2+2H2 3H2NNH 2→4NH 3+N2 As c h e m ei l l u s t r a t i n gam o n o - p r o p e l l a n tr o c k e te n g i n ef e db yh y d r a z i n ei ss h o w n in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]."
What type of valve regulates the flow of hydrazine in the mono-propellant engine?," 1.4 Liquid Propellants for High-Thrust Rocket Engines 41 With reference to the preceding figure, the working principle of a hydrazine mono- propellant engine can be described as follows. An electric solenoid valve, placed between the hydrazine tank and the thrust chamber, opens in order to allow liquid hydrazine, in a pulsed or continuous flow, to reach the injector."
What effect does the catalyst bed have on the liquid hydrazine in the thrust chamber?," This hydrazine enters the thrust chamber as a spray and gets in touch with the catalyst bed. This bed consists of alumina (Al 2O3)p e l l e t si m p r e g n a t e dw i t hi r i d i u m .T h ec a t a l y s tb e da n d the hot gases leaving the catalyst particles cause the liquid hydrazine to vaporise, and its temperature to rise to a point where the chemical reaction of dissociation is self-sustaining."
What specific impulse range do mono-propellant hydrazine engines achieve?," Then, the gases resulting from hydrazine decomposition leave the catalyst bed and exit from the chamber through a nozzle of high expansion ratio to produce thrust. Mono-propellant hydrazine engines produce a speci fic impulse of about 230– 240 s. Mono-propellant engines using hydrogen peroxide and nitrous oxide have a lower performance than that obtained with hydrazine, since their speci fic impulses are respectively about 150 and 170 s [ 10]."
What are some examples of fuels that can be used in green propellants?," Since hydrazine is corrosive, highly toxic and carcinogenic, and is also dangerous to handle and store, then new substances, called green propellants, are being studied and tested for its replacement. A green propellant is an aqueous solution of a high- energy oxidiser (such as hydroxyl ammonium nitrate, ammonium dinitramide, and others) and a fuel (such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and others)."
What is the chemical formula of hydroxyl ammonium nitrate?," Hydroxyl ammo- nium nitrate, also known as HAN, whose chemical formula is NH 3OHNO 3,i sas a l t derived from hydroxyl amine (NH 2OH) and nitric acid (HNO 3), which can be used as a solution in mono-propellants, or also as a solid oxidiser in bi-propellants. The Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA, has developed a hydroxyl ammonium nitrate-based propellant known as AF-M315E."
"What is the specific impulse of the propellant mentioned, and how does it compare to that of hydrazine?"," This propellant is less toxic and easier to handle than hydrazine, and has a speci fic 42 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines impulse Is=257 s, which is about 12% greater than the speci fic impulse of hydrazine, the latter being Is=230 s. It requires a catalyst bed preheating at a temperature exceeding 558 K to be ready for general operation [ 23]."
What is the chemical formula of ammonium dinitramide?," It requires ac a t a l y s tb e dp r e h e a t i n ga tat e m p e r a t u r ee x c e e d i n g5 5 8Kt ob er e a d yf o rg e n e r a l operation [ 19]. Ammonium dinitramide, also known as ADN, whose chemical formula is NH 4N(NO 2)2,i st h ea m m o n i u m( N H 4+)s a l to ft h ed i n i t r a m i n i ca c i d( H N ( N O 2)2), and was invented in the 1970s in the former Soviet Union and independently 236 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure invented again in 1989 in the United States by SRI International."
What are the primary products formed from the decomposition of ammonium dinitramide when subjected to heat?," Gaseous ammonium dinitramide decomposes under heat into ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2O), and nitric acid (HNO 3), according to the following two-branch reaction [ 24]: NH 4N(NO 2)2→NH 3+HN(NO 2)2 →NH 3+N2O+HNO 3 The Swedish company EURENCO Bofors produces a liquid mono-propellant, called LMP-103S, as a substitute for hydrazine by dissolving 65% ammonium dinitramide in 35% water solution of methanol (CH 3OH) and ammonia (NH 3)."
What advantages do rocket engines using mono-propellants have compared to those using multiple propellants?," LMP-103S has 6% higher speci fic impulse and 30% higher impulse density (see below) than hydrazine mono-propellant [ 25]. LMP-103S has been tested on the PRISMA (Prototype Research Instruments and Space Mission technology Advance- ment, COSPAR designation 2010-028B and 2010-028F) mission in 2010. Rocket engines using mono-propellants are simple, require only one tank for the propellant, and can be readily turned on and off."
What are the primary purposes of the substances that are kept in separate tanks for rocket engines?," They are mainly used to perform such functions as orbit maintenance and attitude control of satellites. Al i q u i db i - p r o p e l l a n tc o m p r i s e st w os u b s t a n c e s ,n a m e l yaf u e la n da no x i d i s e r , which are held in separate tanks. They are not mixed before being injected into the combustion chamber of a rocket engine."
How does liquid fuel in a pump-fed engine transition before driving a turbine?," They may be fed to the combustion chamber either by pumps or by pressure in the tanks, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]. In a pump-fed engine (left), the liquid fuel (H 2)p i c k s up heat, as it circulates through the coolant jacket of the thrust chamber, becomes gaseous, and drives a turbine."
What are the two components used for control in the expander cycle?," The gas exhausted by the turbine is then injected into the combustion chamber. This arrangement is called the expander cycle. Control in this cycle is achieved by using: (a) the turbine valve to regulate the thrust, and (b) the mixture valve to maintain the desired mixture ratio. In a pressure-fed engine (right), the pressure in the propellant tanks is suf ficient to force the two propellants (H 2and O2)t h r o u g ht h ei n j e c t o ri n t ot h ec o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e r ."
What is the advantage of bi-propellants over mono-propellants in rocket engines?,"T h ef u e l( H 2) first circulates through the coolant jacket, and is then delivered to the combustion chamber. In a pressure-fed engine, the pressures in the supply tanks can be regulated to yield the desired pressure and mixture ratio in the combustion chamber [ 26]. 1.4 Liquid Propellants for High-Thrust Rocket Engines 43 Liquid-propellant rocket engines using bi-propellants have higher performance than those using mono-propellants, as shown in the general table of Sect."
What factors make certain propellants easier to operate than others in relation to hydrazine?," 1.3.I na d d i - tion, the former are often easier to operate than the latter, particularly in consideration of the risks connected with the use of hydrazine. When the fuel and the oxidiser react spontaneously, as is the case with the hyper- golic substances described in Sect. 1.2,t h e nn oi g n i t i o nd e v i c ei sn e e d e di nal i q u i d - propellant engine."
What is the primary function of a spark plug igniter in a bi-propellant rocket engine?," Otherwise, an ignition device is necessary in the combustion chamber of a bi-propellant rocket engine. Some of these devices are brie fly described below. One of them is a spark plug igniter. A spark plug igniter is a small combus- tion chamber having two spark plugs. It provides the flame to ignite the propellant (fuel and oxidiser) in the main thrust chamber."
What initiates the ignition process in the main combustion chamber after the spark plugs are energized?," When the engine is started, the spark exciters energise the spark plugs as the oxidiser and the fuel flow to the spark igniter. As the gaseous oxidiser and fuel enter this small combustion chamber, they mix and are touched off by an electrical spark. The pilot flame provided by the spark igniter lights off the main combustion chamber."
What is the specific type of spark plug igniter used in the Rocketdyne J-2 rocket engine?," A spark plug igniter is capable of multiple re-ignitions. The Rocketdyne J-2 rocket engine had a particular spark plug igniter unit, called augmented spark igniter or spark torch igniter, which formed an integral part of the thrust chamber injector, as shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of the United States Air Force [ 27]."
What type of igniter was used in the main engines of the Space Shuttle?," 44 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines The J-2 rocket engine was used for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles for the NASA Apollo programme. The main engines of the Space Shuttle also had an augmented spark igniter, whose chamber was located in the centre of the injector."
What was the purpose of the dual-redundant igniter in the engine start sequence?," The dual-redundant igniter was used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters were turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining [ 28]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of the United States Air Force [ 27], shows the position of the augmented spark igniter in the J-2 rocket engine."
What component generates heat in a pyrotechnic igniter used for high-thrust rocket engines?," 1.4 Liquid Propellants for High-Thrust Rocket Engines 45 Another ignition device is a pyrotechnic igniter, which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 29]. Ap y r o t e c h n i ci g n i t e ri ss e to f fb ya ne l e c t r i cc u r r e n t ,w h i c hh e a t sab r i d g ew i r e enclosed in a clump of easily ignited materials."
What components typically make up the materials that generate sparks and hot gases when ignited?," Each of these materials, in turn, comprises an oxidiser (usually potassium perchlorate or potassium nitrate) and a fuel (usually titanium, or titanium hydride, or zirconium, or zirconium hydride, or boron). Such materials, when ignited by the hot wire, generate sparks and hot gases due to the chemical reaction between the oxidiser and the fuel."
What type of fluid is injected ahead of liquid propellants for ignition purposes?," These, in turn, ignite the mixture of gaseous propellant in the combustion chamber. Pyrotechnic igniters are safe and reliable. They are one-shot devices, and therefore cannot be used to re-start a rocket engine [ 30]. Still another ignition method used for liquid propellants consists in injecting some spontaneously ignitable fluid, called a pyrophoric fluid, ahead of the propellant."
"What types of substances can ignite spontaneously upon exposure to air, moisture, or water?"," Pyrophoric substances (for example, ferrous sulphide and many reactive metals) have the property of igniting spontaneously, that is, without an external source of heat, upon exposure to air, moisture in the air, oxygen, or water. Such substances may be solid, liquid, or gaseous. Most of them are metals and react spontaneously with oxygen only when they are in a very finely divided state."
What is the oxidising agent for pyrophoric substances?," Pyrophoric substances are a special class of hypergolic substances (described in Sect. 1.2), because the oxidising agent for the former class is restricted to atmospheric oxygen [ 31]. They can be handled safely in atmospheres of argon or, with a few exceptions, nitrogen. A list of pyrophoric materials can be found in [ 32]."
What are the three methods of igniting liquid propellants mentioned?," These three methods of ignition (electric spark, chemical injection, and pyrotechnic) are shown together in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 33]. 46 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines Finally, liquid propellants can also be ignited by using a small combustor, wherein pyrotechnic devices or electric spark plugs ignite the propellant."
What is the primary focus of cryogenics according to NASA's definition?," The hot gas produced, in turn, ignites the propellant in the main combustion chamber. Fundamental concepts on cryogenic propellants have been given in Sect. 1.2.T h e scope of cryogenics has been de fined by NASA ([ 34], page 1) as follows: “Cryogenics is the discipline that involves the properties and use of materials at extremely low temperatures; it includes the production, storage, and use of cryogenic fluids."
At what temperature do most researchers classify a gas as cryogenic based on its ability to be liquefied?," A gas is considered to be cryogenic if it can be changed to a liquid by the removal of heat and by subsequent temperature reduction to a very low value. The temperature range that is of interest in cryogenics is not de fined precisely; however, most researchers consider a gas to be cryogenic if it can be lique fied at or below - 240 °F."
What temperature is required to liquefy gases classified as cryogenic propellants?," The most common cryogenic fluids are air, argon, helium, hydrogen, methane, neon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Other gases that are being used in space probes and high-energy liquid- propellant rockets include fluorine and nitrogen tri fluoride.”. In accordance with the preceding de finition, by cryogenic propellants we mean gases which can be lique fied at or below 122 K."
What are the primary cryogenic propellants used in rocket applications?," The most common cryogenic propellants for rocket applications are liquid oxygen (O 2), liquid hydrogen (H 2), liquid fluorine (F 2), and oxygen di fluoride (OF 2), or mixtures of some of these substances. These propellants should be stored and handled in such a way as to reduce the increase in their temperature of storage to a minimum."
What factors influence the temperature of a propellant during storage?," This temperature depends on the particular propellant and also on the time of storage. The thermal insulation techniques used for reservoirs should reduce the increase in temperature. The gases developed from the evaporating liquids should have a venting system, in order to allow them to escape. Accurate control should be exerted on the environmental humidity."
What advantages do storable liquid propellants have compared to cryogenic liquid propellants regarding temperature and pressure stability?," In addition, the design adopted and the materials selected for rocket engines using cryogenic propellants should take account of the properties of such propellants. These disadvantages are offset by high values of speci fic impulse, as has been shown in Sect. 1.2. In contrast with cryogenic liquid propellants, storable liquid propellants are stable over a wide range of temperature and pressure, and are also scarcely reactive with the materials used for their reservoirs."
What is an example of a liquid storable fuel used in military and space vehicles?," Therefore, they can be stored for periods of 1.4 Liquid Propellants for High-Thrust Rocket Engines 47 ay e a ro rm o r e .T h e s ep r o p e r t i e sm a k et h e mr e a d i l ya v a i l a b l ea n dr e l i a b l e .T h e ya r e used in military vehicles and in upper stages of space vehicles. For example, a liquid storable fuel is Aerozine 50 (see Sect."
What is the weight mixture ratio of hydrazine to unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine in Aerozine 50?," 1.2), which is a 50/50 mixture by weight of hydrazine (H 2NNH 2)a n du n s y m m e t r i c a ld i m e t h y lh y d r a z i n e (H2NN(CH 3)2). Aerozine 50 is used with nitrogen tetroxide (N 2O4)a st h eo x i d i s e r , with which it is hypergolic. This combination of fuel and oxidiser is storable at room temperature, and therefore a loaded missile can be stored for several years without the maintenance requirements associated with cryogenic propellants."
What fuel was created in the 1950s for Titan II ICBM rocket engines and is used for spacecraft propulsion?," This fuel was developed in 1950s by Aerojet General Corporation for the Titan II ICBM rocket engines, and has been used in Aerojet’s Titan liquid rocket engine [ 35]a n d Delta II stage 2 engine [ 36]. Aerozine 50 is mainly used for interplanetary probes and spacecraft propulsion, and is also used for intercontinental ballistic missiles, which require long-term storage and launch on short notice."
What percentage of the mixture UH2 4 is composed of unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine?," Another liquid storable fuel, also used with nitrogen tetroxide (N 2O4)a st h eo x i d i s e r ,i sU H2 4 ,w h i c h is a mixture of 75% unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H 2NN(CH 3)2)a n d2 5 % hydrazine hydrate (H 2NNH 2·H2O). This combination is also hypergolic, and has been used in the Ariane rocket versions 2 through 4 [ 37], and also in the Indian Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III [ 38]."
What are the purposes of additive substances mixed with liquid propellants?," The liquid propellants indicated above are sometimes mixed with additive substances, which are meant to either facilitate ignition, or stabilise combustion, or reduce corrosive effects, or lower freezing point, or improve cooling properties of propellants. Some attempts have been made to promote hypergolicity in propellants by adding substances in the cryogenic oxidiser or in the fuel."
What is the reason given by Dickinson for not using hypergolic additives in fuels?," An account on these attempts has been given by Clark [ 39]. In particular, it has been proposed to add aluminium tri-ethyl (Al 2(C2H5)6)t ot h e fuel, or ozone fluoride (O 3F2)t ot h eo x i d i s e r .A c c o r d i n gt oD i c k i n s o n[ 40], using hypergolic additives to fuels is not a good practice, because it increases the danger of inadvertent ignition on exposure of the fuel to air."
What are the potential complications of injecting additives as a secondary stream in rocket engine design?," The additive might be injected as a secondary stream in the fuel ahead of the combustion chamber, but this would imply an added complication in the design of a rocket engine. It seems better to mix additives to the oxidiser, because the danger is con fined to direct mixing of fluid with oxidiser, or to direct spilling of the oxidiser on combustible materials."
What is the difference between the stoichiometric mixture ratio and the optimum mixture ratio in rocket engines?," As has been shown in Sect. 1.2, there is a mixture ratio ( o/f), called the stoichio- metric mixture ratio, between the oxidiser ( o)a n dt h ef u e l( f). The stoichiometric mixture ratio for a rocket engine is the ideal ratio of oxidiser to fuel that burns all fuel with no excess oxidiser. In practice, there is another mixture ratio, called the optimum mixture ratio, between the oxidiser and the fuel which leads to the maximum value of performance."
What happens to the temperature of the flame when the fuel quantity exceeds the stoichiometric mixture ratio?," The optimum mixture ratio is less than the stoichiometric mixture ratio, because the temperature of the flame reaches its maximum value when the quantity of fuel exceeds the value de fined by the stoichiometric mixture ratio. This happens because a combustion richer in fuel generates an exhaust gas having a lower molar mass."
What factors may cause the chosen mixture ratio to differ from its optimum value in a combustion chamber?," The optimum mixture ratio varies slightly with the pressure in the combustion chamber. In practice, the actual value chosen for the mixture ratio may differ from the optimum value, because the temperature of the combustion chamber must be 48 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines kept within the limits imposed by the materials, or because of the coolant flow, or because the combustion must be made stable."
How does propellant density impact rocket engine design and mass requirements?," The performance of a liquid propellant depends not only on its speci fic impulse, Is, but also on its density, because a low-density propellant implies large storage tanks, which in turn imply a high mass of a rocket engine. By contrast, a high-density propellant can be stored in small tanks and requires small pumps to be fed to the combustion chamber."
What is the formula for calculating impulse density using average specific gravity and total specific gravities of the oxidiser and fuel?," This indicator of performance of a propellant combination is taken into account by means of the so-called impulse density, Id,w h i c hi sd e fi n e d as follows [ 6]: Id=Isδav where δavis a dimensionless quantity, called average speci fic gravity of a propellant combination (oxidiser and fuel), de fined as follows δav=δoδf(1+r) rδf+δo r equivalent o/fis the oxidiser-to-fuel weight mixture ratio, δois the speci fic gravity (ratio of the density of a given substance to the density of water at 277 K and atmospheric pressure) of the oxidiser, and δfis the speci fic gravity of the fuel."
What measurement unit is used for impulse density in propellant combinations?," Since δavis a dimensionless quantity, then the impulse density, Id,o fap r o p e l l a n tc o m b i n a t i o n is measured in seconds, as is the case with the speci fic impulse, Is.S p e c i fi cg r a v i - ties of various propellants as a function of temperature are given in [ 6], page 243. Values of IsandIdfor various propellants are given in [ 4], pages 25, 26, and 27."
What pages contain further performance data related to liquid hydrocarbons and aluminium-hydrocarbon fuels?," Further performance data, in terms of IsandId,c o n c e r n i n gl i q u i dh y d r o c a r b o n sa n d aluminium-hydrocarbon fuels, are given in [ 41], pages 5, 6, and 8. Ap r o p e l l a n tc o m b i n a t i o nf o ras p e c i fi ca p p l i c a t i o ni sc h o s e nt a k i n gi n t oa c c o u n t the advantages and the disadvantages of each combination."
What aspects should be considered for effective propellant selection according to Huzel and Huang?," It is often necessary to adopt a compromise. Some criteria to be considered in a choice have been identi fied by Huzel and Huang [ 4]. They are: •high release of energy per unit mass of propellant, combined with low molar mass of the gases resulting from combustion or decomposition, in order to have high values of speci fic impulse; •easiness of igniting the propellant; •stability of combustion; •high density of the propellant or high impulse density, in order to reduce the volume and the weight of the tanks and the pumps; •capability possessed by the propellant of cooling effectively the thrust chamber; •low vapour pressure of the propellant a temperature of about 344 K, for low weight of tanks and pumps; •low freezing point of the propellant, possibly less than 219 K, for easy engine operation at low temperatures; 1."
What are the desirable properties of liquid propellants for efficient operation in high-thrust rocket engines?,"4 Liquid Propellants for High-Thrust Rocket Engines 49 •absence of corrosiveness and compatibility of the propellant with the materials used for the engine; •high boiling point, possibly above 344 K, for storable propellants; •low viscosity, possibly less than 0.01 Ns/m2,t or e d u c ep r e s s u r ed r o p st h r o u g ht h e feed system and the injector; •high thermal and shock stability, to reduce risks of explosion and fire; •low toxicity of the propellant itself and its reaction products; •low cost; and •ready availability."
What is the role of the distributing manifold in a liquid-propellant rocket engine's combustion process?, 1.5 Combustion of Propellants in Steady State The combustion process which occurs in steady-state conditions in a liquid-propellant rocket engine can be described by the following sequence of events. The propellants are injected from a distributing manifold into the combustion chamber of the engine through ori fices.
How are the jets in a combustion chamber made to break into small droplets?," The propellants are in the form of liquid jets. These jets are made to break up into small droplets, which then vaporise at high temperature in the combustion chamber. The breakup of the jets is often achieved by causing two or three of like (or sometimes unlike) substances to impinge. The impinging jets produce thin liquid sheets or fans which disintegrate rapidly."
What occurs in the combustion chamber of bi-propellant engines when fuel and oxidizer vapors mix?," In bi- propellant engines, the reactive vapours containing fuel and oxidiser get mixed one with the other. The mixed vapours interact, and the hot gases resulting from the combustion process flow out of the combustion chamber toward the throat of the nozzle. Due to various reasons, the actual combustion process in steady state may be more complex than the ideal process described above, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 42]."
What is the effect achieved by designing certain areas within injectors to alter the flow of liquid propellants before combustion?," Ar e a s o ni st h ei n t e r n a ls h a p eo fs o m ei n j e c t o r s ,w h i c ha r ed e s i g n e ds ot h a tt h e liquid propellants flowing through them are partially or totally mixed, or broken up into droplets, or vaporised before entering the combustion chamber. This effect can also be obtained by injecting controlled streams of gases into the injector passages, or by using other means."
What type of reactions occurs in the absence of mixing within the liquid phase with certain hypergolic propellants?," Another reason is the occurrence of combustion reactions in condensed phase with certain propellants, before their mixture or vaporisation. Still another reason is the occurrence of heterogeneous reactions in the absence of mixing in liquid phase, as is the case with some combinations of hypergolic propellants."
What causes incomplete mixtures of fuel and oxidizer in the gaseous phase within combustion chambers?," Still another reason is an incomplete mixture of fuel with oxidiser in gaseous phase. This happens near the walls of the combustion chamber, where fuel-rich streams are intentionally sprayed for purposes of cooling. This also happens because of condensed phases which may be present in the mixture of the combustion products, when the propellants used contain either metals or carbon."
What impact does the recirculation of combustion products near the injector plate have on gas retention in the combustion chamber?," This also happens because part of combustion products may recirculate back to the vicinity of the injector plate 50 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines between spray fans, instead of going directly toward the nozzle, thereby causing a fraction of gas to remain in the combustion chamber for a long time."
What effect does exceeding the critical pressure level in the combustion chamber have on the distinction between liquid and gas phases of propellants?," Still another reason is the pressure level in the combustion chamber, which may increase above the critical point of one or both of the propellants, thereby causing the sharp distinction between liquid and gas to disappear. Due to one or more of these reasons, the actual combustion process may differ from the simple process indicated above."
How are the segments within a cylindrical combustion chamber oriented in relation to the injection plane and the nozzle?," Analytical models of the combustion phenomena are described at length in [ 42,43]. The phenomena which occur in a combustion chamber of cylindrical shape can be described by dividing the combustion chamber into a series of adjacent cylindrical 1.5 Combustion of Propellants in Steady State 51 segments, stacked onto one another in the axial direction from the injection plane to the inlet plane of the nozzle."
"What factors influence the thickness, phenomena, and surface shape of segments in a propulsion system?"," The thickness of each segment, the phenomena which actually occur into it, and the shape of its surfaces of separation from the adjacent segments depend on factors such as the speci fic combination of propellants used, the operating conditions (pressure, temperature, mixture ratio, et c.), and the type of injectors."
What state does liquid hydrogen become before its injection in a rocket engine combustion chamber?," The surfaces which separate two adjacent cylindrical segments are not planar, but have undulations which vary with time. The combustion phenomena in a rocket engine depend on the combination of propellants used. For example, when the fuel is liquid hydrogen which has been used, before injection, to cool the walls of the combustion chamber, then this fuel is in the gaseous state at a temperature varying from 60 to 500 K [ 6]."
What precautions should designers take to prevent explosions in hypergolic propellant conditions?," In such conditions, there are neither droplets of liquid hydrogen nor evaporation. When the liquid propellants used are hypergolic, then an initial chemical reaction occurs in liquid phase at the moment in which a droplet of fuel impinges on a droplet of oxidiser. Therefore, care must be taken by the designer to avoid local explosions and excessive releases of energy which could generate shock waves."
What is the name of the cylindrical segment next to the injector plate where liquid propellants enter?," The cylindrical segment immediately adjacent to the injector plate is known as the injection-and-breakup zone, where two different liquid propellants enter through the ori fices of the injector. This happens with either storable propellants or combinations of liquid oxygen with hydrocarbons. The injection velocities range from about 7 to 60 m/s [ 6]."
How do injector characteristics affect combustion stability in specific zones?," The type of injector used (including the pattern, the size, the number, and the distribution of the ori fices) has a strong in fluence on the behaviour and in particular on the stability of the combustion in this zone. The same in fluence have the pressure drop, the con figuration of the manifold, or the roughness of the walls of the injection ducts."
What mechanisms cause propellant jets to form droplets in the specified zone?," In this zone, the individual jets or streams of propellants break up into droplets by impingement of one jet with another or with a surface, or by inherent instability of liquid sprays, or by interactions of liquids with gases having different velocities and temperatures. These droplets are heated by radiation coming from the next zone (called rapid combustion zone) and also by convection of gas in the injection-and-breakup zone."
What causes the formation of regions rich in fuel or oxidiser vapour during the evaporation process?," This heat causes the droplets to evaporate and create regions rich in either fuel vapour or oxidiser vapour. The injection-and-breakup zone is heterogeneous, because it contains liquid propellants, vaporised propellants, and hot gases resulting from combustion products. Since the propellants in liquid phase are located at discrete places, then large variations are present in mass flow rates, mixture ratios, sizes and distributions of droplets, and properties of resulting gases."
What occurs differently in the injection-and-breakup zone when one propellant is in the gaseous state?," The chemical reactions occurring in the injection-and-breakup zone generate heat at low rates, and hot gases may recirculate back to the injector plate. Such gases create vortices and turbulent motions which contribute to the initial evaporation of the liquids injected. The processes described above occur in a different manner when one of the propellants is in the gaseous state."
What is the injection velocity threshold of gaseous hydrogen as mentioned in the text?," Such is the case with gaseous hydrogen coming in contact with liquid oxygen. Gaseous hydrogen has no droplets and does not evaporate. Since the injection velocity of gaseous hydrogen is much higher (above 120 m/s, according to [ 6]) than that of liquid oxygen, then shear forces act on the liquid jets, and such forces foster the formation and the evaporation of droplets."
What distinguishes the injector type required for this case from those used for two propellants entering in liquid form?," This case requires the use of an injector of a particular type, which differs 52 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines from the injectors used for two propellants entering the combustion chamber in the liquid state. To this regard, the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 42], shows an injector assembly of coaxial-tube injection elements like that used in the J-2 rocket engine."
What is the term for the cylindrical sector adjacent to the injection-and-breakup area in the nozzle?," In this assembly, which is typical of an O 2/H2concentric ori fice injector, the oxygen tubes are recessed and hydrogen enters the injection elements through inlet holes or slots in their sleeves. The cylindrical sector contiguous to the injection-and-breakup zone in the direc- tion of the nozzle is called rapid combustion zone."
What occurs to fuel-rich and fuel-lean gases as oxidation happens in the described zone?," In this zone, rapid and intense chemical reactions occur at increasing high temperatures. Droplets of propellants which may be left are vaporised by convective heat. Consequently, fuel-rich and fuel-lean gases are mixed. The oxidation of the fuel occurs rapidly in this zone, and generates heat at higher rates than those of the preceding zone, with consequent decrease in density and increase in velocity of the burning gas."
What is the name of the cylindrical sector adjacent to the rapid combustion area in the axial direction?, The chemical compo- sition and the mixture ratio become more uniform as the burning gas moves through this zone. The axial component of the velocity vector of a molecule of combusted gas moving along a stream line becomes gradually greater than its transverse component. The cylindrical sector contiguous to the rapid combustion zone in the axial direc- tion is called stream tube combustion zone.
What happens to the rate of oxidation reactions compared to the previous zone?," In this zone, oxidation reactions continue to occur, but at a lower rate than that of the previous zone. The gas mixture approaches an equilibrium composition. The axial component of the velocity vector (ranging from 200 to 600 m/s, according to [ 6]) of a gas molecule is much higher than its transverse component, and therefore there is little turbulent mixing between gaseous layers."
How does the residence time of a gaseous molecule in the stream tube combustion zone compare to its residence time in previous zones?," The residence time of a gaseous molecule in the stream tube combustion zone is little in comparison with its residence time in the previous zones. The shape of the 1.5 Combustion of Propellants in Steady State 53 stream lines, the inviscid flow, and the tendency of the combustion products toward chemical equilibrium persist in the stream tube combustion zone."
What characterizes the flame front in a combustion chamber?," The burning process which actually takes place in a combustion chamber is to be considered as a series of events which occur rather simultaneously than sequentially. Due to turbulence phenomena occurring in various degrees in all of the three zones indicated above, the flame front in a combustion chamber is not a planar surface."
What is the typical duration for single molecules of reactants in a liquid-propellant rocket engine's combustion chamber?," The time spent by single molecules of reactants or combustion products in the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant rocket engine is of the order of magnitude of 10 ms. The heat release per unit volume is about 3.7 ×105J/m3,w h i c hv a l u ei s much higher than in a turbojet. In addition, the higher temperatures reached in the combustion chamber of a rocket engine cause chemical reactions to occur at much higher rates than in a turbojet [ 6]."
What conditions are typically aimed for in the design of liquid-propellant rocket engines during operation?," 1.6 Combustion of Propellants in Unsteady State Transients can be induced in the process of combustion either intentionally, as is the case with engine start-up or shut-down, or because of the insurgence of undesired phenomena of instability. As will be shown at length in Chap. 2,t h ec o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e ro fal i q u i d - propellant rocket engine is normally designed to operate in steady state or in condi- tions which vary slowly with time."
What is the range of frequencies measured in the combustion chamber when unstable behavior occurs?," However, an unstable behaviour may occur there as a result of small perturbations, which cause self-sustaining oscillations of pres- sure in the burning gas. The frequencies of these oscillations vary in a wide range. Speci fically, frequencies going from less than 100 Hz to over 15,000 Hz have been measured in the combustion chamber at amplitudes going from 10 to 1000% of the pressure in steady state [ 42]."
What potential issues can occur due to oscillating pressure in the combustion chamber?," According to Culick and Kuentzmann [ 43], the energy taken by these oscillations is only a small part of the chemical energy made available by the propellants. There- fore, except in very severe instances, the mean thrust or the steady power of the engine is not affected by the oscillations. However, serious problems may arise because of structural vibrations excited by the oscillating pressure in the combustion chamber, and also because of oscillations of the thrust generated by the engine."
What results from the interaction of the combustion process with the structural modes of a rocket vehicle?," In addition, the heat transfer rates between the hot gas and the internal surface of the combustion chamber can be highly increased, with consequent erosion of the chamber wall. The unstable motion of the hot gas is self-excited as a result of an interaction of the combustion process with the structural modes of the rocket vehicle."
What example illustrates self-sustained oscillations due to instability from propellant chemical energy?," This instability arises because a very small part of the chemical energy contained in the propellants is suf ficient to produce large unsteady motions, and also because the processes tending to attenuate such motions are weak, unless appropriate steps are taken. An example of these self-sustained oscillations is provided by the so-called pogo instability (see Chap."
What type of instability arises from feedback interactions between a propulsion system and a rocket stage's structure during the first stage's operation?," 2,S e c t .2 . 9 ,a n dC h a p . 7,S e c t .7 . 6 ) ,w h i c ho c c u r si nt h ef e e d lines of large liquid-propellant rocket vehicles, such as space launch vehicles or ballistic missiles. This particular instability is due to a feedback interaction between 54 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines the propulsion system and the structure of a rocket stage, and occurs principally in the first longitudinal mode of the structure of the vehicle during operation of its first stage."
What frequency range characterizes the most destructive type of combustion instability known as acoustic instability?," The most destructive type of combustion instability is characterised by oscillations of high frequency, and is also known as acoustic instability. The frequencies of these oscillations are equal to or greater than 1000 Hz [ 4]. The term acoustic instability is due to an observed correspondence, in both frequency and phase, between the pressure oscillations observed experimentally in ac o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e ra n dt h eo s c i l l a t i o n sc a l c u l a t e df o rt h ea c o u s t i cr e s o n a n c eo f the chamber."
What type of energy source is needed to maintain high-frequency instability in rocket engines?," High-frequency instability includes both longitudinal and transverse modes, and the latter include, in turn, radial and tangential modes. In general terms, a source of oscillating energy is necessary to sustain instability. In the particular case of high-frequency instability, the source of oscillating energy is the combustion of the propellants used in a rocket engine, and depends weakly on the feed system of the engine."
What mechanisms have been suggested to maintain high-frequency instability beyond ignition loss?," The oscillating energy must, to sustain instability, be properly phased in time with the oscillating pressure, as will be shown at length in Chap. 2,S e c t .2 . 9 . Sustaining mechanisms which have been proposed for high-frequency instability include loss of ignition, sensitive chemical preparation time, physical time delays, detonation processes, pressure or temperature sensitive chemical kinetics, the burst of droplets heated beyond their critical temperature and pressure, and the shattering and mixing of the streams, fans, or drops by the motion of gas particles [ 42]."
What characterizes a rocket engine that can manage significant disturbances and still maintain steady operational conditions?," Instability in a combustion chamber may start either spontaneously or as a result of some arti ficial perturbation. Acoustic instability may have a threshold amplitude, above which a perturbation is sustained and below which the same perturbation is damped. A rocket engine is said to be inherently stable, when it can absorb large perturbations and yet return to its operation in steady state."
What factors contribute to the inherent stability measurement of a rocket engine?," The degree of inherent stability of a rocket engine can be measured by rating devices which provide arti ficial perturbations to its combustion chamber. Such perturbations involve operating condi- tions, such as mixture ratio of the propellants, pressure in the combustion chamber, temperature of the fuel, and so on."
What type of instability does not need an initial disturbance and arises from the natural noise in the combustion process?," An instability of the spontaneous type requires no initial perturbation to start, and grows out of the noise inherent to the combustion process. An instability of this type can be expected to occur just after an engine has reached its normal oper- ating conditions, because no perturbation is required for its occurrence."
What terms are used to describe significant overpressure events in a combustion chamber during ignition or spontaneous operation?," Variations in test conditions and the closeness to a stability boundary may sometimes delay the occurrence of a spontaneous instability. Instability in a combustion chamber may also be induced by natural or arti ficial perturbations which may occur in the combustion process. Such perturbations are also known as spikes or pops, where a spike indicates a signi ficant overpressure in the combustion chamber upon ignition of the engine, and a pop indicates a similar overpressure occurring spontaneously during engine operation at nominal pressure in the combustion chamber."
What phenomenon occurs in the combustion chamber of hypergolic bi-propellants at high altitudes during ignition?," For example, at high altitudes, some combinations of hypergolic bi-propellants may start with an extremely high spike of pressure in the combustion chamber. This spike has been attributed to the explosion or de flagration 1.6 Combustion of Propellants in Unsteady State 55 of the propellants collected in the combustion chamber or accumulated on its walls during the period of ignition delay."
What are the potential consequences of a pressure spike in a combustion chamber?," This spike of pressure may be of suf ficient magni- tude to either cause destructive failure in the combustion chamber or adversely affect the guidance sensor systems. In addition, for small rocket engines used for intermit- tent operation, the resultant thrust or the total impulse is seriously altered from that of a smooth start."
What can trigger resonance in the combustion process of large engines?," For large engines, the ignition spike can trigger resonance in the combustion process, with consequent hardware destruction [ 42]. In most cases, the combustion process in a rocket engine shows a non-linear behaviour, which requires some kind of trigger, be it natural or arti ficial, to cause pressure oscillations of high frequency and amplitude in the combustion chamber."
What should be evaluated to ensure engine stability during flight in response to potential triggers?," Consequently, it is necessary to determine the types and the magnitudes of the triggers which may occur in an engine during flight. This done, it is also necessary to evaluate the stability of that engine with arti ficial triggers of the assumed types. However, as has been shown above, a pressure oscillation may in some cases grow out of combustion noise, in the absence of any observable trigger."
What must a rocket engine do to achieve dynamic stability after experiencing transients during operation?," The dynamic stability of a rocket engine is concerned with the responses of the engine to transients occurring during its operation. A rocket engine must, to be dynamically stable, return to its normal operating conditions after transients of any type which may occur to it. In other words, in order for a rocket engine to be dynam- ically stable, the transients resulting from any type of operating conditions must die out, or the amplitudes of the subsequent sustained oscillations of pressure must be suf ficiently small."
How can the dynamic stability of a rocket engine be evaluated through pressure oscillations?," In order to evaluate the dynamic stability of a rocket engine, the engine is driven by any means into pressure oscillations of high amplitude. If these oscillations subsequently decay to those proper to steady-state conditions, then there is suf ficient assurance that no oscillations of high amplitude exist within the range of the given perturbations."
What method can be employed to increase assurance regarding a rocket engine's stability during actual flight?," A rocket engine, which has shown a dynamically stable behaviour within the range of the operating conditions expected in flight, should also remain stable in actual flight. Another method which may be used to gain con fidence in the stability of a rocket engine consists in conducting a large number of tests and flight."
What is the term for the confidence that indicates rare or nonexistent instability in tested operating conditions?," A con fidence gained in this way is called statistical stability. This con fidence indicates only that instability has rarely or never occurred in the operating condition tested, but not that instability can never occur. As will be shown at length in Chap. 2,S e c t .2 . 9 ,t h ep r o b l e mo fa s s u r i n gas t a b l e combustion in an existing rocket engine (without changing the dimensions of the combustion chamber, the hydraulic resistances of the propellant feed system, the type of injector, the heat flux in the combustion chamber, and the engine performance) can be solved by using baf fles, which are simple damping devices."
What type of injectors were initially paired with baf fles to address stability issues?," Baf fles can be mounted on existing injectors, in order to solve the stability problem with minimum effort and time. The early injectors had baf fles consisting of an even number of blades extending radially from a central hub. Later on, baf fles have been used in conjunction with injectors having larger ori fices in order to gain stability by modifying the combustion process [ 42]."
What methods have been employed to create artificial pressure changes in a rocket engine's combustion chamber?," Attempts made so far to induce arti ficial pressure perturbations in the combustion chamber of a rocket engine have used pulses of very short duration and suf ficient 56 1 Fundamental Concepts on Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines amplitude to excite the acoustic modes of the chamber. Sometimes, these pulses have been provided by explosive devices."
What is the primary function of the inert gas pulse technique in testing combustion stability?," Three types of techniques have been used to test the stability of combustion in a rocket engine. They are the inert gas (nitrogen or helium) pulse, the pulse gun, and the non-directional bomb. The first technique acts as a velocity perturbation to the combustion process, whereas the pulse gun and the non-directional bomb generate perturbations in both pressure and velocity by using explosives."
What type of gas pulse is effective in producing perturbations for engines using liquid oxygen and RP-1?," Therefore, the resulting perturbation is of the triggered (or induced) type. A gas pulse has been used in engines burning liquid oxygen and RP-1. For such engines, this technique has been found effective in producing perturbations triggering sustained instability. A gas pulse has also been used in engines burning nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozine 50 with negligible effects on the combustion."
What components are typically included in an arrangement that protects the explosive charge in an engine's combustion chamber?," Ap u l s eg u ni sad e v i c ew h i c hr e s e m b l e sag u n .I tc o n s i s t so fab r e e c hi n t ow h i c h an explosive charge is placed, usually in a cartridge case, a firing mechanism, a barrel, and often a diaphragm to protect the explosive charge from the environment of the combustion chamber of the engine."
What mechanism is responsible for initiating the firing process in a pulse gun?," The barrel of a pulse gun is usually attached to the wall of the combustion chamber of the engine, in order for the pulse to be fired in the tangential direction or in the radial direction. A pulse gun is acted upon by ac o m m a n dg i v e nt oi t s fi r i n gm e c h a n i s m ,w h i c hi su s u a l l yam e c h a n i c a ld e t o n a t o r acting on the main charge."
What is the maximum mass of high explosive that a pulse gun can contain?," The explosive charge of a pulse gun contains a mass of gun powder ranging from 194.4 to 259.2 mg, but may also contain a mass as high as 6480 mg of high explosive. A typical pulse gun is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 42]. An o n - d i r e c t i o n a lb o m bm o u n t e do nt h ew a l lo fac o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e ri ss h o w n in the following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 42]."
What are the three main components present in the described system involving combustion of propellants?," 1.6 Combustion of Propellants in Unsteady State 57 It consists of three principal parts, which are an explosive charge (for example, RDX), a detonator which may be commanded either by the rocket gases or by an electric signal, and a case which insulates the explosive charge and the detonator from the environment of the rocket engine and also contains the explosive charge."
What pressure perturbation range can pulse guns and non-directional bombs induce in the combustion chamber?," Unlike an inert gas pulse and a pulse gun, a non-directional bomb is usually mounted inside the combustion chamber and is not restricted to a location on the wall. Pulse guns and non-directional bombs can induce pressure perturbations ranging from 10 to 500% of the normal value in the combustion chamber."
What are the essential components of a liquid-propellant rocket engine listed in the information provided?," In the development of liquid-propellant rocket engines, non-directional bombs are the type of device most frequently used to induce pressure perturbations in the combustion chamber. 1.7 Principal Components of a Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engine Al i q u i d - p r o p e l l a n tr o c k e tv e h i c l ei sc o m p o s e do ft h ef o l l o w i n ge s s e n t i a lp a r t s : •propulsion system; •structure of the vehicle: •guidance system; •payload; and •accessories."

The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 45], shows the principal components of the F-1 engine, used in the first stage of the Saturn V."

"What is the publication year of ""Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines""?"," 1, Sect. 1.5.I ti ss u m m a r i s e db e l o wf o rc o n v e n i e n c eo ft h er e a d e r . ©T h eE d i t o r ( s )( i fa p p l i c a b l e )a n dT h eA u t h o r ( s ) ,u n d e re x c l u s i v el i c e n s e to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines , Springer Aerospace Technology, https://doi."
What is the range of injection velocity for fuel and oxidizer into the combustion chamber?,"org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_263 64 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly (1) Firstly, the fuel and the oxidiser are injected, in the proper mixture ratio, into the combustion chamber through the elements of the injector, as shown in the preceding figure. The injection velocity ranges from about 7 to 60 m/s [ 2]."
What occurs to the propellant droplets once they enter the combustion chamber?," The droplets of the two propellants may either mix together in form of a spray or go separately into the combustion chamber. (2) Then, the high temperature existing in the combustion chamber causes the droplets to vaporise. (3) Then, the vaporised combination of fuel and oxidiser is further heated and burns at its stoichiometric mixture ratio, causing a continuous increase in mass flow rate in the combustion chamber."
What factors must a designer consider to ensure stability in the combustion process within the chamber?," The combustion is aided by the high velocity of the molecules within the combustion chamber, and takes place completely upstream of the throat plane. Care must be taken by the designer in order for the combustion process to be stable, that is, free from shocks and detonation waves in the combustion front."
What occurs to the gas velocity as it passes through the converging section and reaches the throat plane of the nozzle?," (4) Finally, the combusted gas flows in the converging portion of the nozzle. The velocity of the gas increases in subsonic conditions ( M<1 )a n dr e a c h e st h es o n i c value ( M=1) at the throat plane of the nozzle. The subsequent passage through the diverging portion of the nozzle causes the velocity of the gas molecules to increase further in supersonic conditions ( M>1 ) ."
What are the main parts of a thrust chamber in a rocket engine?,"T h ec o m b u s t e dg a si st h e n ejected from the thrust chamber through the exit plane of the nozzle. The principal components of a thrust chamber are the injector including the propel- lant inlets and distributing manifolds, the ignition device (which is necessary in case of a rocket engine burning non-hypergolic propellants), the combustion chamber, the converging portion of the nozzle between the inlet plane and the throat, and the diverging portion of the nozzle between the throat and the exit plane."
What is the shape of the combustion chamber described?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 3]s h o w sat h r u s tc h a m b e ra s s e m b l yc o m p r i s i n g the injector (left) and the combustion chamber including the converging portion of the nozzle (right), for a rocket engine whose propellants are methane and liquid oxygen. 2.1 The Principal Components of a Thrust Chamber 65 The combustion chamber illustrated in the preceding figure is a body of tubular shape."
What is the purpose of the injector in the combustion chamber?," The cross-section narrows in the converging portion of the nozzle and reaches its minimum value at the throat. The diverging portion of the nozzle is usually bell- shaped, in order to allow the combusted gas to expand towards the exit section. The injector has the purpose of distributing the propellants into the combustion chamber at the proper mixture ratio, pressure, and spray pattern, in order to initiate and sustain a stable combustion."
What type of injector is displayed in the cutaway view used in a rocket engine's thrust chamber?," A cutaway view of the injector used in the thrust chamber of a rocket engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (with gaseous fluorine for ignition only) is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 4]. The particular injector shown above is of the shower-head type (described in Sect."
What is the shape and structure of an injector used for propellant injection?," 2.6), where both the fuel and the oxidiser injection holes are drilled at angles which allow the convergent streams of the propellants to meet at a common point placed at a given distance from the injector face. Generally speaking, an injector is a round plate, having a honeycomb structure, with circular and radial inner passages, leading to drilled ori fices."
What material is commonly used for the injector plate in the Rocketdyne H-1 engine?," It is usually made of steel with nickel-plated surfaces, and is held in position at the fuel manifold below the liquid oxygen dome by means of high-strength bolts [ 5]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6], shows the injector plate used for the Rocketdyne H-1 engine, which was used for the S-I and S-IB first stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets."
What type of seals are used between the injector and the thrust chamber body in the H-1 engine?," 66 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly The seals between the injector and the body of the thrust chamber are of the O- ring type, made of rubber selected for compatibility with the fuel. The H-1 engine cited above burns liquid oxygen and RP-1 (kerosene). A threaded hole is provided in the centre of the injector face to permit the installation of the igniter."
What are the two types of impingement angles for propellant injection mentioned in the text?," The fuel and the oxidiser are kept separate by the distribution system. The injection ori fices may be arranged at angles such that the impingement angles should be either equal (uni- planar impingement) or different (multi-planar impingement) for the two propellants. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6], shows the liquid oxygen dome, which is bolted in position above the injector."
What material is used for the construction of the liquid oxygen dome in the H-1 engine?," This figure relates to the same H-1 engine indicated above. The liquid oxygen dome provides the inlet to the liquid oxygen, and is also the attachment interface between the thrust chamber and the vehicle. It is a single-piece, aluminium alloy die forging. The liquid oxygen dome and the injector have flanges 2."
"What material is used for the gasket in the thrust chamber, and what determines the type of gasket used?","1 The Principal Components of a Thrust Chamber 67 which are sealed by a spirally wound gasket made of stainless steel strips with non- asbestos fillers (aramid or graphite fibres). The type of gasket used depends on the range of temperature in working conditions. For thrust-vector-controlled engines, as is the case, for example, with the Rocketdyne J-2 engine, the liquid oxygen dome also serves as a mount for the gimbal bearing."
How is the pyrotechnic igniter of a rocket engine physically secured to the injector surface?," The thrust vector control of rocket engines will be considered in Sect. 2.2. Finally, the pyrotechnic igniter of an engine is fired electrically, and is fixed to the injector surface by means of a threaded joint. It is designed for a single start, and must therefore be replaced after each firing. Igniters of this and other types will be described and illustrated at length in Sect."
What factors influence the design of a thrust chamber for controlling the direction of a thrust vector in rockets or spacecraft?," 2.8. 2.2 The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control The present paragraph concerns the methods used to control the direction of the thrust vector in a rocket or spacecraft. These methods are considered here in view of their bearing on the design of a thrust chamber, as will be shown below."
What ability does thrust vector control provide a space vehicle related to the direction of thrust?," By thrust vector control we mean the ability of a space vehicle to de flect the direction of the thrust away (that is, at an angle, θ,o t h e rt h a nz e r o )f r o mt h el o n g i t u d i n a la x i so ft h e vehicle. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 7], shows the principal axes of inertia and the rotations in roll, pitch and yaw for the Space Shuttle."
What are the two primary reasons for requiring control in vehicle flight dynamics?," The necessity of this control arises from several causes. First, an intentional change of the direction of the flight path followed by the centre of mass of the vehicle. Second, an intentional change of attitude (or rotation) of the vehicle about one or more of 68 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly the principal axes of inertia passing through its centre of mass."
What corrections are needed to align the thrust vector with the gravity force vector for maintaining trajectory and orientation?," Third, a correction of either the flight path or the attitude which becomes necessary in order for the vehicle to maintain the desired trajectory and orientation. Fourth, a correction of the misalignment between the thrust vector and the gravity force vector. As to the last issue, the thrust vector is applied to the nozzle of the vehicle, whereas the gravity force vector is applied to its centre of gravity, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 8]."
What alignment of the thrust and weight vectors prevents unwanted torques in a vehicle?," In order for the vehicle not to be subject to unwanted torques, the directions of the thrust and weight vectors must be aligned at πradians (180°). A rocket is also subject, when flying through the atmosphere, to aerodynamic forces (lift and drag), which are applied to its centre of pressure, not to its centre of gravity, as shown in the preceding figure."
What causes a rocket to rotate around its centre of gravity during flight?," These forces produce moments about the principal axes of inertia of the vehicle. These moments, in turn, cause the vehicle to rotate about its centre of gravity. For a stable flight, the centre of gravity of a rocket must be above its centre of pressure. The longitudinal axis of the rocket, or the line joining the tip of the nose with the centre of the exit section of the nozzle, is called the roll axis, and a motion of the rocket about the roll axis is called a rolling motion."
What happens to the rocket's nose when pitch moments are applied?, The centre of gravity of the rocket lies along the roll axis. The pitch and yaw axes are mutually perpendicular and form a plane passing through the centre of gravity and perpendicular to the roll axis. Pitch moments tend to either lower or raise the nose of the rocket. Yaw moments cause the nose to move from side to side.
What are two types of methods that can be utilized for steering forces in rockets?," Both mechanical and aerodynamic methods can be used to re-direct the rocket thrust and provide the necessary steering forces. Some of such methods use static fins, movable fins, jet vanes, jetevators, canards, gimballed (that is, swivelled) nozzles, Vernier rockets, fuel injectors, and attitude-control rockets, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 9]."
What role do static fins play in a rocket's navigation while it travels through the atmosphere?," 2.2 The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control 69 As long as a rocket travels in the atmosphere, static fins at the tail of the rocket can generate aerodynamic forces which act at the centre of pressure and generate moments about the centre of gravity. These moments oppose the de flection of the rocket in the directions of the pitch and yaw axes."
What must the dimensions of stationary fins ensure when counteracting deviations during atmospheric flight?," Of course, the static fins must be so sized as to generate the amount of aerodynamic forces required to counteract the deviations. On the other hand, the fins generate further drag, in the direction opposed to the rocket velocity vector. In spite of that, aerodynamic fins, be they fixed or movable, are very effective for controlling a vehicle flying through the atmosphere."
What type of thrust vector control system is described as a fixed device that stabilizes a rocket externally?," They continue to be used in weather rockets, anti-aircraft missiles, and air-to surface missiles. Generally speaking, a thrust vector control system used in a rocket may be either passive or active. A passive control system is a fixed device meant to stabilise a rocket by its very presence on the outside of the rocket."
What is the main function of the fins mounted on a rocket near its nozzle?," An example of such a device is a cluster of fins mounted around the lower end of a rocket, near the nozzle. The purpose of the fins is to keep the centre of pressure below the centre of gravity of the rocket. In order to overcome the disadvantages (higher drag and mass) of the fins, active control systems have been developed."
What surfaces are utilized to redirect exhaust gases in the jet stream of a rocket?," They are described below. Jet vanes and movable fins are planar surfaces, which are used in the jet stream of a rocket to de flect the exhaust gases. They are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 10]. 70 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Thrust vanes have been employed on the V-2 and Redstone missiles to de flect the exhaust gas jet of the main propulsion motors by carbon vanes."
"What component, invented by Dr. Willy Fiedler, alters the direction of jet flow in a rocket?"," Jetevators, which are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Lock- heed [ 11], are control surfaces which can be moved into or against the jet stream of a rocket, in order to change the direction of the jet flow. The jetevator invented by Dr. Willy Fiedler is a solid ring with a spherical inside surface which is hinged over the rocket nozzle [ 12,p a g e5 2 ] ."
What mechanism replaced the vanes in the A2 version of the Polaris missile to manage exhaust flow?,"T h i sd e v i c e ,w h i c hw a su s e di nt h eA 1v e r s i o no ft h e Polaris missile and then replaced by rotatable nozzles in the A2 version, de flects the flow when turned into the exhaust stream. It has the advantage of not causing propul- sion losses when in the neutral position, since, unlike vanes, it does not interfere with the exhaust flow [ 10]."
What is the primary function of the device described by Edwards and Parker in relation to solid-propellant rockets?," The same device has also been described by Edwards and Parker as a semi-spherical shell hinged to a rocket nozzle and rotated, at the command of a sensing unit, into the exhaust flow to produce a control force. Jetevators have been most frequently applied to control the direction of thrust of solid-propellant rockets [ 10]."
What are canards used for in rockets or aircraft?," 2.2 The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control 71 Canards are fore-plane surfaces mounted on the front end of a rocket or aircraft. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 13], shows such surfaces. 72 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Movable fins and canards are quite similar to each other in appearance."
What are the locations of canards and movable fins on a rocket?," The only real difference is their location on the rocket, because canards are mounted on the front end, whereas the movable fins are at the rear end. In flight, both of them tilt as rudders to de flect the air flow and cause the rocket to correct its course, in the event of unwanted directional changes being detected by motion sensors [ 14]."
What is the purpose of gimbaling the nozzle in rocket engines?," Another method for changing the direction of the exhaust gases, and hence the direction of the rocket, is to gimbal the nozzle. For this purpose, the engine can be mounted in a two-axis ring-suspension system, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 15]. This figure, which relates to the engine gimbal system of the Viking Orbiter 1975, shows the two actuators mounted along directions parallel to, but not coincident with, respectively, the pitch axis ( Y)a n dt h ey a wa x i s (Z)o ft h ev e h i c l e ."
What type of propellant was used in the Viking 1 orbiter's propulsion system?,"T h i si sb e c a u s et h eo r i g i no ft h er o l l ,p i t c h ,a n dy a wa x e si st h e centre of mass of the vehicle. The Viking 1 orbiter (NSSDCA/COSPAR ID: 1975-075A) was launched from Cape Canaveral on the 20th of August 1975. The propulsion of the Viking 1 orbiter was furnished by a bi-propellant (monomethyl hydrazine, CH 3NHNH 2,a n dn i t r o g e n tetroxide, N 2O4)l i q u i d - f u e l l e dr o c k e te n g i n ew h i c hc o u l db et i l t e du pt o π/20 rad (9°)."
How was attitude control achieved in roll during engine burns?," Attitude control during engine burns was provided in roll ( X-axis) by the attitude control system (using 12 small compressed-nitrogen gas jets located at the solar panel tips), and in pitch and yaw by an autopilot which commanded the engine gimbal system shown above [ 16]. Another type of gimbal system, relating to the Rocketdyne J-2 engine, is shown at the top of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 17]."
What type of bearing is used in the gimbal system for thrust vector control?," 2.2 The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control 73 This type of gimbal system has a highly loaded (1.38 ×108N/m2)u n i v e r s a l joint which is a spherical, socket-type bearing with a Te flon®/ fibreglass composition coating which provides a dry, low friction bearing surface. It also has a lateral adjust- ment device for aligning the thrust chamber with the vehicle."
What function does the gimbal system perform in relation to the injector assembly and thrust structure?," This gimbal system transmits the thrust from the injector assembly to the thrust structure of the vehicle, and provides a pivot bearing for de flection of the thrust vector. As shown in the preceding figure, the gimbal is mounted on the top of the injector and liquid oxygen dome assembly [ 17]. This gimbal bearing system has been used in the Saturn V rocket and in the Space Shuttle [ 14]."
What happens to the thrust direction when the nozzle is swivelled away from the rocket's axis of symmetry?," In a gimballed thrust control system, the nozzle of the rocket can be swivelled from side to side. As the nozzle direction is de flected away from the axis of symmetry of the rocket, so does the direction of the thrust change with respect to the centre of gravity of the vehicle. In a Vernier thrust control system, small rockets are mounted on the outside of the main thruster."
What is the primary function of attitude-control rockets according to the provided information?," In case of need, such rockets are fired in the proper direction, in order to produce the desired course change [ 14]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 18], shows a Vernier rocket mounted on the outside of the Atlas rocket. 74 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Attitude-control rockets, shown below, are used to trim misalignments of the translational thruster, the basic attitude control with respect to the body principal axes being provided by a separate set of thrusters."
What type of rockets are employed during the coasting phase of flight for vehicle orientation?," By so doing, the main engine is used only for the motion of the centre of mass of the vehicle. Attitude-control rockets are used in the coasting phase of flight. For this 2.2 The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control 75 purpose, clusters of small rockets are mounted all around a space vehicle."
What type of engine did the Apollo Lunar Module use for translation during ascent?," By firing these small rockets in the proper combination, it is possible to turn the vehicle in the desired direction. After the vehicle has been aimed as required, the main engine is fired, in order to send the vehicle in the new direction. For example, the ascent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module used a fixed, high-thrust engine for translation and a series of small liquid-propellant rockets for attitude control, as shown in the preceding figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [ 19]."
What components are necessary to operate thrust vector control in high-temperature conditions of rocket exhaust?," The methods described above use, all of them, mechanical means to control the direction of the thrust vector. They require actuating components which must work ef ficiently in the high-temperature environment of the rocket exhaust and are invari- ably associated with a loss of axial thrust when performing manoeuvres of thrust vector control [ 20]."
What mechanisms do alternative methods utilize to execute the same function without needing mechanical actuators?," Other methods use fluidic means to perform the same function. These methods use as t a t i cn o z z l ea n dt h ei n j e c t i o n( o rt h er e m o v a l )o fas e c o n d a r y fl o wi n t o( o rf r o m ) the region between the primary flow, which generates the thrust, and the nozzle. They do not require any kinematic structure and mechanical actuators."
What phenomenon describes a high-speed fluid stream adhering to a convexly curved surface instead of moving in a straight line?," There is a variety of methods based on fluidic thrust vectoring, which differ one from the other by the way in which the secondary flow is used for thrust vector control. They may be classi fied as follows. •Co- flow for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is based on the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect (so named after the Romanian engineer Henri-Marie Coanda) is the phenomenon in which a stream of fluid, ejected at high speed from a slot and coming in contact with a convexly curved surface, adheres to that surface along its curvature rather than continue to travel in a straight line."
What effect does the curvature of a divergent wall have on fluid velocity and pressure?," In other words, the stream is de flected from the axis of flow and follows the slope (or curvature) of a divergent wall whilst increasing in velocity and in mass by entraining additional fluid [ 21]. This happens because of the increase in the flow velocity over the curved surface, which causes pressure to decrease."
What is the effect of low pressure on the direction of the primary flow and injected co-flow relative to the nozzle axis?," The low pressure causes not only the injected co- flow but also the primary flow to be de flected off the nozzle axis toward the divergent wall, as shown in the preceding figure, where the 76 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly black arrows represent the primary flow, and the red arrows represent the injected co- flow."
What thrust vector control method produces the smallest deflection angle according to the information provided?," Of all the fluidic methods for controlling the thrust vector, the co- flow method has been found [ 22]t ob et h eo n ew h i c hp r o d u c e st h es m a l l e s td e fl e c t i o na n g l e . •Counter- flow for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is also based on the Coanda effect to de flect the thrust vector, as shown in the following figure."
How is the secondary counter-flowing stream created between the primary jet and the adjacent surface according to Strykowski et al?," Strykowski et al [ 23]h a v es h o w nt h a tt h et h r u s td u et oaj e ts t r e a mc a nb ec o n t i n u - ously de flected to at least 0.2793 rad (16°) by creating a secondary counter- flowing stream between the primary jet and an adjacent curved surface. For this purpose, suction is applied asymmetrically between the trailing edge of a primary nozzle and an aft suction collar."
What is the percentage relationship between the thrust loss and the primary jet mass flow rates as indicated by Strykowski et al.?," This creates a low-pressure region along the suction collar, and causes the primary jet to turn [ 24). The results found by Strykowski et al. [ 23]a tM a c h2s h o wt h a tt h et h r u s tl o s si sl e s st h a n4 %a n dt h er e q u i r e dm a s s flow rates are less than approximately 2% of the primary jet."
What effect does asymmetrical activation of the co-flow have on the primary flow direction?," A co- flow, due to the viscous entrainment generated by the primary flow, takes place at the wall of the suction collar, and interferes with the primary flow. By activating asymmetrically this co- flow, the primary flow is de flected towards the side on which the suction flow is applied, due to the pressure drop which causes the thrust to turn [ 22]."
What is the purpose of injecting secondary flow at or just upstream of the throat in fluidic thrust vectoring?," •Throat-shifting for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is performed by injecting secondary flow at or just upstream of the throat, as shown in the following figure. By so doing, there is no formation of shock waves. 2.2 The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control 77 This injection skews the sonic plane and de flects the flow."
What is the purpose of variable recessed cavities in the described method?," Another version of this method uses variable recessed cavities, which de flect the primary flow by means of vortices in the cavities, as shown in the following figure. The recessed cavity portion of the nozzle shown above is located between the upstream minimum area and the downstream minimum area of the nozzle itself."
What technique was combined with cavitation methods to enhance performance in the study by Deere et al.?," The fluidic injection is performed at the upstream minimum area. A simulation study carried out by Deere et al. [ 25]h a ss h o w nt h a ts u b s t a n t i a lt h r u s t - v e c t o r angles are obtainable without large penalties in thrust ef ficiency. This version is ac o m b i n e dm e t h o d ,b e c a u s et h er e c e s s e d - c a v i t yt e c h n i q u ei su s e di na d d i t i o nt o the throat-shifting technique in order to obtain greater performance."
What role does the secondary injected flow play in the nozzle's operation regarding shock wave induction?," •Shock vector control for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is performed by injecting secondary flow downstream of the throat, as shown in the following figure. 78 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly The secondary injected flow acts as a compression ramp in the direction of the primary supersonic flow. This compression induces an oblique shock wave in the diverging portion of the nozzle at some angle with respect to the direction of the primary flow."
How does the oblique shock wave affect the thrust vector direction during nozzle interaction?," The primary flow, when interacting with the oblique shock wave, turns away from the axis of symmetry of the nozzle. This turn changes the direction of the thrust vector. By so doing, the direction of the primary flow does not change in the vicinity of the throat. The shock vector control may also be combined with the throat shifting, by using two ports instead of one to inject the secondary flow into the nozzle, as shown in the following figure."
What are the key advantages of aerospace vehicles utilizing fluidic thrust vectoring methods?," The aerospace vehicles which use fluidic instead of mechanical thrust vectoring methods have the advantages of being lightweight, free from moving parts, less expensive, easy to integrate, and less detectable by radars, the last advantage being of particular interest in military applications. On the other hand, they must be designed from the outset as such, and existing vehicles currently in use cannot be retro fitted."
What angle in radians corresponds to the value obtained by Strykowski et alii through the counter-flow technique?," In addition, their capability of directional change is often held to be lower than that of vehicles using mechanical thrust vectoring. On the last issue, Strykowski et alii [23]h a v eo b t a i n e dat h r u s tv e c t o ra n g l eo f0 . 2 7 9 3r a d( 1 6 ° )b yu s i n gt h ec o u n t e r - flow technique described above, and Wing and Giuliano [ 26]h a v eo b t a i n e dav a l u e of up to π/10 rad (18°) for this angle, by using the shock vector control technique."
What is the maximum value in radians for the movable nozzle related to the thrust vector control system?," Such values are by no means small in comparison with those cited by Sutton and Biblarz [ 2,p a g e6 1 1 ] ,T a b l e1 6 . 1f o rm e c h a n i c a lt h r u s tv e c t o r i n gs y s t e m s .T h e ya r e 2.2 The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control 79 lower only than the value of π/9 rad (20°), relating to the movable nozzle (rotary ball with gas seal)."
What issue arises when the secondary flow source for fluidic thrust vectoring is the same as the primary flow?," Another disadvantage of the fluidic thrust vectoring methods has been found in their need for a source of secondary flow. In the event of that source being the same as that of the primary flow which generates the thrust, it has been argued, the performance of the vehicle would decrease, at least in the phase of thrust vector control."
What was the maximum thrust loss observed at Mach 2 according to Strykowski et al.?," As to the loss in performance, Strykowski et al. [ 23]h a v ef o u n d ,a tM a c h 2, a thrust loss lower than 4%, with the required mass flow rates being lower than approximately 2% of the primary jet. Consequently, the only strong disadvantage of the fluidic thrust vectoring methods seems to us to be the de ficiency or insuf ficiency of data on their behaviour gathered by testing them in flight."
What indicator of a rocket engine's thrust chamber is defined using force and measured in seconds?," 2.3 Performance of a Thrust Chamber The performance of the thrust chamber of a rocket engine is measured by some indicators, which have been discussed at length in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.3.F o rc o n v e n i e n c e of the reader, a list of the principal performance indicators is also given below. (1) Speci fic impulse ( Is)tcof the thrust chamber, which is measured in seconds and is de fined by (Is)tc=F ."
What is the formula for characteristic velocity in terms of the total temperature and Mach number at the nozzle inlet?," Wtc=c∗CF g0 where F(N) is the thrust, . Wtc=g0 . mtc(N/s)is the weight flow rate of the propellant at the thrust chamber, c* (m/s) is the characteristic velocity, CFis the dimensionless thrust coef ficient, and g0=9.80665 m/s2is the acceleration of gravity of the Earth at the sea level. (2) Characteristic velocity c*, which is measured in m/s and is de fined by c∗= [ gamma R(Tc)ns ] 1 2 gamma [ /parenleftBig 2 gamma +1/parenrightBig gamma +1 gamma - 1 ] 1 2 where ( Tc)ns=Ti[1+ 1/2 ( gamma - 1)M2 i]i st h et o t a lt e m p e r a t u r e( K )o ft h ec o m b u s t i o n chamber at the nozzle inlet, Miis the Mach number at the nozzle inlet, gamma equivalent cp/cv is the speci fic heat ratio of the combusted gas, and Ris the constant of the speci fic gas, that is, the universal gas constant R*=8314."
What is the relationship between the constant R and the average molar mass M of the combusted gas?,"460 N m kmol - 1K - 1divided by the average molar mass M(kg/kmol) of the combusted gas. When the propellant combination and its mixture ratio have been chosen, then the speci fic heat ratio gamma 80 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly and the constant R=R*/Mof the combusted gas are also determined within known limits."
What factors influence the characteristic velocity at the nozzle inlet in a combustion chamber?," In these limits, the characteristic velocity depends on the total temperature (Tc)nsof the gas in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet. (3) Thrust coef ficient CF,w h i c hi sd i m e n s i o n l e s sa n di sd e fi n e db y CF= { 2 gamma 2 gamma - 1 ( 2 gamma +1 ) gamma +1 gamma - 1 [ 1 - ( pe (pc)ns ) gamma - 1 gamma ] } 1 2 +Ae At [ pe - p0 (pc)ns ] where gamma equivalent cp/cvis the speci fic heat ratio of the combusted gas, pe(N/m2)i st h e pressure of the exhaust gas at the exit plane of the nozzle, ( pc)ns(N/m2)i st h et o t a l pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet, p0(N/m2)i st h ea m b i e n t pressure, and ε equivalent Ae/Atis the ratio of the area of the cross-section at the exit plane of the nozzle to the area of the cross-section at the throat."
What geometric factor influences the value of the second addend related to the nozzle in the combustion performance equation?," When the performance of the combustion process has been determined, then the value of the first addend on the right-hand side of the preceding equation is known. The value of the second addend depends on the geometric characteristics of the diverging portion of the nozzle, namely, on the expansion ratio ε equivalent Ae/At,w h i c hd e t e r m i n e st h ep r e s s u r e ratios pe/(pc)nsandp0/(pc)ns."

What factors should be considered when selecting the shape of a combustion chamber?," On the other hand, a cylindrical combustion chamber having a large cross section and a small length leaves a space suf ficient for propellant mixing but insuf ficient for a complete combustion. Further considerations to be taken into account in choosing a shape concern heat transfer, stability of combustion, weight, and easiness of manufacturing."
What type of shape was used for the combustion chamber of the V-2 missile?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 27], shows the two principal shapes, namely, spherical (or near-spherical) and cylindrical, which may be chosen for a combustion chamber.

In addition, for the same pressure and for the same strength of the materials used, the walls of a spherical combustion chamber can be less thick than those of a cylindrical combustion chamber."
What is the shape that is primarily chosen for a combustion chamber due to easier manufacturing and higher performance?," On the other hand, a spherical combustion chamber is more dif ficult to manufacture and offers a lower performance than is the case with a cylindrical combustion chamber.

Since a given expansion ratio ε equivalent Ae/Atresults in the optimum expansion only at a speci fic altitude, then the design expansion ratio of a nozzle must be selected in such a way as to give the best average performance during powered flight."
What are the two main types of nozzle designs mentioned that facilitate supersonic expansion of combusted gas?," The supersonic expansion of the combusted gas occurs in the diverging portion of the nozzle. The two principal types (bell-shaped and conical) of the diverging portion of a nozzle are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [28]. 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 87 Ab e l l - s h a p e dn o z z l e( l e f t )h a st h ea d v a n t a g e s ,o v e rac o n i c a ln o z z l e( r i g h t ) , of better performance and shorter length."
What effect does the radial-flow section in the initial divergent region have on the flow at the nozzle's exit cross-section?," The former has a radial- flow section in the initial divergent region. This fact generates a uniform flow directed along the symmetry axis at the exit cross-section of the nozzle. In addition, the gradual change of the wall angle with respect to the axis prevents oblique shocks. Some of the methods (in particular, those due to Prandtl-Busemann, Puckett, and Foelsch) to determine a nozzle contour have been described by Crown [ 29]."
What factors influence the selection of an optimum nozzle shape for a specific expansion ratio?," Rao [30]h a sa p p l i e dt h ec a l c u l u so fv a r i a t i o n st od e t e r m i n et h es h a p eo fan o z z l ec o n t o u r leading to the maximum thrust. For engineering purposes, near-optimum parabolic contours are suitable for many applications [ 28]. According to Huzel and Huang [ 5], the optimum shape of a nozzle having a given expansion ratio is chosen on the basis of the following considerations: •uniform parallel axial flow of the combusted gas at the exit section of the nozzle for the maximum magnitude of the momentum vector; •minimum losses due to separation and turbulence within the nozzle; •shortest possible length of the nozzle for minimum requirements of space envelope, weight, losses due to friction at the walls, and cooling; and •easiness of manufacturing."
What are the two primary benefits of using a conical nozzle instead of a bell-shaped nozzle?," In practice, the cone and the bell are the most frequently used of all shapes for the diverging portion of a rocket nozzle. The advantages of a conical nozzle over a bell-shaped nozzle are easiness of manufacturing, and capability of increasing or decreasing its exit section, without the necessity of re-designing the full surface of the nozzle."
What is the range of the semi-aperture angle in the converging section of the nozzle?," The diverging portion of ac o n i c a ln o z z l ei ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e . 88 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly On both sides of the throat plane, the contour of the nozzle is a circular arc, whose radius Rranges from 0.5 to 1.5 times the radius Rtof the throat [ 5]. In the converging portion (not shown in the preceding figure) of the nozzle, the angle θof semi-aperture ranges from π/9 rad to π/4 rad (from 20 to 45°)."
What is the typical semi-aperture angle chosen in practice for the diverging portion of a conical nozzle?," The semi-aperture angle αof the diverging portion of the nozzle varies from about π/15 rad to π/10 rad (from 12 to 18°) [ 5]. The length Lnof the diverging portion of a conical nozzle is expressed by the following equation of [ 5]: Ln=Rt [ /parenleftBig Ae At/parenrightBig1 2 - 1 ] +R(secα - 1) tanα In practice, π/12 rad (15°) is the most frequently chosen value for the divergence angle αof a conical nozzle, for reasons of weight, length, and performance."
What happens to the direction of gas momentum in a conical nozzle due to the divergence angle of the exhaust gas velocity vector?," In case of a conical nozzle, the velocity vector veof the exhaust gas at the exit plane of the nozzle forms the divergence angle αwith respect to the axis of symmetry of the nozzle. Therefore, not all the gas momentum is in the axial direction, there being a non-axial component of the exhaust gas velocity vector."
What is the formula that represents the thrust of a rocket engine with a conical nozzle using the factor for axial momentum loss?," This loss of axial momentum in a conical nozzle is taken into account by means of the factor λ=1 2(1+cosα) where λis the ratio between the momentum of the gases in a nozzle with a semi- aperture angle αand the momentum of an ideal nozzle with all gases flowing in the axial direction [ 2]. With this factor, the thrust of a rocket engine having a conical nozzle is [ 31]: F=λ ."
What value of λ is obtained for a conical nozzle with an angle of π/12 radians?," mve+Ae(pe - p0) In the ideal case of all the gas momentum being in the axial direction at the exit plane of a nozzle, the factor λis equal to unity. In the case of a conical nozzle having as e m i - a p e r t u r ea n g l e α=π/12 rad =15°, there results λ=0.983, and therefore 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 89 the velocity of the exhaust gas at the exit plane of a conical nozzle is in magnitude 98."
What advantages does a bell-shaped nozzle provide in terms of gas flow expansion and exit flow direction?,"3% of the velocity of the gas for an ideal nozzle. For the purposes of reducing the length Lnof the divergent portion of a nozzle and increasing the performance, a bell-shaped nozzle has been studied. This type of nozzle offers the advantages of decreasing the portion of nozzle where the gas flow expands, and changing gradually the local angle of semi-aperture, so as to have a uniform, nearly axially directed flow at the exit plane."
What method combined with calculus of variations was used to determine the optimal contour for maximum thrust in a bell-shaped nozzle in 1958?," In addition, since the slope of the wall contour changes continuously, then the formation of oblique shocks is avoided. The optimum contour for a bell-shaped nozzle which leads to the maximum magnitude of thrust has been determined in 1958 by Rao [ 30], by using the method of characteristics combined with the calculus of variations."
What is the semi-aperture angle of the equivalent conical nozzle mentioned?," Several computer programmes have subsequently been developed (see, for example, 32)i no r d e rt o determine the optimum contour by applying the method described by Rao [ 30]. In practice, an equivalent conical nozzle having a semi-aperture angle α=π/12≈ 0.2618 rad =15° is used as a standard to specify the length of a bell-shaped nozzle."
What is the relationship between the true length of a bell-shaped nozzle and the length of a conical nozzle with a semi-aperture angle of 15 degrees?," For example, a bell-shaped nozzle is said to have a fractional length Lf=n%w h e n its true length Ln,m e a s u r e df r o mt h et h r o a tp l a n et ot h ee x i tp l a n e ,i s Ln=n 100Rt tan 0.2618 [ ε1 2 - 1+1.5 ( 1 cos 0 .2618 - 1 ) ] that is, when the true length Lnof that nozzle is n/100 times the length of a conical nozzle having a semi-aperture angle α=π/12 rad =15°, the same radius Rtat the throat plane, and the same expansion ratio ε equivalent Ae/At."
What is the effect of a bell-shaped nozzle with a fractional length greater than 85% on the nozzle correction factor?,"I th a sb e e np r o v e de x p e r i - mentally that a bell-shaped nozzle whose fractional length Lfis greater than about 85% does not offer substantial advantages for the purpose of increasing the nozzle correction factor λ,b e c a u s ea ni n c r e a s ei nl e n g t hi m p l i e sa ni n c r e a s ei nm a s s ."
What design method did the authors use to create a near-optimum bell contour for the Thrust Chamber Assembly?,"T h i s fact is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5]. 90 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Rao [ 33]a n do t h e ra u t h o r sh a v ef o u n dac o n v e n i e n tw a yt od e s i g nan e a r - o p t i m u m bell contour by using a parabolic approximation to the optimum contour."
What is the relationship between the radius of the nozzle contour in the converging section and the radius of the throat?," This parabolic approximation is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5]. In the converging portion of the nozzle, immediately upstream of the throat plane, the nozzle contour is a circular arc, whose radius is equal to 1.5 times Rt,w h e r e Rtis the radius of the throat. This arc terminates at the point T, where T is the point in which this arc intersects the throat plane."
"What is the radius of the circular arc in the diverging portion of the nozzle, expressed as a fraction of Rt?"," The angle which subtends this circular arc is to be chosen by the designer. In the diverging portion of the nozzle, immediately downstream of the throat plane, the nozzle contour is also a circular arc, whose radius is equal to 0.382 times Rt.T h i sc i r c u l a ra r cg o e sf r o mt h ep o i n t Tt ot h ep o i n to fi n fl e c t i o nN ,w h e r eNi st h ep o i n ti nw h i c ht h ep a r a b o l i cs e g m e n t begins."

How is the true length of a bell-shaped nozzle mathematically related to its fractional length and an equivalent conical nozzle?," Of course, the true length Lnof a bell-shaped nozzle may be expressed in terms of the fractional length Lf,w i t hr e f e r e n c et oa ne q u i v a l e n tc o n i c a ln o z z l eh a v i n ga semi-aperture angle π/12 radians (15°).

Let Q be the point of intersection of these straight lines. Next, both of these lines are divided into an equal number of segments, which is four in the following figure."
"What is the relationship between the straight lines drawn from points a to e, b to f, and c to g, and the resulting parabola?"," The terminal points of these segments are labelled a, b, c and e, f, g. A straight line is drawn from point a to point e, then another from b to f, and another from ct og .T h e s es t r a i g h tl i n e sf o r mam e s h ,w h o s ee d g eg i v e st h ep a r a b o l ao u t l i n e . This parabola is also tangent to the straight lines QN and QE."
What results from using more divisions in a CAD package when designing a contour?," By using many more divisions, for example by means of a CAD package, there results a sharper contour. A series of straight-line segments results from removing most of the mesh. By joining the midpoint of each segment with a smooth curve, such as a CAD spline, there results the nozzle contour. 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 93 For the same purpose, an analytical method based on Bézier curves has also been suggested by Newlands [ 35]."
What is the radius at the throat of the nozzle in centimeters?," Without loss of generality, this method is described below by means of a numerical example. With reference to the preceding figure, we consider a nozzle having a radius Rt=13.8 cm measured in the plane of the throat, an expansion area ratio ε equivalent Ae/At=70, and a fractional length Lf=80% of aπ/12-rad =15° equivalent conical nozzle."
What are the angles formed by the tangents to the nozzle's contour at points N and E with the x-axis?," We want to determine the equation of the parabolic segment of nozzle going from the in flexion point N to the exit point E, where the axes xandyand their origin O are shown in the preceding figure. For this value of fractional length, the Rao curves give the angles θn=0.5760 rad =33° and θe=0.1222 rad =7° which the tangents to the contour of the nozzle in the points respectively N and E form with the axis of symmetry ( x-axis) of the nozzle."
"What is the calculated true length of the nozzle when n equals 80, Rt is 13.8 cm, and ε is 70?"," These wall angles result from extrapolating the graphs given above. By substituting n= 80,Rt=13.8 cm, and ε=70 in the following formula, the true length of the nozzle results Ln=n 100Rt tan 0.2618 [ ε1 2 - 1+1.5 ( 1 cos 0 .2618 - 1 ) ] =305.70cm We take 0.5760 rad for the value of the angle αsubtending the circular arc TN of radius 0."
What are the calculated x and y coordinates of point E on the exit plane of the nozzle?,"382 Rt,d o w n s t r e a mo ft h et h r o a t .T h e r e f o r e ,t h ec o - o r d i n a t e so fNa r e xN=0.382Rtsinα=0.382×13.8×sin 0.5760 =2.8711cm yN=Rt[1+0.382(1 - cosα)]=13.8×[1+0.382×(1 - cos 0 .576)] =14.650cm The co-ordinates of the point E laying on the exit plane of the nozzle are xE=Ln=305."
"What is the value of y when substituting yN, xN, and θn into the equation of line NQ?","70 cm yE=RE=ε1 2Rt=701 2×13.8=115.46 cm 94 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly From the in flection point N, we produce the straight line NQ, which forms the angle θnwith the x-axis. As is well known, the equation of NQ is y - yN=(x - xN)tanθn By substituting yN=14.650 cm, xN=2.8711 cm, and θn=0.5760 rad into the preceding equation, there results y=0."
"What is the equation of the line produced from point E using the given values for yE, xE, and θe?","64941 x+12.785 Likewise, from the exit point E, we produce the straight line QE, which forms the angle θewith the x-axis. The equation of QE is y - yE=(x - xE)tanθe By substituting yE=115.46 cm, xE=305.70 cm, and θe=0.1222 rad into the preceding equation, there results y=0.12278 x+77.925 The straight line NQ (whose equation is y=0."
"What are the parametric equations for the y-coordinate of point P on the Bézier quadratic curve defined by points N, Q, and E?","64941 x+12.785) intersects the straight line QE (whose equation is y=0.12278 x+77.925) in the point Q, whose co-ordinates are easily found to be xQ=123.69 cm yQ=93.112 cm Since the co-ordinates of the points N, Q, and E are known, then the parabolic segment of nozzle going from N to E can be expressed by means of a Bézier quadratic curve having the following parametric equations x(t)=(1 - t)2xN+2(1 - t)txQ+t2xE(0≤t≤1) y(t)=(1 - t)2yN+2(1 - t)tyQ+t2yE(0≤t≤1) The preceding equations specify the co-ordinates xandyof any point P of this curve corresponding to a value of ttaken between 0 and 1."
What values of the parameter t are assigned to determine the coordinates of points other than N and E?," For example, the co- ordinates of three points P 1,P2,a n dP 3(other than N and E) of the curve can be determined by assigning the values 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 to the parameter t. In the present case, after substituting the values of ( xN,yN), (xQ,yQ), and ( xE,yE) computed above into the preceding equations, there results x(t)=2."
What do the given equations represent in the context of nozzle design between specific points in a reference system?,8711 (1 - t)2+247.38(1 - t)t+305.70t2(0≤t≤1) y(t)=14.650(1 - t)2+186.22(1 - t)t+115.46t2(0≤t≤1) 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 95 The preceding equations express analytically the segment of nozzle going from the in flection point N to the exit point E in the reference system O xyshown in the preceding figure.
What do the boundary conditions specify in relation to the endpoints and the tangents at those points?," As has been shown above, the coef ficients of these equations have been determined in such a way as to satisfy the four boundary conditions, which specify the co-ordinates of the endpoints N and E and the angles θnandθewhich the tangents to the parabola in these points form with the x-axis. In the general case, there may be no set of three coef ficients a,b,a n d cwhose values satisfy exactly the boundary conditions speci fied above, in order to express the contour of a nozzle by means of the equation y(x)=ax2+bx+c."
What is the form of the equation used to express the contour of a bell nozzle under specific design requirements?,"S u c hi st h ec a s e with the numerical example given above, since xQ̸=(xN+xE)/2. This is because a parabola can be expressed by the equation y=ax2+bx+conly when its axis of symmetry is parallel to the y-axis. When the requirements posed to the designer of a bell nozzle are: (a) the continuity of its contour; (b) the continuity of its slope; and (c) the respect of the four boundary conditions speci fied above, independently of whether a parabola or any other smooth curve may be chosen, then the contour can be expressed by a cubic equation, as follows y(x)=ax3+bx2+cx+d where the unknown values of the coef ficients a,b,c,a n d dresult from solving the following system of four linear equations yN=ax3 N+bx2 N+cxN+d yE=ax3 E+bx2 E+cxE+d tanθn=3ax2 N+2bxN+c tanθe=3ax2 E+2bxE+c In the numerical example given above, after substituting the known values of xN, yN,xE,yE,θnandθein the four preceding equations, we find the following values: a=1."
What type of nozzles are designed with propellant combusted into a ring surrounding the base?,"1602 ×10 - 6,b= - 0.0014065, c=0.65746, and d=12.774. The exhaust gas generated within the combustion chamber need not flow along the axis of symmetry of the nozzle. Such is the case with the two annular nozzles illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 28]. 96 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Annular (or plug or altitude-compensating) nozzles are so called because the propellant is combusted into a ring, also called an annulus, which is located around the base of the nozzle."
What are the two principal types of nozzles mentioned in the description provided?," They are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5], which also illustrates a conical nozzle and a bell-shaped nozzle. Ac e n t r a lb o d y ,a l s oc a l l e dap l u g ,k e e p st h eg a s fl o wa w a yf r o mac e n t r a lp o r t i o n of the nozzle. There are two principal types of annular nozzles."
What are the three subtypes of the radial out-flow type nozzle?," They are the radial in- flow type (spike nozzle) and the radial out- flow type. The latter type, in turn, includes expansion-de flection or E-D, reverse- flow or R-F, and horizontal- flow or H-F nozzles. The nozzles shown above have, all of them, the same level of thrust, the same expansion area ratio, and the same theoretical thrust coef ficient CF(see Chap."
What is the expansion area ratio for an annular nozzle defined as?," 1, Sect. 1.3). Annular nozzles are shorter than conical or bell-shaped nozzles, and are therefore advantageous over the latter in terms of length and mass of the whole vehicle. 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 97 For an annular nozzle, the expansion area ratio εis de fined as the ratio of the projected area of the contoured nozzle wall to the area of the throat ( At)."
What is the relationship between the projected area of the central body and the exit plane area of the nozzle?," The projected area of the contoured nozzle wall, in turn, is the area of the nozzle at the exit plane (Ae)m i n u st h ep r o j e c t e da r e ao ft h ec e n t r a lb o d y( Ap). Therefore ε equivalent Ae - Ap At The preceding figure indicates the values of the annular diameter ratio, Dp/Dt, where Dpis the diameter of the central body, and Dtis the diameter of the throat of an equivalent nozzle having a circular cross section."
What advantage do annular nozzles have over conventional nozzles regarding the behavior of exhaust gas pressure during flow detachment?," The value of annular diameter ratio makes it possible to compare an annular nozzle with a conventional (conical or bell-shaped) nozzle. Annular nozzles are not subject to losses which affect nozzles of the bell or conical type. This is because, in nozzles of the latter type, the exhaust gas may expand to pressures which are considerably smaller than the ambient pressure before the gas flow detaches from the nozzle wall."
What effect does over-expansion have on thrust performance at elevated altitudes?," This over-expansion results in thrust losses at high altitudes. The property of annular nozzles which avoids an over-expansion of the exhaust gas flow is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5], for an E-D (expansion-de flection) nozzle. This figure illustrates an E-D nozzle operating at low altitudes (left) and at high altitudes (right)."
What does the point C represent in relation to the central body of the nozzle?," In this figure, pbindicates the pressure at the back face of the central body of the nozzle. The value of pbdepends on the value of the ambient pressure p0,a n di su s u a l l ys m a l l e rt h a nt h a to f p0.T h ep o i n tCi n d i c a t e st h es h o u l d e ro ft h e central body. The dashed line CD is a line of constant Mach number."
What factors influence the flow characteristics downstream of point D in relation to the nozzle contour?," Downstream of the throat, the exhaust gas expands unaffected around the shoulder C of the central body as long as its pressure at the wall is greater than pb.A f t e rt h eg a se x p a n d sf r o m the throat to the point D along the line CD, the flow downstream of D depends on the nozzle contour DE, and also on the pressure pb,w h o s ev a l u ea f f e c t st h ef r e es t r e a m surface of the boundary of the inner jet."
How does a curved wall affect the pressure of gas flow at low altitudes?," The gas flow is de flected by the contour of the curved wall, and therefore is subject to compression, which increases the pressure at the wall. This increase in wall pressure at low altitudes is shown on the left-hand 98 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly side of the preceding figure. At such altitudes, the exhaust gas remains attached to the wall, as is the case with a conical or bell-shaped nozzle."
What happens to gas flow at high altitudes when the pressure value decreases significantly?," By contrast, at high altitudes, the value of pbbecomes so low, that the gas flow deviates towards the central body. This deviation is shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure. In such conditions, a shock wave may occur, or the gas flow may continue unaffected up to the exit plane of the nozzle, depending on the flow conditions."
What type of nozzle is illustrated that discharges exhaust gas with a radial inward velocity component?," This decrease in wall pressure at high altitudes is shown on the right-hand side of the same figure. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 36], illustrates a plug (or truncated aerodynamic spike) nozzle, which is an annular nozzle discharging exhaust gas having a radial inward component of velocity."
What is the primary benefit of an aerospike nozzle compared to a bell nozzle regarding performance at varying altitudes?," This figure also shows the better performance of this aerospike nozzle in comparison with a bell nozzle in terms of speci fic impulse. The advantage of the aerospike nozzle over the bell-shaped nozzle resides in its ability to adjust with altitude changes to the static pressure of the free stream. This results in a higher speci fic impulse than that of a bell-shaped nozzle at low altitudes, as shown in the preceding figure."
What structure determines altitude compensation in an aerospike nozzle?," This altitude compensation is due to the shape of the aerospike nozzle, which has a central ramp terminating either in a plug base or in a spike in the centre, and is open to the atmosphere on the sides. An aerospike nozzle having a central ramp terminating in a plug base is shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [ 36]."
How is the central spike of a thrust chamber formed according to the principles of aerodynamic design?," 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 99 The central spike need not be a solid wall, because it can be aerodynamically formed by injecting gases from the engine base, as will be shown below. The exhaust gas is free to expand on the open sides of the nozzle, and to adjust its static pressure with the static pressure of the ambient, which decreases with altitude."
What type of nozzle can operate efficiently at multiple altitudes due to its high area ratio?," Thus, a nozzle of very high area ratio (of high performance in vacuo) can also operate ef ficiently and safely at sea level. By contrast, a bell-shaped nozzle can be designed to be optimum (that is, to operate at its maximum level of ef ficiency) at only one altitude. By maximum level of ef ficiency, we mean the optimal expansion of the combusted gas, which results in the maximum thrust."
What type of nozzle did the command module utilize for optimal gas expansion in the vacuum of space?," For example, the initial stage of the Saturn rocket, which carried the Apollo astronauts to the Moon, had a narrow bell-shaped nozzle to produce an ideal straight-edged column of exhaust gas at sea level. However, the command module, which orbited around the Moon, had a much wider bell-shaped nozzle, which was better suited than the nozzle of the initial stage to the expansion of the combusted gas in the vacuum of space."
What condition causes the term Ae(pe - p0) to equal zero in an aerospike nozzle?," As shown above, in an aerospike nozzle, the static pressure ( pe)o ft h ee x h a u s tg a s is the same as the static pressure ( p0)o ft h ea m b i e n t ,a n dt h e r e f o r et h et e r m Ae(pe - p0)i nt h ee q u a t i o no ft h r u s t( s e eC h a p .1 ,S e c t . 1.1): F= . mve+Ae(pe - p0) reduces to zero."
What type of engine can utilize separate thruster segments for thrust vector control?," In addition, an aerospike engine may also be made of individual thruster segments, which can be turned on or off to provide thrust vector control in order to steer the vehicle [ 37], instead of using one of the techniques described in Sect. 2.2. An aerospike rocket engine was developed by Rockwell Aerospace/Rocketdyne Division of Canoga Park, California."
What type of nozzle did Rocketdyne's aerospike engine feature in its thrust chamber during the 1960s?," In the 1960s, Rocketdyne developed a rounded aerospike engine, whose thrust chamber consisted of a truncated annular spike nozzle, of the radial in- flow type, and a number of discrete combustion chambers arranged around the periphery of the nozzle, so as to discharge their gases along the surface of the nozzle."
What type of rocket engine was developed in 1972 that discharges gases along a rectangular wedge surface instead of a round shape?," Subsequently, in 1972, this design gave rise to a linear aerospike engine, 100 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly where the gases are discharged along the surface of a rectangular wedge rather than around a round spike-shape. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 38], illustrates (left) a normal rocket engine having a bell-shaped nozzle, and (right) the linear aerospike rocket engine designed for the Lockheed-Martin X-33 wing-shaped vehicle, which was a technology demonstrator (cancelled on the 1st of March 2001) for NASA’s “next-generation” of space launch vehicles [ 39]."
What factors influence the efficiency of an aerospike nozzle's performance?," The performance of an aerospike nozzle depends on various factors, such as the shape of the nozzle, the amount of the secondary flow (about 1% of the primary flow), the manner of introducing the secondary flow, and the energy ratio of the secondary flow to the primary. The working principle of an aerospike nozzle can be explained as follows."
What type of combustion chamber and nozzle configuration is described for the rocket engine?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5], illustrates the gas flow, under altitude conditions (that is, high value of the pressure ratio pc/p0), of a rocket engine having a toroidal combustion chamber, an annular throat, and a truncated spike nozzle ending in a circular base. 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 101 The primary flow of the exhaust gas expands along the wall of the nozzle, in the Region 1 of the preceding figure, and generates thrust."
What effect does adding secondary flow to the recirculating flow at the nozzle base have on pressure?," The primary flow continues to expand beyond the base of the nozzle, and gives rise to a subsonic recirculating flow in the Region 2 of the same figure. The pressure acting on the base generates additional thrust. By adding a small amount of secondary flow to the recirculating flow at the base of the nuzzle, the pressure acting on the base is increased further."
What determines the optimum quantity of secondary flow to be added for different nozzle shapes?," There is a limit to this increase in ef ficiency, which determines the optimum amount of secondary flow to be added for each given shape of the nozzle. The outer surface of the primary flow is the boundary of a free stream, and therefore depends on the ambient pressure. This fact provides the property of altitude compensation to the aerospike nozzle illustrated above."
What three types of nozzles are compared regarding thrust coefficient and pressure ratios in the provided graph?," The performance of the gas expansion in nozzles of various types can be expressed by means of a graph of the thrust coef ficient CF(de fined in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.3)v e r s u s the pressure ratio pc/p0of the static pressure in the combustion chamber pcto the ambient pressure p0.I nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et ot h ec o u r t e s yo fN A S A[ 5], we consider the thrust coef ficient CFfor: (a) an ideal nozzle of variable expansion area ratio having the optimum expansion for any value of the pressure ratio pc/p0,( b )a n aerospike nozzle of high area ratio, and (c) a bell-shaped nozzle of high area ratio."
What does the graph indicate about the relationship between thrust coefficient C and pressure ratio for the three nozzle types?," This graph shows that the dashed line of the aerospike nozzle approximates the solid line of the ideal nozzle much better than does the dash-and-dot line of the bell-shaped nozzle. 102 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly The same graph also shows that, for all the three types of nozzle indicated above, the value of the thrust coef ficient CFincreases with the value of the pressure ratio pc/p0."
What are the identified advantages and disadvantages of using aerospike nozzles in rocket engine design?," The choice of an aerospike nozzle instead of a traditional nozzle has important consequences on the design of a rocket engine, particularly in case of multistage rockets. Huzel and Huang [ 5]h a v ei d e n t i fi e df o u ra d v a n t a g e sa n dt h r e ed i s a d v a n t a g e s of aerospike nozzles, in the following order: •shorter length, and therefore reduced mass, for the same performance; •better performance at sea level; •possibility of using the stagnant region in the centre of the nozzle to install gas generators, turbo-pumps, tanks, auxiliary equipment, and turbine gas discharges; •possibility of propelling a rocket vehicle by means of a cluster of engines around ac o n t o u r e dp l u gi n s t e a do fal a r g es i n g l ee n g i n e ,a ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e , due to the courtesy of NASA [ 40]; •higher cooling requirements; •heavier structures in some applications; and •increased dif ficulty of manufacturing."
What is the characteristic that defines the termination point of a scarfed nozzle's lower end?," The following figure shows a cluster of bell nozzles of high expansion area ratio which have been scarfed for the external expansion of their exhaust gases. 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 103 By the way, according to the de finition given by Shyne and Keith [ 41], a scarfed nozzle is a two-dimensional asymmetric nozzle whose lower end (the cowl) is termi- nated at the point where the last characteristic which emanates from the upper nozzle wall (the ramp) intersects the cowl."
What are the two primary uses of aerospike nozzles in rocket technology?," According to Aukerman [ 36], there are two distinct applications for aerospike nozzles: •the first stage of a rocket, where the external expansion of the exhaust gas makes it possible to increase the effective expansion area ratio of the engine, due to the property of altitude compensation; and •the stages operating at high altitudes or in space, where the nozzle can be truncated to a very short length, with minimum detriment of performance."
What was the size range of aerospike engines tested by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne during the 1960s?," According to O’Leary and Beck [ 42], during the 1960s, Pratt & Whitney Rock- etdyne tested numerous aerospike engines, ranging in size from subscale, cold- flow models to a 1.112 ×106Nt h r u s to x y g e n / h y d r o g e ne n g i n e ,w h i c hw a st e s t e da ta test stand in Nevada.

What formula is used to calculate the radius of the nozzle cross section at the throat plane?," 1, Sect. 1.3 ¯CF=F At(pc)ns 104 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly and solving this equation for the area Atof the cross section of the nozzle at the throat plane, there results At=F ¯CF(pc)ns=3.323×106 1.530×6.895×106=0.3150 m2 The radius Rtof the cross section of the nozzle at the throat plane is Rt= ( At π ) 1 2 = ( 0."
What is the value of the radius of the cross section at the exit plane based on the given expansion area ratio?,"3150 3.1416 ) 1 2 =0.3166 m Since the expansion area ratio of the nozzle is ε equivalent Ae/At=14, then the radius of the cross section of the nozzle at the exit plane is Re=ε1 2Rt=141 2×0.3166 =1.185 m The table of Sect. 2.4gives recommended values of the characteristic length L* of a combustion chamber for various combinations of propellants."
What is the equation utilized to calculate the volume of the combustion chamber based on L* and At?," In case of the combination of liquid oxygen with RP-1, this table indicates a value of L* falling in the interval from 1.0 m to 1.3 m. We choose L*=1.143 m. This makes it possible to determine the volume Vcof the combustion chamber by means of the following equation of Sect. 2.4 Vc=L∗At After substituting L*=1."
What is the value of the contraction area ratio when the cross-sectional area of the combustion chamber is denoted as Ac?,"143 m and At=0.3150 m2in the preceding equation, we find Vc=0.3600 m3. As has been shown in Sect. 2.4,t h ev a l u eo ft h ea n g l e θof semi-aperture in the converging portion of the nozzle ranges from 0.3491 rad to 0.7854 rad. We take θ= 0.3491 rad.

What formula is used to calculate the length of the converging portion of a nozzle?,"61 2×0.3166 =0.4005 m 2.4 Con figuration and Design of a Thrust Chamber 105 Since the converging portion of the nozzle is a cone, whose semi-aperture angle is θ=0.3491 rad, then the length Lconvof the converging portion of the nozzle results from the following formula of Sect. 2.4 Lconv=Rt [ /parenleftBig Ac At/parenrightBig1 2 - 1 ] +R ( 1 cosθ - 1 ) tanθ After substituting Rt=0."
What is the formula for calculating the volume of a frustum of a right circular cone?,"3166 m, Ac/At=1.6,R=0.4749 m, and θ=0.3491 rad in the preceding equation, we find Lconv=0.3142 m. Since the volume of a frustum of a right circular cone is1/3πh(R2+Rr+r2), where Randrare the radii of the two circular bases and his the height of the frustum, then the approximate volume Vconvof the converging portion of the nozzle is Vconv=1/3×3."
What is the calculated volume of the cylindrical combustion chamber from the injector to the nozzle's inlet plane?,"1416 ×0.3142 × ( 0.40052+0.4005 ×0.3166 +0.31662 ) =0.1275 m3 This value is approximate, because the rounding at the throat plane and the rounding at the inlet plane of the nozzle are not taken into account. The volume Vcylof the cylindrical combustion chamber, whose length goes from the internal face of the injector to the inlet plane of the nozzle, is Vcyl=Vc - Vconv=0."
What is the total distance from the internal face of the injector to the plane of the throat?,"3600 - 0.1275 =0.2325 m3 The length Lcylof this cylindrical combustion chamber is Lcyl=Vcyl 1.6At=0.2325 1.6×0.3150=0.4613 m The total distance Ltotalfrom the internal face of the injector to the plane of the throat is Ltotal=Lcyl+Lconv=0.4613 +0.3142 =0.7755 m For the diverging portion of the nozzle, we choose a fractional length Lf=80% of aπ/12 rad equivalent conical nozzle."
What is the calculated length of the diverging portion of the nozzle when n equals 80 and the equivalent area ratio is 14?," Therefore, the true length Lnof the diverging portion of the nozzle is Ln=n 100Rt tan 0.2618 [ ε1 2 - 1+1.5 ( 1 cos 0 .2618 - 1 ) ] After substituting n=80,Rt=0.3166 m and ε equivalent Ae/At=14 in the preceding equation, we find Ln=2.642 m.

What factors should be considered when selecting a method for the thrust chamber design?," The choice of one of the methods indicated above depends on the design of the thrust chamber. Huzel and Huang [ 5]s u g g e s ts o m ef a c t o r st ob ec o n s i d e r e df o ra choice. They are indicated below.

What factors influence the cooling requirements and heat flow rate in a combustion chamber?,") which determine the heat fluxes and therefore the cooling requirements.

In case of high pressure in the combustion chamber, combined regenerative and film cooling methods are frequently used. (c) Propellant feed system, which determines the values of pressure in the combus- tion chamber."
What is the cooling method utilized in rocket engines powered by turbo-pumps?," For example, in case of a rocket engine fed by turbo-pumps, a high amount of pressure is available for cooling. This amount can be used for regenerative cooling, in order to force the cooling propellant to flow into the 112 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly cooling tubes before reaching the injector.

What temperature resistance is required for refractory alloys to enable radiative cooling in thrust chambers?," In case of film cooled thrust chambers, materials allowing higher working temperatures are necessary for the purpose of reducing the heat flow rates and therefore the flow rates of the film coolant. The possibility of using radiative cooling depends on the availability of refractory alloys capable of resisting temperatures of 1922 K and more."
How does the selection of a cooling method impact the design of a thrust chamber?," Likewise, the possibility of using ablative cooling depends on the availability of reinforced plastic materials. As a general rule, the choice of cooling method has a deep in fluence on the design of a thrust chamber, and vice versa. An analysis is made below of the heat transfer from the combustion products contained in a thrust chamber and the walls of that chamber."
How does heat transfer occur in the thrust chamber according to the motion of gaseous masses?," Due to the high velocity of the hot gases, the heat transfer occurs through convection, and therefore the heat propagates because of the motion of gaseous masses in the thrust chamber. The heat passes from the moving gas firstly to the stagnant boundary layer along the wall, and then to the wall itself."

The preceding equations give approximate values of the convective heat transfer coef ficient hgon the hot gas side. The calculated value of hgmay be lower than the real value, because a substantial part of combusted gases may transfer heat through radiation, or because a substantial part of gaseous molecules dissociate and then recombine near the wall of the thrust chamber, or because the gas flow is unstable."
What factors might cause the calculated value of hg to exceed its actual value during combustion?," Conversely, the calculated value of hgmay be higher than the real value, because the chemical reactions occurring in the combustion process may be incomplete in the combustion chamber, or because the combusted gases may deposit solid particles, which in turn create insulating layers on the wall of the chamber."
What is the function of the solid carbon deposit in relation to heat transfer in a thrust chamber assembly?," These solid particles are made of carbon, in case of a combination of liquid oxygen with RP-1 (kerosene). This carbon layer increases the thermal insulation of the wall on the hot gas side.

What are the key advantages of the regenerative cooling method in thrust chamber design?,"5Wm - 2K - 1at the exit plane We describe first the regenerative cooling method, because it is the most widely used of all cooling methods, due to its advantages in terms of reliability, durability, and high performance. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43], illustrates a regeneratively cooled thrust chamber for a bell nozzle."
What type of fuel is used in the cooling channels of the Space Shuttle's main engines?," 2.5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 121 The cooling tubes or channels run longitudinally along the wall and carry cryo- genic fuel, which is liquid hydrogen for the main engines of the Space Shuttle. The cryogenic fuel coming from the fuel pump passes through the fuel valve, and then flows downward, that is, toward the exit plane of the nozzle, as indicated by the white arrows in the preceding figure."
What role does cryogenic fuel play in the combustion chamber regarding heat management?," At this plane, the fuel reverses the direction of its motion, and therefore flows upward in a parallel tube, is mixed with liquid oxygen at the top, and is then ignited inside the combustion chamber. The cryogenic fuel removes, by heat convection, the heat due to the burned gas in the combustion chamber and in the nozzle."
"What type of fluid is typically used for cooling in an aerospike engine, and why is it preferred over the oxidiser?"," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 49], illustrates the regenera- tively cooled plug and combustion chamber for an aerospike engine. Usually, the fuel is used as the cooling fluid rather than the oxidiser, because of its higher heat capacity, that is, because of its higher capability of removing heat from the nozzle without vaporising."
"What type of fuel does the Saturn V F-1 engines utilize, and how does it differ from cryogenic fuels in terms of cooling the nozzle?"," In addition, the fuel, when heated, requires a smaller supply of energy, acquired through ignition, in order to be burned in the presence of the oxidiser. The heat removal for the Saturn V F-1 engines was slightly different from that described above, because these engines burned kerosene, which is not a cryogenic fuel, but is still capable of cooling a nozzle."
Describe the flow pattern of kerosene in the cooling system of the thrust chamber assembly.," The kerosene came down from the top to the bottom in one tube, turned around, and came back up in the parallel tube. The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43], illustrates a cross- section of the wall of a thrust chamber, having tubes (left) or rectangular channels (right). 122 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Additional information (taken from [ 50]) is given below on the regenerative cooling system used for each of the three liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen main engines of the Space Shuttle."
Which components comprise the main combustion chamber of the RS-25 engine?," The same method has also been successfully used for the Thor, Jupiter, Atlas, H-1, J-2, F-1, RS-27, and several other US Air Force and NASA rocket engines. The main combustion chamber of the RS-25 engine of the Space Shuttle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 51]. This combustion chamber includes a liner, a jacket, a throat ring, a coolant inlet manifold, and a coolant outlet manifold."
How many milled slots are present on the liner's outer surface?," The outer surface of the liner has 430 milled slots, which are closed out by electro-deposited nickel. The jacket halves are placed around the liner and welded. The coolant manifolds are welded to the jacket and the liner. The throat ring is welded to the jacket to add strength to the main combustion chamber."
What materials are primarily used in the construction of the combustion chamber liner?," This creates a regeneratively-cooled combustion chamber, in which the 2.5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 123 cooling fuel makes a single up-pass through the milled slots of the liner. The liner is made of NARloy Z (North American Rockwell alloy Z), which is mostly copper, with silver and zirconium added."
"What materials are used in the construction of the nozzle, and how many tubes are incorporated in its design?"," The nozzle of the same engine is shown in the following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 51]. This nozzle consists of 1800 stainless steel tubes brazed to themselves and to a structural jacket. Nine hatbands are welded around the jacket for hoop strength. Coolant manifolds are welded to the top and to the bottom of the nozzle, along with three fuel transfer ducts and six drain lines."
How many points does the fuel enter the nozzle coolant inlet manifolds?," This nozzle is cooled by the fuel, which enters the diffuser and splits to flow to the main combustion chamber, to the three fuel transfer ducts, and through the chamber coolant valve to the mixer. Fuel flowing through each transfer duct splits at each steer-horn to enter the nozzle coolant inlet manifolds at six points."
What component prevents hot exhaust gas from damaging the seal between the combustion chamber and nozzle?," The fuel then makes a single up-pass through the 1080 tubes to the outlet mani- fold, and then to the mixer, to join the bypass flow from the chamber coolant valve. The flow recirculation inhibitor is a porous rope-like barrier, which prevents a recir- culating flow of hot exhaust gas from reaching and damaging the bellows seal located at the joint between the main combustion chamber and the nozzle."
"What materials compose the flow recirculation inhibitor, and what is their maximum temperature resistance?"," This flow recir- culation inhibitor is a sleeve of braided Nextel®321 filled with Saf fil®batting. Both materials, which are composed of silica-glass ceramic fibre, can withstand working temperatures of up to 1700 K. The materials provide the required resistance to flow. 124 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly By the way, the thermal protection system used in the nozzle is an insulation system which protects the nozzle from high temperatures during launch and re- entry."
"What two phases expose the nozzles to significant thermal stress, and what specific heating mechanisms are involved during these phases?"," During the ascent phase, the three nozzles are subject to plume radiation and convection from the three main engines and to plume radiation from the solid rocket boosters. During the re-entry phase, two of the nozzles are exposed to high heat loads due to convective aerodynamic heating. In the following part of this paragraph, we consider in further depth the heat transfer through convection between the hot gas which moves on one side of the thrust chamber and the coolant fluid which moves on the other side."
"What are the temperatures represented by Taw, Twg, Twc, and Tco in relation to the heat transfer process?"," This heat passes through a series of contiguous layers, including the boundary layer along the wall on the side of the combusted gas, the thickness of the wall, and the boundary layer along the wall on the side of the coolant fluid, as shown in the following figure. Let hgc(W m - 2K - 1)b et h eh e a tt r a n s f e rc o e f fi c i e n to nt h eh o tg a ss i d e , hc(W m - 2K - 1) be the heat coef ficient on the coolant side, q(W/m2)b et h eh e a t fl u x , Taw,Twg,Twc, andTco(K) be the temperatures of respectively the hot gas at the adiabatic wall, the wall on the hot gas side, the wall on the coolant side, and the coolant, k(W m - 1 K - 1)b et h et h e r m a lc o n d u c t i v i t yo ft h ew a l l , t(m) be the thickness of the wall, and H(W m - 2K - 1)b et h eo v e r a l lh e a tt r a n s f e rc o e f fi c i e n t ."
What is the relationship between heat transfer coefficients and temperatures in a steady-state heat transfer scenario?,"I nt h ea b s e n c eo fd e p o s i t s on the hot gas side, hgcandhghave the same value. In the steady state, the heat transfer equations can be expressed as follows q=hgc ( Taw - Twg ) =k t ( Twg - Twc ) =hc(Twc - Tco)=H(Taw - Tco) where the overall heat transfer coef ficient Hresults from H= ( 1 hgc+t k+1 hc ) - 1 The coolant increases its temperature from its point of entry into to its point of exit from the cooling channel, depending on the heat absorbed and its rate of flow."
What is the temperature range for the wall on the hot gas side of combustion chambers according to Huzel and Huang?," The metals commonly used for the walls of combustion chambers are stainless steel, 2.5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 125 nickel, and Inconel®,t h el a s to ft h e mb e i n gah i g h - p e r f o r m a n c ea u s t e n i t i cn i c k e l - chromium-based alloy. According to Huzel and Huang [ 5], the temperature of the wall on the hot gas side is about 1089–1255 K, and the difference of temperature between the combusted gas and the wall ranges from 1644 to 3589 K."
How does the overall heat transfer coefficient affect the heat flux in layered systems?," The equations written above show that the heat flux qis the same for the three layers and depends on the temperatures and on the overall heat transfer coef ficient H.T h ev a l u eo f H, in turn, depends on the individual heat transfer coef ficients relating to the boundary layers and to the wall. Since q=H(Taw - Tco), then a small value of Himplies a small value of q."
What needs to be lower than the values of hc and t/k according to a designer's primary objective?,"I t is a primary objective for a designer to keep the value of hgclower than the values ofhcandt/k.B ys od o i n g ,t h e r ew i l lb eah i g h e rt e m p e r a t u r ed r o p Taw - Twgin the boundary layer on the hot gas side, as shown in the preceding figure, than the temperature drops ( Twg - TwcandTwc - Tco)i n ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,t h ew a l la n dt h e boundary layer on the coolant side."
What factors influence the heat transfer coefficient on the coolant side?," The value of the heat transfer coef ficient hcon the coolant side depends on several factors, such as possible chemical reactions of dissociation occurring in the coolant, its pressure, and its bulk temperature. It also depends on a possible formation of bubbles due to a coolant boiling near the wall."
What conditions must be met for the coolant to have effective heat absorption without reaching boiling?," In order to achieve a good heat- absorbing capacity of the coolant, the pressure and the velocity of the coolant in its flow are selected so that a boiling is permitted locally, but the bulk of the coolant does not reach the boiling condition [ 2]. In the absence of boiling, at subcritical temperatures, and in transitional or turbulent regime (in the interval 3000 ≤Re≤ 106), the relation between the wall temperature and the heat flux, which depends on the heat transfer coef ficient hc,c a nb ee x p r e s s e da p p r o x i m a t e l yb yu s i n go n eo ft h e following three equations due to Taler [ 52,p a g e4 ,E q s ."

What is the formula for calculating the hydraulic diameter of a duct in terms of cross-sectional area and perimeter?," Some authors (see, for example, [ 54], Table 12, and [ 55], Table 8) have proposed other equations, which also express the relation between the wall temperature and the heat flux. By hydraulic diameter of a duct, we mean the quantity d=4A/P,w h e r e A(m2)i s the cross-sectional area of the duct, and P(m) is the perimeter of the wetted portion of its cross section."
What is the value of the heat transfer coefficient estimated by the correlation provided by McCarthy and Wolf when hydrogen is the coolant in supercritical conditions?," When the heat is transferred through a vapour- film boundary layer, for example, when the coolant is hydrogen in supercritical conditions of pressure and temperature, then the value of hc(W m - 2K - 1)c a nb ee s t i m a t e db ym e a n so ft h ef o l l o w i n g correlation due to McCarthy and Wolf [ 56,p a g e9 5 ,E q ."

What is the reason for keeping the coolant's bulk temperature below a certain threshold in a regenerative cooling system?," As mentioned above, the bulk temperature of the coolant should be kept below the critical value, because the value of the heat transfer coef ficient of the vapour- film boundary layer would be too low to cool effectively the wall. The cooling capacity Qc(W) of a liquid coolant used in a regenerative cooling system can be estimated by means of the following equation [ 5]: Qc= ."

The allowed value of the total heat transfer rate Q(W) from the hot gas to the wall must be less than the 2."
What is the reason hydrogen is not affected by the cooling capacity limitation in thrust chamber cooling?,"5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 127 cooling capacity Qc(that is, Q<Qc)o ft h ec o o l a n tb yam a r g i ni m p o s e db ys a f e t y . This limitation does not affect hydrogen when used as a coolant fluid, because of its high transfer coef ficient even in supercritical conditions of pressure and temperature."
What design consideration is required for the coolant passage in the thrust chamber to maintain appropriate velocity?, Hydrogen enters the coolant passage of the thrust chamber at supercritical pressure and reaches its supercritical temperature at a short distance from the inlet section. The cross-section areas of the coolant passage at various points along the wall of the thrust chamber must be designed to maintain the coolant velocity imposed by the heat transfer coef ficient determined by the calculation.
What are the two design options for cooling jackets based on engine thrust?," Possible design choices for the cooling jacket include longitudinal tubes (for engines whose thrust is equal to or greater than 13,400 N) and coaxial shells separated by helical ribs or wires (for engines of smaller thrust). In the latter case, the coolant passage is the rectangular area limited by the inner shell, the outer shell, and two adjacent ribs."
What factors influence the number of tubes for coolant fluid in tubular thrust chambers?," The ribs are wrapped helically around the inner shell. In case of thrust chambers of tubular shape, such as those described in Sect. 2.4,t h e number of tubes for the coolant fluid depends on factors such as the size of the thrust chamber, the mass flow rate of the coolant for unit area of the tubes, the maximum allowable stress for the material of which the tubes are made, and manufacturing considerations."
"Where in a thrust chamber is the heat flux at its highest, influencing cooling tube requirements?"," The region of a thrust chamber which needs the maximum cooling is the throat, because there the heat flux qis also maximum. Therefore, the cooling requirements at the throat determine the number of cooling tubes for a given flow rate of the coolant used. The cross section of the cooling tubes is often circular, for easiness of manufacturing and lower stress."
What kinds of stresses affect cooling tubes due to the pressure and temperature differences?," The mechanical and thermal stresses acting on the cooling tubes are induced by the pressure exerted by the coolant, and by the difference of temperature between the tubes and the wall. In addition, since two adjacent tubes may be subject to different pressures, then distorting stresses may also arise."
What factors are included in the formula for calculating maximum combined tensile stress in a circular cooling tube?," As has been shown above, the region of a thrust chamber subject to the maximum stress is the throat. In order to evaluate the maximum combined tensile stress σt(N/m2)a c t i n go n the cross section A-A of a circular cooling tube, as shown on the left-hand side of 128 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly the preceding figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5], Huzel and Huang [ 5]i n d i c a t e the following formula σt= ( pco - pg ) r t+Eλqt 2(1 - ν)k+6MA t2 where pco(N/m2)i st h ep r e s s u r eo ft h ec o o l a n t , pg(N/m2)i st h ep r e s s u r eo ft h e combusted gas, r(m) is the radius of the cross section of the cooling tubes, t(m) is the thickness of the cooling tubes, E(N/m2)i st h em o d u l u so fe l a s t i c i t yo ft h e material of which the cooling tubes are made, λ(m m - 1K - 1)i st h ec o e f fi c i e n to f thermal expansion of the same material, q(W/m2)i st h eq u a n t i t yo fh e a tp e ru n i tt i m e per unit surface, νis the Poisson ratio of the same material, k(W m - 1K - 1)i st h e thermal conductivity of the same material, and MA(Nm/m) is the bending moment per unit length acting at the section A-A due to the distortion induced by difference of pressure between adjacent cooling tubes or by other effects, such as discontinuities."
What factor primarily contributes to the bending moment per unit length in tubes with circular cross sections?," In case of tubes of circular cross section, the bending moment per unit length MA is caused only by discontinuity, because there is no effect of difference of pressure between adjacent tubes [ 5]. With reference to the preceding figure, the mean temperature in the zone I (which is on the side of the combusted gas) of each cooling tube is much higher than the mean temperature in the zone II (which is on the side of the outer shell)."
What determines the critical stress relating to longitudinal inelastic buckling in the cooling tube?," Therefore, the thermal expansion of the cooling tube in zone I is restrained by the low temperature in zone II. Since the mass in zone II is greater than the mass in zone I, then thermal inelastic buckling can arise in zone I in the longitudinal direction. The thermal stress σ(N/m2)i nt h el o n g i t u d i n a ld i r e c t i o na n dt h ec r i t i c a ls t r e s s σc(N/m2)r e l a t i n gt ot h e longitudinal inelastic buckling may be evaluated by using the following equations [5]: σ=Eλ∆T σc=4EtEct (E1 2 tE1 2c)2 [ 3 ( 1 - ν2 ) ] 1 2r where ∆T(K) is the mean difference of temperature between zone I and zone II, Et (N/m2)i st h et a n g e n t i a lm o d u l u so fe l a s t i c i t ya tt h ew a l lt e m p e r a t u r e ,a n d Ec(N/m2) is the tangential modulus of elasticity from the compression stress-strain curve at the wall temperature."

The equations written above can also be applied for the purpose of computing the stresses in such tubes. The maximum combined stress acts in the section A-A."
What additional factors must be considered alongside discontinuities to compute the bending moment per unit length at section A-A?," The bending moment per unit length M′A(Nm/m) acting at this section should be computed by taking into account not only the effect of discontinuities, but also the difference of pressure between adjacent tubes, as follows 2.5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 129 M′ A=MA+KAℓ∆p 2 where MA(Nm/m) is the bending moment per unit length acting on the section A-A due only to discontinuity, KAis a dimensionless constant whose value is in the range 0."

What materials are used for the outer skin of the thrust chamber designed by Edward Baehr?," This thrust chamber, which was designed in 1957 by Edward Baehr, consists of a number of longitudinal channels of varying depth according to the velocity required for the coolant. These channels are bonded together to make up the chamber and bound by stainless steel wire wrapping which is brazed to make a fluid-tight and strong outer skin."
What types of stress are experienced by the inner shell of the thrust chamber assembly?," In a thrust chamber of this type, the outer skin (the brazed wire) is 130 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly subject only to the hoop stress due to the pressure exerted by the coolant. The inner shell is subject to the mechanical stress is due to the difference of pressure existing between the combusted gas and the coolant, and also to the thermal stress due to the heat transfer across the wall."

What practices are recommended to minimize pressure drop in the coolant fluid of a rocket engine?," Since the heat transfer in a rocket engine occurs mainly through convection, it is desirable to reduce the pressure drop of the coolant fluid to the minimum possible value. For this purpose, it is necessary to avoid abrupt changes in the direction of the coolant fluid and also in the hydraulic diameter of the tubes."
What does the Darcy-Weisbach equation express regarding pressure drop in terms of hydraulic diameter and friction factor?," In addition, the inner surfaces of these tubes should be smooth and clean. The pressure drop ∆p(N/m2)i n at u b eo fl e n g t h L(m) and hydraulic diameter d(m) is expressed as a function of the Darcy friction factor fD(dimensionless) of the tube by means of the Darcy-Weisbach equation, as follows ∆p=fDL d ( 1 2 rho v2 ) where rho (kg/m3)a n d vare respectively the density and the average velocity of the coolant flowing in the tube."

What type of design is chosen for the cooling tubes that involves a partial pass starting below the throat?,"82055 which con firms the value Pr=0.82 found above. A sesqui-pass (literally one-and- a-half-pass) type of design is chosen here for the cooling tubes. This term actually means a partial pass starting below the throat. This type of pass is used with coolants (such as liquid hydrogen) which must previously be heated in order to become effec- tive, that is, in order to absorb the high heat fluxes at the throat."
What factors impact the partial pass extent according to the thermal and gimballing requirements?," The extent of the partial pass results from a trade-off between thermal and gimballing requirements, since it is desirable to keep the inlet manifold forward [ 45]. As has been shown above, the number Nof cooling tubes can be determined as follows N=π[Dt+0.8(d+2t)] d+2t=π[0.2850 +0.8×(d+2×0.0002 )] d+2×0."

By substituting this value of Ninto the preceding equation, there results d=0.003307 m. Therefore, the cooling system at the throat consists of 244 tubes, each of which is 3.307 mm in diameter and 0.2 mm in thickness. The estimated pressure of the coolant at the throat is pco=8."

What is the maximum allowable bending moment per unit length resulting from discontinuity in the Thrust Chamber Assembly?," After substituting these values in the preceding equation, we find σt=0.4279 ×108+5.397×108+1.500×108MA By keeping σtless than or equal to the 0.2% offset tensile yield strength, which isσty=1.06 ×109N/m2at the temperature T=675 K, as recommended by the manufacturer of Inconel®718 [ 61], the maximum allowable bending moment per unit length due to discontinuity results 142 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly (MA)max=(10."
What is the calculated bending moment due to discontinuity as stated by Huzel and Huang?,"6 - 0.4279 - 5.397)×108 1.500×108=3.183 Nm/m According to Huzel and Huang [ 5], the value of the bending moment due to discontinuity is, in the present case, smaller than 0.583 Nm/m, as shown by expe- rience. Therefore, the results found above (at the throat plane, 244 tubes, each of which is 3.183 mm in diameter and 0."
What aspect of the cooling tubes in a thrust chamber varies along its longitudinal axis?,"2 mm in thickness) are con firmed. The results found in the two preceding examples concern the size of the cooling tubes at the throat, which is narrowest section of a thrust chamber. The size of the tubes changes along the longitudinal axis of a thrust chamber. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 45], shows a cooling tube having a circular cross section of variable size with 6:1 maximum taper."
What method is typically used to join the cooling tubes to each other and to the metal shell?," Another option consists in bifurcating the tubes by means of joints, as shown in the following figure, which is also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 45]. 2.5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 143 The cooling tubes are brazed to each other and to a metal shell or to hatbands for stiffening. To this end, furnace brazing is usually applied."
What type of welding has Volvo Aero Corporation employed to join the tubes to the inner wall of the nozzle?," In order to avoid the necessity of tapering, Volvo Aero Corporation has used tubes of square cross-section, which are wrapped in a spiral pattern around the inner wall of the nozzle. They are joined by gas-tungsten arc fillet welds [ 63]. Volvo Aero Corporation has also used a manufacturing process which consists in laser welding a close-out cover sheet on to an inner wall with milled cooling channels."
What shape does the part achieve after the outer sheet is fused to the inner sheet?," When the outer sheet is laser welded to the inner sheet, the part has the form of a straight cone. Successively, the forming of ab e l l - s h a p e dc o n t o u ri sd o n eb ye x p a n s i o ni nac o n v e n t i o n a le x p a n d e r[ 64]. As has been shown above, the dump cooling method is similar to the regenerative cooling, because the coolant flows, for both of these methods, through small passages on the outer side of the thrust chamber."
What is the static absolute pressure limit for using dump cooling in rocket engines powered by hydrogen?," However, in the case of dump cooling, the coolant is discharged overboard through openings at the end plane of the divergent portion of the nozzle, instead of flowing back to be discharged into the injector. This method is used in rocket engines fuelled by hydrogen at low pressures ( pc< 689500 N/m2,w h e r e pcis the static absolute pressure in the combustion chamber)."
What are the four configurations through which coolant can flow from the injector plane to the exit plane?," The heated hydrogen dumped overboard gives a contribution to the total thrust. The coolant, if flowing longitudinally from the injector plane to the exit plane, can pass either in the interstice between a double wall (case A) or in tubes running along a single wall (case C). The coolant, if flowing spirally from the injector plane to the exit plane, can pass either in spiral passages existing between a double wall (case B) or in tubes wound around a single wall (case D), before being dumped overboard in the axial direction."
What is the purpose of using a protective film in the film cooling method?," The four cases described above are illustrated in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5]. As has been shown above, film cooling method consists in the protection of a given surface from the harmful effects of a stream of hot gas by interposing a continuous protective film between the surface and the stream."
What method is used to inject coolant into the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant engine?," In a liquid-propellant engine, a liquid or gaseous coolant, which is usually the fuel, is injected tangentially or at low angles into the combustion chamber along the hot gas side of the wall by means of ar o wo fs l o t so ro r i fi c e s ,a ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et ot h ec o u r t e s yo f NASA [ 65]."
How does the thickness of the coolant film change in relation to the hot stream?," 144 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Due to phenomena of heat and mass transfer between the coolant film and the combusted gas, the thickness of the coolant film decreases in the direction of the hot stream. Therefore, in case of need, further coolant is injected through additional holes placed downstream of those placed along the first row."
What is the state of the coolant at the moment of injection in film cooling?," Film cooling is sometimes used in conjunction with regenerative cooling, for the purpose of reducing the heat transfer through the wall and, therefore, the thermal stress of the materials. The coolant is often in the liquid state at the moment of injection, in order to absorb heat from the combusted gas by evaporating and diffusing into the main stream."
What does Gc represent in the film cooling design of the thrust chamber?," This injection gives rise to a liquid film placed around the wall of the combustion chamber and containing the gaseous stream. The cooling ef ficiency of the injected fuel is subject to losses, due to disturbance waves on the surface of the liquid film adjacent to the combusted gas.

What does the variable Tco represent in the cooling of a thrust chamber?,"5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 145 of the coolant in the liquid phase, Taw(K) is the temperature of the gas at the adiabatic wall, Twg(K) is the temperature of the wall on the hot gas side and also the temperature of the coolant film, Tco(K) is the bulk temperature of the coolant at the manifold, ∆Hvc(J/kg) is the vaporisation heat of the coolant, a=2Vd/(Vmf),Vd (m/s) is the velocity of the stream of combusted gas in the axial direction at the edge of the boundary layer, Vm(m/s) is the average velocity of the stream of combusted gas in the axial direction, fis the friction coef ficient for the two-phase flow between the combusted gas and the liquid film, b=Vg/Vd–1 ,Vg(m/s) is the velocity of the velocity of the stream of combusted gas in the axial direction at the central line of the thrust chamber, c=cpvc/cpg,a n d cpg(J kg - 1K - 1)i st h ea v e r a g es p e c i fi ch e a ta t constant pressure of the combusted gas."

These values are to be determined exper- imentally. Hydrocarbon fuels have proven to be effective when used as coolants, because of the heat insulation properties of the carbon deposits generated by them on the walls of a thrust chamber."
What is the relationship between the temperatures of the gas at the wall and the maximum allowable wall temperature in a thrust chamber?," When liquid hydrogen is used as a fuel, the very low critical temperature of hydrogen ( Tc=33.18 K, according to [ 62]) causes the initially liquid film to evaporate at a short distance from the point of injection.

The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 68]s h o w sa3 7 - e l e m e n t injector with removable film coolant ring manifold used in a small hydrogen-oxygen thrust chamber cooled by means of a hydrogen film."
What factors influence the heat originating from the wall of the combustion chamber in the Thrust Chamber Assembly?, 146 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly The Hatch-Papell equation written above is based on the assumption of a balance between the heat coming from the wall of the combustion chamber and the heat absorbed by the coolant. The heat coming from the wall depends on the heat transfer hgcoef ficient on the hot gas side and also on the difference between the temperature Tawof the gas at the adiabatic wall and the initial temperature Tcoof the coolant.
How does the temperature of the coolant change along the flow axis in the thrust chamber?," The heat absorbed by the coolant depends on the heat capacity of the coolant in the interval from the initial temperature to the final temperature. When the two amounts of heat are in equilibrium, no heat is transferred through the wall. In such conditions, the inner surface of the thrust chamber reaches the temperature of the coolant corresponding to the particular location along the flow axis."
How is the mass flow rate of the coolant determined for the wall of the thrust chamber in a rocket engine?," Therefore, the temperature of the inner surface of the thrust chamber increases from the initial temperature of the coolant at the point of injection to the maximum allowable value of the temperature, at which point a further injection of coolant becomes necessary. As an example of application, it is required to determine the mass flow rate Gc (kg s - 1m - 2)o f fi l mc o o l a n tp e ru n i ta r e ao ft h ew a l lo ft h et h r u s tc h a m b e rt ob e cooled, for a rocket engine burning a combination of liquid hydrogen (fuel) with liquid fluorine (oxidiser)."
What is the heat transfer coefficient on the hot gas side at the throat plane?," At the throat plane, the following quantities are known: heat transfer coef ficient on the hot gas side hg=3238 W m - 2K - 1,t e m p e r a t u r eo f the gas at the adiabatic wall Taw=2911 K, maximum allowable temperature of the wall on the hot gas side Twg=1056 K, initial temperature of the coolant Tco=28 K, 2."
What is the calculated value of Gc based on the given parameters and the Hatch-Papell equation?,"5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 147 average speci fic heat at constant pressure of the gaseous coolant Cpvc=1.507 ×104 Jk g - 1K - 1,a n de f fi c i e n c yo ft h e fi l mc o o l i n g ηc=0.3. By substituting these data into the Hatch-Papell equation Taw - Twg Taw - Tco=exp ( - hg GcCpvcηc ) and solving for Gc, there results Gc= - 3238 1."
How is the temperature of the adiabatic wall adjusted before calculating heat flux for a regeneratively cooled engine?,"507×104×0.3×ln ( 2911 - 1056 2911 - 28 ) =1.624 kg s - 1m - 2 When the heat flux q(W/m2), that is, the quantity of heat transferred per unit time per unit surface, is computed for a regeneratively cooled engine with added film cooling, then it is necessary to modify the value of the temperature Taw(K) of the adiabatic wall, before using this value in the equation q=hg(Taw–Twg)o r in the equation q=hgc(Taw–Twg)."
"How should the modified value of Tawm be established, and what is required for the heat transfer coefficient on the hot gas side?"," The modi fied value of Tawmust be determined experimentally. By contrast, it is not necessary to modify the value of the heat transfer coef ficient hgorhgc(W m - 2K - 1)o nt h eh o tg a ss i d e . As has been shown at the beginning of this paragraph, in case of transpiration cooling, the wall to be cooled has drilled holes or is made of a porous material, in order for the coolant to pass through the wall into the gas flow."
What forms on the gas side of the wall that insulates it from heat carried by combusted gas?," A protective layer builds up on the hot gas side of the wall and insulates it from the heat carried by the stream of combusted gas, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 69]. Since the coolant is directed away from the surface when leaving the wall, then ac o u n t e r fl o wi sg e n e r a t e db e t w e e nt h eh e a tc a r r i e da w a yf r o mt h es u r f a c ew i t ht h e coolant stream and the heat transferred from the stream of combusted gas toward the wall."
What equation is used to evaluate cooling efficiency in the thrust chamber assembly?," This counter flow reduces the overall heat transfer between the hot gas and the surface of the wall [ 69]. The permeable inner liner of the thrust chamber is enclosed into an outer shell, and forms a jacket from which the coolant comes. 148 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly The cooling ef ficiency ( Tg–Tw)/(Tg–Tc)c a nb ee v a l u a t e db yu s i n gt h eR a n n i e equation [ 70], as follows Tg - Tw Tg - Tco=1 - exp ( - 36."

What cooling efficiency value is recommended by Huzel and Huang for transpiration-cooled thrust chambers?," Since the Rannie equation written above indicates coolant flows slightly lower than those found necessary in experiments, then Huzel and Huang [ 5]r e c o m m e n dt o use a cooling ef ficiency value of about 0.85. The porous material used for the walls of transpiration-cooled thrust chambers must, of course, withstand the mechanical and thermal stresses acting on such walls."
What materials are commonly used in ablative cooling for wall protection?," As has been shown above, ablative cooling is performed by using a protective material which covers the inner surface of a wall to be cooled. This material is made of either epoxy or, more often, phenolic resins reinforced by fibres. The protective material thermally degrades, and the products of this degradation (an endothermal pyrolysis of the resin, which leaves a pure carbon solid, called char, and releases oxygen and hydrogen) are carried away by the main stream of hot gas."
What materials are used for the insulation layer in an ablatively-cooled thrust chamber?," The process of ablation blocks the heat flux to the outer surface of the wall. The reinforcement of the resin consists of either fibre-woven fabrics or chopped fibres of materials such as silica, graphite, or carbon. With reference to the following figure, adapted from [ 71], an ablatively-cooled thrust chamber consists of a flame liner (made of a reinforced phenolic resin), a thin layer (made of silica impregnated with a phenolic resin) used for for insulation, and ah i g h - s t r e n g t hs t r u c t u r a ls h e l l ."

What design strategy is employed for throat insert joints to minimize leak paths to the structural outer shell?," When several liner components are used, especially for the throat inserts, then joints are staggered axially to prevent a direct leak path to the outer structural shell. Such joints are located where they are not likely to open up under the action of thermal or mechanical loads. A differential thermal expansion of the components is taken into account by using materials having compatible elastic moduli or by inserting crushable or flexible materials which can expand without excessive stresses induced by strain [ 71]."
What factors influence the calculation of char depth in an ablative cooled thrust chamber according to Huzel and Huang's experimental findings?," The structural shell is made of either fibreglass or aluminium alloy or stainless steel. The thermal resistance of the inner layers keeps the outer shell at moderate temperatures. For the design of a thrust chamber cooled by ablative materials, Huzel and Huang [5]i n d i c a t et h ef o l l o w i n ge q u a t i o nf o u n de x p e r i m e n t a l l y ,w h i c he x p r e s s e st h ec h a r depth a(m) as a function of the heat absorbed: a=c/braceleftbigg2kt RrRvcp rho ln [ 1+RrRvcp(Taw - Td) Lp ] /bracerightbigg0."

What is the value of 'a' obtained when inserting b=0.0008509 m/s^1/2 and ε into the given equation?,"5 [ (pc)ns 6.895×105 ] 0.4 we find a=0.021 m =2.10 cm. Likewise, by inserting b=0.0008509 m/s 1/2 andε=5i nt h ef o l l o w i n ge q u a t i o n a=bt1 2exp( - 0.0247 ε) we find a=0.0152 m =1.52 cm. Radiation cooling occurs in a combustion chamber having a thin wall which is heated by the combusted gas to a temperature of thermal equilibrium."
What type of material is required to prevent overheating of the wall's inner surface from combusted gas?," At this temperature, the heat from the wall to space equals the heat from the combusted gas to the wall. In order to prevent the inner surface of the wall from being overheated by the combusted gas, materials having high thermal conductivity are necessary. The limits of application of radiation cooling depend on the maximum temperature which the available materials can withstand."
What factors influence the temperature of combusted gas in a combustion chamber?," The temperature of the combusted gas 2.5 Cooling of a Thrust Chamber 151 in a combustion chamber depends on such factors as the thrust level, the burning time, the pressure in the chamber, the combination of propellants, and their mixture ratios. Most portions of radiation cooled engines are subject to temperatures greater than 1500 K, with the exception of extension skirts of nozzles."
"What materials, in addition to graphites, can withstand temperatures above 1500 K in a radiation cooled engine?"," The heat-blocking properties of graphites resulting from pyrolysis of phenolic resins have been described above. Apart from these graphites, the only materials capable of meeting the requirements of a radiation cooled engine at temperatures above 1500 K are refractory materials, such as tungsten, molybdenum, and niobium."
What type of coating is used to protect niobium alloy C-103 in radiation-cooled rocket engines from oxidation?," These materials are subject to oxidation caused by exhaust gases containing water vapour, carbon dioxide, and free oxygen. Therefore, refractory materials to be used in rocket engines must be protected by suitable coatings. So far, radiation-cooled rocket engines have used a niobium alloy (C-103) with af u s e ds i l i c ac o a t i n g( R 5 1 2 E ) ."
What is the operating temperature of the niobium alloy in rocket engines mentioned in the text?,"S i n c et h i sc o a t i n gh a sal i m i t a t i o ni nt e m p e r a t u r e of 1643 K, then fuel film cooling has been necessary in rocket engines using this niobium alloy to maintain this temperature limit.

"What do q, Taw, and Twg represent in the context of heat transfer through a wall?"," Assuming negligible difference of temperature between the alloy and the coating, as c h e m eo fh e a tt r a n s f e rb yr a d i a t i o nc o o l i n gi ns t e a d ys t a t ef o raw a l li si l l u s t r a t e d in the following figure. Letq(W/m2),Taw(K), and Twg(K) be respectively the quantity of heat transferred per unit time per unit surface of the wall, the temperature of the combusted gases at the adiabatic wall, and the temperature of the wall on the gas side."
How is the heat flux from combusted gases related to the temperature difference between Taw and Twg?," As has been shown at the beginning of this section, the heat flux qfrom the combusted gases is proportional to the difference of temperature Taw–Twg, as follows q=hgc ( Taw - Twg ) where hgc(W m - 2K - 1)i st h eo v e r a l lh e a tt r a n s f e rc o e f fi c i e n to nt h eh o tg a ss i d e .

In conditions of thermal equilibrium, the following equation holds hgc ( Taw - Twg ) =εσT4 wg The design of a radiation cooling system consists in determining a value of the temperature Twgof the combusted gases at the adiabatic wall which satis fies the equation written above and meets the requirements posed by the material in the operating conditions."
"What is the wall temperature on the hot gas side for a nozzle extension given the overall heat transfer coefficient, adiabatic wall temperature, and surface emissivity?"," As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to determine the temperature Twgof the wall on the hot gas side for a nozzle extension of a rocket engine such that the overall heat transfer coef ficient on the hot gas side is hgc= 206.6 W/(m2K), the temperature of the combusted gases at the adiabatic wall is Taw =2722 K, and the emissivity of the outer surface of the wall is ε=0."
What is the calculated temperature value Twg rounded to four significant figures?,"95. By substituting these data in the following equation hgc ( Taw - Twg ) =εσT4 wg there results 206.6× ( 2722 - Twg ) =0.95×5.67×10 - 8×T4 wg This equation can be solved numerically for Twg.T h er e s u l t ,w i t hf o u rs i g n i fi c a n t figures, is Twg=1478 K. Consequently, the heat flux on the hot gas side of the wall is q=hgc ( Taw - Twg ) =206."
What is the primary function of injectors in a rocket engine's combustion chamber?,"6×(2722 - 1478 )=2.57×105W/m2 2.6 Injectors The position of a typical injector in the combustion chamber of a rocket engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 49]. 2.6 Injectors 153 As has been shown in Sect. 2.1,t h ei n j e c t o ri st h ep a r to far o c k e te n g i n ei nw h i c h the liquid fuel and the liquid oxidiser are admitted in the combustion chamber, broken up into particles or droplets in order to increase the areas of their contact surfaces, mixed one with the other, and left to vaporise before reacting in the combustion process."
What is necessary for maintaining smooth combustion during both steady state operation and transient phases in injector design?," An injector terminates with a perforated plate which marks the beginning of the combustion chamber. Huzel and Huang [ 5]h a v ei d e n t i fi e ds o m er e q u i r e m e n t st ob et a k e ni n t oa c c o u n t in the design of an injector. They are indicated below. •Stability in the combustion process, meaning by that a smooth combustion not only during the steady state operation but also in the start and stop transients."
What two key conditions must be managed to ensure safe operation during engine ignition and shutdown?," For this purpose, it is necessary to prevent unburned propellants from accumu- lating in the combustion chamber before ignition, in order to avoid an excess of pressure. It is also necessary to maintain a mixture of propellants rich in fuel at the moment of shutting the engine off, in order to avoid overheating."
What device can be placed on the injector face to prevent local detonations caused by combustion instabilities?," The prop- agation of local detonations due to combustion instabilities can be prevented by using damping devices placed either on the injector face (baf fles) or along the wall of the combustion chamber (acoustic liners). Full details on baf fles, acoustic absorbers, and other stabilisation devices are given in Sect."
What factors influence the performance of an injector in the combustion process?," 2.9and also in [ 74]. The correct amount and mixture ratio of propellants are maintained by means of valves. •Performance of an injector in the combustion process, which depends on factors such as distribution of the mass of propellants, local value of the mixture ratio, mixing of the propellants, size and vaporisation of the droplets, heat flow, and velocity of the chemical reactions."
What factor contributes to better performance in injectors within the same combustion chamber volume?," Experience has shown that droplets of small size vaporise at high rates, and therefore injectors having a large number of 154 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly injecting elements have also a better performance, for the same volume of the combustion chamber, than those having a small number. •Thermal and structural integrity of the injector, meaning by that its capability of withstanding the thermal and mechanical loads to which it is subject during the various phases of operation of the engine."
What is essential to prevent injector overheating in a combustion system?," In particular, an adequate system of cooling it is necessary to protect the injector from overheating. •Proper sizing of the ori fices, in order to obtain desired values of droplet size and also of pressure drops at speci fic flow rates. •Protection of the whole combustion chamber from heat, meaning by that a complete mixing of the propellants, in order to avoid the formation of hot spots near the wall."
"How is the mixture ratio adjusted for operation in special conditions, particularly during throttling or non-nominal values?"," To this end, the value of the mixture ratio o/fis kept low near the wall by placing a set of fuel holes around the periphery of the injector. •Capability of operating in special conditions, for example, at low thrust levels during throttling, or at values of the mixture ratio which differ from the nominal values."
What types of substances does the injector introduce into the main combustion chamber?," The working principle of an injector is illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 50], which shows the main injector of the Space Shuttle main engine. This injector admits into the main combustion chamber a combination of hot, fuel- rich gas from the two pre-burners, cold gaseous hydrogen from the cooling circuits, and and cold liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidiser turbo-pump."
How many coaxial elements are contained within the injector mentioned in the passage?," Passageways are formed for these fluids to enter the proper cavities in the injector, by welding the injector into the centre of the hot-gas manifold (HGM). The injector consists 2.6 Injectors 155 of 600 coaxial elements, which inject liquid oxygen from the oxidiser manifold through their centre posts."
What type of gas enters the slot between the secondary plate and the primary plate in this system?," Each element also injects, through its annulus, the hot, fuel-rich gas entering the cavity between the heat shield and the secondary plate. Cold gaseous hydrogen, which had previously migrated through the double walls of the hot-gas manifold, enters the slot between the secondary plate and the lip of the primary plate."
What is the purpose of the flow shields in relation to the outer row of elements?, Both of these plates are porous and are transpiration-cooled by the cold gaseous hydrogen which flows through them. The flow shields are bolted to the outer row of elements and protect them from damage and erosion caused by the high-velocity gas. An augmented spark ignition (ASI) system chamber is located in the centre of the injector.
What initiates the ignition of the propellants flowing through the injector elements in the chamber?," Small quantities of hydrogen and oxygen are continuously injected into this chamber and initially ignited by two spark igniters located therein. This flame then ignites the propellants flowing through the injector elements into the combustion chamber. The thrust cone is a mounting pad for the gimbal bearing, which in turn attaches the engine to the vehicle [ 50]."
What type of injector elements are selected for the combination of liquid oxygen and hydrogen propellants?," The elements of the injector described above are of the coaxial type, which has been chosen because the combination of propellants is liquid oxygen and hydrogen. In order to meet the requirements posed by other combinations of propellants, elements of different types can be chosen, as will be shown below."
What is the term for the configuration where all impingement points maintain a uniform distance from the injector face?," In many cases, the injected streams of propellants are made to impinge at a prede- termined distance from the injector face, in order to obtain a good mixture. The impingement distance depends on the heat transfer conditions. The type of elements in which all impingement points are at the same distance from the injector face is called uni-planar impingement."
What are the two classifications of impingement points based on their distances from the injector face?," The types of elements in which the impingement points are at two and at more than two distances from the injector face are called respectively bi-planar and multi-planar impingement. The angles between impinging streams are usually chosen in the range from 0.3491 rad to 0.7854 rad. The following figures, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 75], show some types of injector elements used for liquid/liquid injection."
What is the primary difference in stream arrangement between doublet and triplet configurations in propellant interaction?," (a) Unlike doublet, in which each stream of oxidiser is made to impinge on each stream of fuel in a pair. In this arrangement, the angle Φbetween the two streams is variable within the range indicated above. It provides a good mixing, but its performance is sensitive to continuous throttling. 156 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly (b) Unlike triplet, in which two streams of one propellant impinge symmetrically on one stream of the other propellant."
What mixing technique is sensitive to continuous throttling and challenging to manifold?," It provides a good mixing, but its performance is sensitive to continuous throttling. (c) Unlike quadruplet, in which two streams of one propellant impinge symmetri- cally on two streams of the other propellant. It can be used near the wall of the combustion chamber, but is dif ficult to manifold. (d) Unlike quintuplet, in which four streams of one propellant impinge symmetri- cally on one stream of the other propellant."
What is the primary challenge associated with the concentric tube injector that has swirling compared to one without swirling?," It provides a good mixing, but is dif ficult to manifold. (e) Concentric tube with swirling, in which two concentric tubes are used to inject coaxially the two propellants, in the presence of a swirling device. It provides a good mixing, but is unstable when throttled. 2.6 Injectors 157 (f) Concentric tube without swirling, in which two concentric tubes are used to inject coaxially the two propellants, without swirling devices."
What enhances mixing between two propellants but necessitates a longer axial distance for fuel and oxidizer interaction?," It has a very good compatibility with the wall of the combustion chamber, but provides a poor mixing. (g) Like doublet, in which two streams of one propellant are made to impinge on two streams of the other propellant. It provides a good mixing, but requires an increased axial distance to mix the fuel with the oxidiser."
What is the method of mixing propellants in a combustion chamber using non-impinging streams?," (h) Shower head, in which non-impinging streams of oxidiser and fuel enter the combustion chamber perpendicularly to the injector face. In this arrangement, the mixing of one propellant with the other is due exclusively to the turbulence in the combustion chamber. It is excellent for boundary layer cooling, but provides ap o o rm i x i n g ."
What is the function of splash plates in the Thrust Chamber Assembly?," 158 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly (i) Variable area (movable pintle). It can be throttled and is simple to manufacture, but poses problems of compatibility with the wall of the combustion chamber. (j) Splash plate, in which the streams of the injected propellants are de flected by splash plates, These plates are kept cool by the impinging liquid propellants, which ignite only after leaving the plates."
What issues arise concerning compatibility with the combustion chamber wall when throttling certain injector elements?," It can be throttled, but poses problems of compatibility with the wall of the combustion chamber. The following figures, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 75], show some types of injector elements used for gas/liquid injection. (a) Unlike triplet, in which two streams of the liquid propellant impinge symmet- rically on one stream of the gaseous propellant."
What is the performance sensitivity of the system when subjected to continual throttling?," It provides a good mixing, but its performance is sensitive to continuous throttling. 2.6 Injectors 159 (b) Unlike quintuplet, in which four streams of the liquid propellant impinge symmetrically on one stream of the gaseous propellant. It provides a good mixing, but its performance is sensitive to continuous throttling."
What is a drawback of using concentric tubes with swirling for propellant injection?," (c) Concentric tube with swirling, in which two concentric tubes are used to inject coaxially the two propellants, in the presence of a swirling device. It provides an excellent mixing, but tends to become unstable when throttled. (d) Concentric tube without swirling, in which two concentric tubes are used to inject coaxially the two propellants, without swirling devices."
"What characteristic of the substance affects its stability when throttled, despite its compatibility with combustion chamber walls?"," It has a very good compatibility with the wall of the combustion chamber, but tends to become unstable when throttled. 160 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly (e) Like doublet, in which two streams of the gaseous (or liquid) propellant are made to impinge on two streams of the same propellant. It provides a good mixing, but requires an increased axial distance to mix the fuel with the oxidiser."
What is the thrust of the Space Shuttle's main engine at sea level?," By throttling of a liquid-propellant rocket engine we mean a the variation of the thrust of that engine with respect to the 100% rated power level. For example, the main engine of the Space Shuttle has a rated power level (100%) of thrust amounting to 2094223 N in vacuo and 1675200 N at the sea level."
What are the three specified levels of thrust and their corresponding percentages in relation to a primary measurement?," This thrust can be varied from 1408307 N (67%) to 2281493 N (109%) in increments of approximately 20907 N (1%). These three levels of thrust are called respectively rated power level, minimum power level, and full power level. Throttling is obtained by varying the output of the pre-burners, thus varying the speed of the high-pressure turbo-pumps, and therefore the mass flow rates of the propellants [ 50]."
What type of injector allows for variable throttling by adjusting a central component to change the opening area?," Throttling can also by obtained by using a variable-area injector. In particular, a pintle injector has a single central pintle, which can be moved to vary the area of the ori fices of the injector, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 49]. 2.6 Injectors 161 The maximum thrust of the engine is obtained by fully opening the ori fices."
How does reducing the orifice area affect pressure in the combustion chamber and engine thrust?," When the area of the ori fices is reduced with respect to its maximum value, the pressure in the combustion chamber and the thrust of the engine are also reduced. A pintle injector has been used in the Apollo Lunar Module Descent Engine [ 76], a scheme of which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 77]."
What type of propellants does the Merlin rocket engine use in its gas-generator power cycle?," 162 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Ap i n t l ei n j e c t o rh a sa l s ob e e nu s e di nt h eM e r l i nr o c k e te n g i n e ,w h i c hb u r n s liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine has been developed by Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) for its Falcon rocket family [ 78]."
"What formula is used to determine the injection velocity in an injector design based on mass flow rate, cross-sectional area, and density?"," In order to design an injector, it is necessary to take account of some factors. One of them is the injection velocity v(m/s), which is the velocity at which the oxidiser, or the fuel, is injected into the combustion chamber. The injection velocity can be determined as follows v= . m A rho where . m(kg/s)is the mass flow rate of the propellant, A(m2)i st h ea r e ao ft h eo r i fi c e s of the injector, and rho (kg/m3)i st h ed e n s i t yo ft h ep r o p e l l a n t ."
How is the drop of injection pressure calculated using the coefficient of discharge and fluid density?," Another factor is the drop of injection pressure ∆pi(N/m2), which can be calculated as follows ∆pi=1 2 rho ( v Cd ) 2 =1 2 rho ( . m ACd ) 2 where Cdis a dimensionless coef ficient of discharge, whose value (usually in the range 0.5 ≤Cd≤0.92) is determined experimentally by means of water flow tests."
What effect does the value of Cd have on the injection pressure for a constant injection velocity?," An ori fice having a well-round entrance and a smooth bore has also a high value of Cd,a n dg i v e sr i s et oal o wv a l u eo fd r o po fi n j e c t i o np r e s s u r e ,f o rt h es a m ev a l u eo f injection velocity v. 2.6 Injectors 163 Another factor is the resultant angle βof two impinging streams of propellant."
What are the symbols representing the mass flow rates of the two streams in the given scenario?," With reference to the following figure, let . m1and . m2(kg/s)be the mass flow rates of two impinging streams. Let α1andα2be the angles which these streams form with the axis of symmetry of the thrust chamber. Let v1andv2(m/s) be the injection velocities of the two streams, determined as has been shown above."
How is the resultant angle defined in relation to the direction of the resulting stream after impact?," The resultant angle βof these impinging streams is de fined by Huzel and Huang [5]b ym e a n so ft h ef o l l o w i n ge q u a t i o n β=arctan ( . m1v1sinα1 - . m2v2sinα2 . m1v1cosα1+ . m2v2cosα2 ) The resultant angle βis de fined in such a way as to be positive when the resulting stream after the impact is directed toward the chamber wall, and negative when the stream is directed toward the axis of symmetry of the thrust chamber."
What is the advantageous range of the β angle for mixing hypergolic propellants in a combustion chamber?," In case of an engine burning a combination of hypergolic propellants, a small posi- tive value (ranging from 0.03491 rad to 0.08727 rad) of the βangle is advantageous for the purpose of mixing the liquid propellants along the wall of the combustion chamber. In case of an engine burning a combination of cryogenic propellants, their mixing occurs principally in the gaseous state."
What type of β angle should be selected to prevent the formation of hot streaks in the combustion chamber?," In these conditions, a positive value of the β angle can generate hot streaks on the wall of the combustion chamber. A negative value of the βangle should be chosen to avoid this undesirable effect. Another factor is the injection momentum ratio, which is de fined as follows Rm= . movo . mfvf where ."
What is the injection momentum ratio for the design of oxygen-hydrogen injectors according to Huzel and Huang?," mo(kg/s)and . mf(kg/s)are the mass flow rates of respectively the oxidiser and the fuel, and vo(m/s) and vf(m/s) are their respective injection velocities. The injection momentum ratio is an index of performance. For the design of oxygen- hydrogen injectors, Huzel and Huang [ 5]i n d i c a t et h ef o l l o w i n gv a l u e so fi n j e c t i o n 164 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly momentum ratio: 1."
What is the range of Rm values when gaseous hydrogen is utilized as the propellant?,"5 ≤Rm≤3.5 when liquid hydrogen is injected, and 0.5 ≤Rm≤ 0.9 when gaseous hydrogen id injected. Still another factor is the structural load, which is due to the pressures (measured in N/m2)e x e r t e db yt h ep r o p e l l a n t sb e h i n dt h ef a c eo ft h ei n j e c t o r( pf)a n di nt h e injector manifolds ( pm)."
What is the relationship between the pressure behind the injector face and the drop of injection pressure in steady state?," In the steady state, the pressure pfbehind the face of the injector is equal to the drop of injection pressure ∆pi,d e fi n e da b o v e ,a sf o l l o w s pf=∆pi The pressure pmin the injector manifolds results from summing the pressure ( pc)i of the combustion chamber at the injector end to the drop ∆piof injection pressure, as follows pm=(pc)i+∆pi At the start of the engine, the pressure behind the face of the injector may be much greater than the corresponding pressure in the steady state."
What empirical formula relates the pressure load of propellants to their pressure at the moment of valve opening?," When the valves of the propellants are opened rapidly, the pressure of the propellant can cause a hydraulic ram. Let pp(N/m2)b et h ep r e s s u r eo ft h ep r o p e l l a n ta tt h em o m e n to fo p e n i n gt h e valves. Huzel and Huang [ 5]i n d i c a t et h ef o l l o w i n ge m p i r i c a lf o r m u l at oe s t i m a t e the pressure load: pf=pm=4pp As an example of application, it is required to determine the size of the ori fices of the injector for the two propellants, the injection velocity, and the injection momentum ratio for a rocket engine of given properties."
What is the mass flow rate of the oxidiser in the thrust chamber?," Let us consider again the rocket engine described in Sects. 2.3,2.4,a n d 2.5.T h i s engine burns a combination of liquid oxygen (oxidiser) with RP-1 (fuel). The density of the oxidiser is rho o=1141 kg/m3and its mass flow rate in the thrust chamber is . mo=880.4k g/s. The density of the fuel is rho f=808."
What is the effect of the discharge coefficient on the total area of the orifices in the injector given the injection pressure drop?,1 kg/m3and its mass flow rate in the thrust chamber is . mf=375.1k g/s. The drop of injection pressure is ∆pi= 1.379 ×106N/m2for both of the propellants. A coef ficient of discharge Cd=0.75 is taken for both of them. The total area Aoof the ori fices for the oxidiser in the injector results from the following equation ∆pi=1 2 rho o ( .

What is the calculated diameter of each orifice for the oxidiser if 700 doublets are used?," In case of using 700 doublets for the oxidiser and 700 doublets for the fuel, the area of each ori fice for the oxidiser is ao=Ao 2×700=0.02093 1400=0.1495 ×10 - 4m2=0.1495 cm2 Hence, the diameter of each ori fice for the oxidiser is do= ( 4ao π ) 1 2 = ( 4×0.1495 ×10 - 4 3.1416 ) 1 2 =0.004362 m =4."
What is the diameter of each fuel orifice calculated in millimeters?,"362 mm Likewise, the area of each ori fice for the fuel is af=Af 2×700=0.01059 1400=7.564×10 - 6m2 Hence, the diameter of each ori fice for the fuel is df= ( 4af π ) 1 2 = ( 4×7.564×10 - 6 3.1416 ) 1 2 =0.003103 m =3.103 mm The mean velocities of injection for respectively the oxidiser ( vo)a n dt h ef u e l( vf) result from the following equation v= ."
Calculate the injection momentum ratio using the values for oxidiser and fuel provided.

What is the purpose of a turbo-pump in rocket propulsion systems?," A turbo-pump is a rotating machine which takes one of the liquid propellants at low pressure from a tank and supplies it to the combustion chamber at the required mass flow rate and injection pressure. The energy absorbed by the turbine is provided by the expansion of compressed gases, which are usually mixtures of the propellants burned in the engine [ 79]."
What are the various configurations of components used in propulsion systems called?," There are several ways to use the propellants for this purpose. Therefore, there are several arrangements of components, which are called rocket engine cycles. Some of these cycles are brie fly described below. The gas-generator cycle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 80]."
What components are included in a gas generator for the bi-propellant gas-generator cycle?," In the bi-propellant gas-generator cycle (left), the working fluid for the turbine (T) is derived by combustion of the oxidiser (O) with the fuel (F) in the gas generator (GG) at a temperature below the turbine temperature limits. A gas generator consists of a propellant valve, an injector, and a combustion chamber."
What is the operating temperature limit of the current turbine materials used in the gas generator?," The propellants for the gas generator are tapped from the turbo-pump discharge lines, injected into the combustor through the gas-generator injector, burned, and converted to gas. This gas is expanded through the turbine which drives the pumps. Since the operating temperature limit of 2.7 Gas-generator and Other Engine Cycles 167 the current turbine materials is about 1090 K, the gas generator is operated with excess fuel, in order for the temperature to remain within this limit."
What percentage of propellants in the J-2X engine is utilized for sustaining engine operation?," A small amount (about 3% in the J-2X engine) of the propellants is used to keep the engine running, whereas the remaining part of the propellants is used to generate thrust. A gas generator (GG) is a separate, small combustion chamber which produces gases. These gases are used to drive the turbines connected to the pumps."
"What type of cycle does the J-2X engine operate on, and what are its primary propellants?"," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 81], shows a scheme of the J-2X engine, which is based on the gas-generator cycle. This engine uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as, respectively, fuel and oxidiser (OXID). These propellants go immediately from their tanks into their turbo-pumps, which are the fuel turbo-pump (FTP) and the oxidiser turbo-pump (OTP)."
What type of combustion products does the gas generator produce in the described system?," There, the mechanical energy of the rotating pumps is used to put the liquid propellants under pressure. At the exit from the pumps, a small amount of each propellant is tapped off to supply the gas generator (GG), which is substantially a small engine included into the principal engine. This small engine generates hot combustion products (which are, in the present case, steam and gaseous hydrogen) at high pressure."
What is the purpose of the heat exchanger in relation to the gases and the oxygen tank?," These gases are used to drive first the turbine connected to the fuel pump and then the turbine connected to the oxidiser pump. After driving the two turbines, the hot gases are used to warm the helium flowing through the heat exchanger (HEX), which is used to pressurise the oxygen tank of the stage, and are then dumped along the walls of the nozzle extension, to keep them cool."
What is the purpose of the hydrogen from the fuel pump in relation to the nozzle and combustion chamber?," The remaining liquid oxygen, which does not go to the gas generator, is directed to the main injector. The hydrogen coming from the fuel pump is used to regeneratively cool the walls of the nozzle and the walls of the main combustion chamber (MCC), and is then directed to the injector of the main combustion chamber."
What process involves routing a small quantity of warm gaseous hydrogen back to the tank for pressurization?," A very small amount of the warm gaseous hydrogen is tapped off before entering the main injector, and is routed back to pressurise the hydrogen tank, as is the case with the helium flowing through the heat exchanger 168 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly on the oxygen side. The exhaust gases coming from the turbines are dumped along the nozzle extension."
What is the main reason for reduced efficiency in gases that generate thrust in a simple engine cycle?," These gases generate some thrust, but not as ef ficiently as the gases which are accelerated by flowing through the throat and the nozzle. The loss of effectiveness is the price paid for this simple engine cycle. On the other hand, the turbines of an engine using a gas-generator cycle are not subject to counter-pressures which would arise if the exhaust gases where injected into the combustion chamber."
What components are used to manage engine control during startup and shutdown phases?," This fact makes it easy to design the turbines and the pipes. The other items shown in the preceding scheme are the main fuel valve (MFV), the main oxidiser valve (MOV), the gas-generator fuel valve (GGFV), and the gas-generator oxidiser valve (GGOV). These and other minor valves are used to control the engine during the start and shutdown transients [ 81]."
"What type of cycle uses the Vulcain, HM7B, and Merlin engines?"," The gas-generator cycle is used in the Vulcain, HM7B, Merlin, RS-68, RS-27A, J-2X, J-2, F-1, RD-107, and CE-20 engines. The thrust chamber tap-off cycle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 80]. In the tap-off cycle, the working fluid for the turbine is tapped off near the face of the injector at a location in which a suf ficiently cool gas is available [ 82]."
"Which engines utilize the expander cycle, also known as the hot-fuel tap-off cycle?"," The thrust chamber tap-off cycle is used in the J-2S engine. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 80], shows the expander cycle, which is used in the RL10, Vinci, RD-0146, YF-75D, LE-5A/5B (expander bleed cycle), LE-9, and MB-60 engines. 2.7 Gas-generator and Other Engine Cycles 169 In the expander cycle, also called hot-fuel tap-off cycle, hydrogen (F) is evaporated and heated in the jacket of the thrust chamber, and is then used to drive the turbines."
What is primarily burned in the pre-burner during the staged-combustion cycle?," The exhaust gas coming from the turbines is fed to the combustion chamber [ 82]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 80], shows the staged- combustion cycle. In the staged-combustion cycle, most of the fuel (F), except a small quantity used as coolant, and a small amount of the oxidiser (O) are pre-burned in a pre-burner (P) at an extremely fuel-rich mixture."
What components are combined in the main combustion chamber before combustion in the staged-combustion cycle?," The resulting fuel-rich hot gas is used to drive the turbo-pump turbine, and is then injected into the main combustion chamber together with the remaining oxidiser and the coolant fuel, where all of them are finally burned. The following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 50], shows the staged-combustion cycle, used in the RS-25 engine (which is the main engine of the Space Shuttle) and in the RS-170/180 engine."
What type of propellant gas generators are mentioned for use in turbine spinners during engine start?," 170 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Liquid-propellant rocket engines may also use solid-propellant gas generators for turbine spinners at the engine start or for other applications of brief duration. This is because the temperature of the gases generated by solid-propellant gas generators is usually above 1366 K, which fact makes them un fit for non-cooled components over long times."
What is the primary function of the gas generators mentioned in the text?," These gas generators are only used to start, but the pressure and the gas flow should continue after the burnout of the solid propellant and the takeover of the liquid propellants. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5]s h o w so n eo fs u c hd e v i c e s , which is a disposable solid-propellant gas generator used to drive the turbines at the engine start."
What is the purpose of the cartridge described in the gas generator?," This device is a cartridge bolted to a flange at a liquid-propellant gas generator, as will be shown below. This particular cartridge can be used only once. 2.7 Gas-generator and Other Engine Cycles 171 Ar o c k e te n g i n em a ya l s ob es t a r t e db yu s i n gas t a r tt a n kc o n t a i n i n gag a s( f o r example, hydrogen or helium) stored under high pressure."
What is another name for the device that allows gas to flow and activate the turbines in the J-2 engine?," This device, also known as start bottle, is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 17], where the J-2 engine is illustrated. The J-2 engine was used for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles for the NASA Apollo programme. When the engine is started, the gas is allowed to leave the start tank and impinge on the blades of the turbines which drive the pumps."
What factors influence the uniform combustion rate of solid propellants?," Solid propellants are mixtures of fuels with oxidisers. Their exposed surfaces burn uniformly at rates depending on the temperature and on the pressure of the combusted gases. According to Huzel and Huang [ 5], the combustion rate R(m/s) of a given solid propellant can be expressed as follows R=k1 ( pc 6."
What is the pressure in the combustion chamber expressed in N/m²?,"895×106 ) n where k1(m/s) is a constant quantity, which expresses the constant burning rate of a given propellant, at a given initial temperature, and at a pressure of 6.895 ×106N/m2 in the combustion chamber, pc(N/m2)i st h ep r e s s u r ei nt h ec o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e r , andnis a constant quantity, whose value depends on the sensitivity of the burning rate of the propellant to changes of pressure, at a given temperature."
What components are needed to calculate the mass flow rate through a solid-propellant gas generator?," The mass flow rate . mg(kg/s)through a solid-propellant gas generator can be calculated by means of the following equation of [ 5]: . mg=AbR rho p 172 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly where Ab(m2)i st h eb u r n i n ga r e ao ft h ep r o p e l l a n t , R(m/s) is the combustion rate, and rho p(kg/m3)i st h ed e n s i t yo ft h ep r o p e l l a n t ."
What must remain unchanged to ensure a consistent mass flow rate in a solid-propellant gas generator?," In order for the mass flow rate of a solid-propellant gas generator to be constant, the burning area of the propellant must also be constant. The total area Ao(m2)o ft h eo r i fi c e so fas o l i d - p r o p e l l a n tg a sg e n e r a t o rm u s tb e such as to satisfy the following equation of [ 5]: pc=k2 ( Ab Ao ) 1 1 - n where pc(N/m2)i st h ep r e s s u r ei nt h ec o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e r , k2(N/m2)i sac o n s t a n t quantity for a given propellant at a given temperature, Ab(m2)i st h eb u r n i n ga r e ao f the propellant, and nis the constant quantity mentioned above."
What are the two types of liquid mono-propellants mentioned for generating gases?," Liquid mono-propellants may also be used to generate gases. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 83], shows two of these gas generators using (left) hydrazine and (right) hydrogen peroxide. Gas generators using mono-propellants are simple and easy to control. They require a separate tank, unless the gas-generating mono-propellant is also used to feed the main engine."
What specific advantage do liquid-propellant gas generators provide when integrated with liquid-propellant rocket engines?," Liquid-propellant gas generators are frequently chosen for liquid-propellant rocket engines, because the same propellants are used in the gas generators and in such engines. The liquid-propellant gas generator used in the H-1 rocket engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5]."
What type of fuel and oxidizer are utilized in the H-1 engine developed for the Saturn Ia and Saturn I-B rockets?," The H-1 engine was devel- oped by Rocketdyne for use in the S-I and S-IB first stages of respectively the Saturn Ia n dt h eS a t u r nI - Br o c k e t s ,w h i c hw e r eu s e df o rt h eN A S AA p o l l op r o g r a m m e . The propellants used in this engine are liquid oxygen and RP-1 (kerosene)."
What components make up the liquid-propellant gas generator in the H-1 engine?," The liquid-propellant gas generator of the H-1 engine produces combusted gases during steady-state operation to drive the two-stage turbine. 2.7 Gas-generator and Other Engine Cycles 173 The turbine supplies power through a gear reduction train to drive the propellant pumps. The liquid-propellant gas generator of the H-1 engine consists of a gas gener- ator control valve, an injector assembly, a combustor, and two squib-less igniters."
What initiates the ignition of the squib-less igniters before liquid propellants enter the gas generator?, These components are brie fly described below. The propellants entering the liquid- propellant gas generator are ignited by a solid-propellant gas generator (SPGG in the following figure) and by the two squib-less igniters during engine start. The hot gases from the solid-propellant gas generator ignite the squib-less igniters before the liquid propellants enter the liquid-propellant gas generator.
What component of the thrust chamber assembly is responsible for actuating the control valve?," The igniters burn for 2.5–3 s to ensure the ignition of the liquid propellants. The control valve of the liquid-propellant gas generator is a normally closed valve containing two poppets, which admit the bootstrap propellants into the combustor of the gas generator during engine operation. 174 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly The combustion pressure in the thrust chamber actuates the control valve by means of a piston, which opens the fuel poppet first."
What are the cracking pressures for the fuel and oxidiser poppets in N/m2?, A yoke integral with the piston opens the oxidiser poppet. The cracking pressures relative to the atmosphere are (7.239 ±1.379) ×105N/m2for the fuel poppet and (13.79 ±1.379) ×105N/m2for the oxidiser poppet. The fully-open operating pressure relative to the atmosphere is (18.96 ±1.724) ×105N/m2for the control valve.
What is the mass flow rate of the fuel used in the bootstrap propellant system?," The bootstrap propellant mass flow rates are 6.133 kg/s for the fuel and 2.091 kg/s for the oxidiser. A bellows assembly enclosing the liquid oxygen poppet stem and the closure spring, and the seals on the actuator piston prevent leakage of fuel and oxidiser into the control valve actuator. A drain line directs any fuel leakage into the valve actuator to the fuel drain manifold, where it is dumped overboard into the engine exhaust stream."
What facilitates the closure of the control valve during engine cut-off?," The control valve is designed to ensure a fuel-rich cut-off to prevent an excessive increase in temperature in the combustor with consequent turbine burning. The spring pressure closes the control valve at engine cut-off, when the pressure in the thrust chamber decreases. The fuel and the oxidiser from the gas generator control valve enter the injector and flow through passages which provide a uniform mixture ratio o/f=0."
What is the function of the oxidiser lead during the start phase of the injector cavity?,"3409. The injector cavity is designed to permit an oxidiser lead into the combustor during start to prevent detonation. From the injector, two fuel streams impinge on a single oxidiser stream. The injector has 44 impingement points. The fuel which enters the combustor through 36 holes around the periphery of the impingements provides film coolant for the injector."
What type of gas is used to purge the oxidiser injector during the countdown process?," During countdown, the oxidiser injector of the gas generator receives a purge with ambient gaseous nitrogen to prevent entrance of contaminants from the solid-propellant gas generator into the injector. The bootstrap propellants burn in the combustor and exit to the gas turbine. Two squib-less igniters installed in the combustor just below the injector of the gas gener- ator assure propellant ignition during start."
What is the operating temperature range in Kelvin for the combustor?," The combustor is a welded assembly with flanges for installation of the solid-propellant gas generator and for attachment to the gas turbine. The operating temperature is 920.9 ±264.3 K, and the operating absolute pressure is (4.456 ±0.03378) ×106N/m2. Two squib-less igniters installed in the injector mounting flange on the combustor burn for 2."
What role do igniters play if the solid-propellant gas generator fails before the bootstrap propellant enters the combustor?,"5–3 s after their ignition by the solid-propellant gas generator. They ensure ignition of fuel and oxidiser if the solid-propellant gas generator should have expired before bootstrap propellant entry into the combustor. Ag a sg e n e r a t o rb u r n st h ep r o p e l l a n t sj u s ta st h em a i ne n g i n ed o e s ,t h eo n l y difference being the capability possessed by the former of varying the mixture ratio o/f,w h o s ev a l u ei sa d j u s t e di no r d e rf o rt h ec o m b u s t e dg a st oh a v et h ed e s i r e d temperature and chemical properties."
What should be considered when determining the volume taken from the injector to the nozzle throat in a gas generator design?," The guidelines for designing a gas generator for a liquid bi-propellant rocket engine are the same as those relating to the thrust chamber of the main engine. When the characteristic length L*i sc a l c u l a t e d ,t h ev o l u m et ob et a k e ni n t oa c c o u n tg o e s from the injector to the throat of the nozzle of the turbine."
What is the typical maximum design temperature that turbine materials can endure?," Account is also taken of the maximum temperature which the materials of which the turbine is made can withstand. Consequently, the design temperature of the turbine is usually kept under 1255 K [ 5]. 2.8 Igniters 175 2.8 Igniters An igniter is a device which releases energy (usually in form of heat) in a rocket engine, for the purpose of initiating the combustion of the main propellants."
What type of energy source is responsible for initiating heat release in different igniter arrangements?," This combustion, after initiation, is capable of sustaining itself without the necessity of receiving heat. The source of energy which stimulates an igniter to release heat is either inside (as is the case with a solid propellant) or outside (as is the case with a spark arrangement) the igniter itself."
What is the primary role of pyrotechnic igniters in rocket engines?," The principal types of igniters used in rocket engines are described below. Pyrotechnic igniters are devices containing mixtures of fuels, oxidants, and often other materials. These devices are used in rocket engines (thrust chambers and gas generators) to release energy in form of heat. Pyrotechnic mixtures are in a state of meta-stability, meaning by this term, stability and non-reactivity under some condi- tions, and release of thermal energy originally stored in chemical form after receiving an external stimulus, which is usually given to such mixtures by addition of heat."
What is the term for the energy necessary to initiate the release of heat in a reaction?," The amount of energy required to stimulate this release of heat is called activation energy. The net amount of thermal energy released in a pyrotechnic reaction is called heat of reaction. The heats of reaction for some binary pyrotechnic compositions are given in [ 84]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 85], shows an electrically-triggered initiator, or squib, used to ignite a rocket engine."
"What diameter range, in millimeters, does the bridge wire of the initiator have?"," The initiator shown in the preceding figure is a body of metal containing a prime charge, an output charge, and two contact pins used as electrodes. The prime charge is the head of an electric match, which contains a short wire (a bridge wire), 0.0127– 0.127 mm in diameter, made of a material (usually nichrome, which is an alloy 80% nickel and 20% chromium, by mass)."
What materials are mentioned as part of the pyrotechnic composition surrounding the wire?," This wire glows red-hot when a voltage is applied to its ends. The bridge wire is placed between the two electrodes, and is surrounded by a pyrotechnic composition (materials used for this purpose include 176 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly lead styphnate, lead azide, diazodinitrophenol, and zirconium-ammonium perchlo- rate) which is sensitive to heat."
What material covers the less sensitive composition in the electric match scheme?," A scheme of an electric match is shown in the following figure (re-drawn from [ 86]. The pyrotechnic composition speci fied above may be surrounded by a second, less sensitive composition, which protects the first. The second composition, in turn, is covered by a nitrocellulose lacquer. A scheme of a squib, including an electric match, is shown in the following figure (re-drawn from [ 86]."
What effect does combining the output charge with the prime charge have on ignition?," When a small voltage (28 V or less) is applied to the electrodes, the heating of the bridge wire causes the de flagration of the pyrotechnic material in contact with it. The output charge is also made of pyrotechnic material, as will be shown below. The addition of the output charge to the prime charge greatly magni fies the ignition effect."
What is the primary function of the initiator in a solid-propellant system?," 2.8 Igniters 177 The initiator supplies the energy, in form of heat, which is necessary to ignite the propellants. The solid-propellant charge burns with a hot flame within the combustion chamber. The igniter can be designed to fit directly onto the injector. This method of ignition can only be used once."
What type of igniter prevents the restart of a rocket engine?," Therefore, a rocket engine having a pyrotechnic igniter cannot be restarted, as has been shown in Sect. 2.1. The most effective materials used for output charges in initiators are metal-oxidant pyrotechnic formulations. Some examples of these formulations are shown in the following table, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 85]."
What are the two primary materials used in NOTS Model 39 pyrotechnic igniters?," Application /DesignationFuel Oxidants Binders Mk 247, Mk 265 (igniters)Boron, 23.7% KNO 3,7 0 , 7 % Laminac, 5,6% XM-6 & XM-8 (EBW) MB-1 (500-V initiator)Zirconium, 66.3% NH4ClO 4,3 2 . 7 % Nitrocellulose, 1.0% FA-878 Zirconium, 40% BaNO 3,2 0 % (ign. elements Mk 10,PbO 2,2 0 % Mk 11, Mk 13, Mk 17)PETN, 20% M2 squib Pb(SCN) 2,3 2 % Charcoal, 18%KClO 3,4 0 % Egyptian lacquer, 10% NOTS Model 39 Magnesium, 60% Polytetra fluoro-ethylene, 40% Pyrotechnic igniters can be mounted in recesses as plugs of the screw-in type, in case of gas generators and small thrust chambers."
What characteristic do hypergolic igniters possess that allows them to ignite spontaneously without an external ignition source?," Hypergolic igniters are based on the property of some bi-propellant combinations which ignite spontaneously at room temperature when the two components (the fuel and the oxidiser) of a combination get in touch one with the other. Therefore, hypergolic combinations do not require an external source of ignition."
What is the advantage of using a valve for fluid mixing in ignition systems?," They need only a valve to mix the fluids for the purpose of initiating the combustion. This method of ignition reduces the components of an ignition system, and therefore its chances of failure. As has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.2,t h em o s tc o m m o nf u e l su s e di nac o m b i - nation of hypergolic propellants are hydrazine (H 2NNH 2), monomethyl hydrazine (CH 3(NH)NH 2), unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H 2NN(CH 3)2), and Aerozine 50, the last being an equal mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine."
What is a hypergolic igniter commonly used for in bi-propellant engines?," The oxidisers used in combination with these fuels are usually nitrogen tetroxide (N 2O4)a n dv a r i o u sb l e n d so fn i t r o g e nt e t r o x i d ew i t hn i t r i co x i d e( N O ) . Hypergolic igniters have been used in liquid bi-propellant engines. An example has been cited in Sect. 2.1,w h i c hd e s c r i b e sam i x t u r eo fg a s e o u s fl u o r i n ew i t hl i q u i d oxygen used to start an engine which burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen."
What two substances are combined in the RD-180 engine's hypergolic ignition device?," Two 178 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly further examples are cited below. The RD-180 engine of the Atlas V rocket burns a mixture of kerosene with liquid oxygen. This engine has a device, placed in the fuel line, for hypergolic ignition. This device consists of two cartridges which contain am i x t u r eo f1 5 %t r i e t h y l a l u m i n i u m( A l 2(C2H5)6,a l s ok n o w na sT E A ,w h i c hi sa pyrophoric substance) with 85% triethylborane ((C 2H5)3B, also known as TEB)."
Where is one cartridge of the TEA-TEB mixture located in relation to the pre-burner in the RD-180 engine?," A scheme of the RD-180 engine is shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of the United Launch Alliance [ 87]. As shown in the preceding figure, the TEA-TEB mixture is stored in two closed cylindrical cartridges, one of which is in the fuel line directly ahead of the pre-burner, and the other is in either of the main fuel inlet to the two main combustion chambers."
What component connects the start tank to the fuel lines for engine ignition?," The cartridges have burst diaphragms to prevent this mixture from coming in contact with atmospheric oxygen. The pre-burner illustrated above is the gas generator which drives the main turbine. In order to start the engine, a start tank of spherical shape, shown in the lower part of the preceding figure, is connected to both of the fuel lines by means of tubes and associated valves."
What initiates the release of the TEA-TEB mixture into the gas generator?," The start tank is filled with fuel and put under pressure by using gas. When the valves to the fuel lines and the cartridges are opened, the high pressure of the fuel drives pistons which are in the cartridges. This causes the TEA-TEB mixture to be released into the gas generator and into the main combustion chambers, which in turn have been filled with oxygen after the liquid oxygen valves are opened, and the tank pressure causes oxygen to enter the engine."
What initiates the combustion process inside the gas generator and main combustion chambers?," The TEA-TEB mixture comes in touch with oxygen, and therefore self-ignites and starts the combustion inside the gas generator and the main combustion chambers. The combustion is sustained by the fuel entering the gas generator and the main combustion chambers just after the TEA-TEB mixture. Now, the gas generator is running, and therefore the main turbine drives the boost pumps (shown on the two sides of the preceding figure), which in 2."
"What propellants does the F-1 engine burn, and what are their specific components?","8 Igniters 179 turn discharge the propellants under pressure to the gas generator and to the main combustion chambers. The F-1 engine of the Saturn V rocket burns a mixture of RP-1 (kerosene) with liquid oxygen. This engine also has an igniter containing a cartridge of hypergolic fluid (which is, again, a mixture of 85% triethylborane with 15% triethylaluminium) with burst diaphragms at either end."
What type of fluid ignites spontaneously upon contact with liquid oxygen in the combustion chamber?," This igniter is in the fuel line, and the hypergolic fluid has its own ori fices in the injector of the main combustion chamber. The hyper- golic fluid, followed by the fuel, enters the main combustion chamber. There, this fluid ignites spontaneously in contact with the liquid oxygen already injected into the main combustion chamber."
What is the primary limitation of hypergolic igniters in rocket engines?," This method of ignition is also known as hypergolic starting slug [ 88]. The hypergolic igniters described in the examples cited above can only be used once, and therefore the rocket engines using them cannot be restarted. However, Hulka et al [ 89]h a v ed e s c r i b e dam o d i fi e dv e r s i o no ft h eR u s s i a nN K - 3 3r o c k e t engine, called AJ26-59, which has the capability of being restarted."
What type of propellants does the engine utilize for combustion besides the hypergolic ignition?," This engine burns liquid oxygen and kerosene, which of course are not hypergolic propellants, and also uses the TEA-TEB mixture for hypergolic ignition. Its capability of being restarted is obtained by carrying on board further cartridges of the TEA-TEB mixture than those necessary to the first start."
What type of propellant is utilized in the AJ10-190 engine for the Space Shuttle's orbital manoeuvring system?," Ar o c k e te n g i n ed e s i g n e dt ob u r ne x c l u s i v e l yh y p e r g o l i cp r o p e l l a n t sd o e sn o t require any special apparatus to be restarted as many times as necessary, because its propellants ignite spontaneously when coming in mutual contact. Such is the case, for example, with the AJ10-190 engine (whose fuel and oxidiser are respec- tively monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) used in the orbital manoeuvring system of the Space Shuttle."
What is required for starting and stopping engines using propellants other than hypergolic types?," An engine using other propellants than those of hyper- golic type requires a re-usable igniter (a spark plug, for example) and a system of valves in order to be started and stopped when necessary. Electric spark igniters based on spark plugs are often used in liquid-propellant rockets when multiple starts are necessary."
What type of igniter employs a high-voltage electric circuit for generating sparks in the combustion chamber?," They are ef ficient and reliable, and can be used in either direct spark igniters or augmented spark igniters. In case of a direct spark igniter, a high-voltage electric circuit is used to generate as p a r ka c r o s sag a p ,i no r d e rt oe x p o s et h ev a p o r i s e dp r o p e l l a n t si nt h ec o m b u s t i o n chamber to a ionising electric discharge, as shown in the following scheme, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 90]."
What is the purpose of direct spark igniters in small combustion chambers?," 180 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly Direct spark igniters are used is small combustion chambers, because the electric discharge is con fined to a very small zone. One of the six spark plugs used in the main engine of the Space Shuttle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 50]."
What type of igniter is employed in the main engine of the Space Shuttle to initiate combustion?," In the main engine of the Space Shuttle, an augmented spark igniter (also known as torch igniter), is used. In this type of igniter, a small quantity of propellants (in the present case, hydrogen and oxygen) is swirled into a very small zone, where a spark plug generates an electric discharge. This causes the ionisation of the gasi fied propellants, which become very hot and generate a flame front which propagates toward the combustion zone, just when the rest of the propellants reaches the injector."
What type of igniter was utilized in the main engine of the Space Shuttle?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 50], illustrates an augmented spark igniter used in the main engine of the Space Shuttle. 2.8 Igniters 181 The J-2 rocket engine, which was used for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles for the NASA Apollo programme, had an augmented spark igniter."
How many augmented spark igniters are present in each main engine of the Space Shuttle?," Each of the main engines of the Space Shuttle had three augmented spark igniters, one for the main combustion chamber and two for the pre-burners. The chamber of each augmented spark igniter was located in the centre of the injector, as shown in the preceding figure. Two spark plugs were used, for redundancy, in each augmented spark igniter."
What type of fuel mixture is used in the augmented spark igniter shown in the figure?," Af u r t h e rs c h e m eo ft h i st y p eo fi g n i t e ri ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et o the courtesy of NASA [ 91], which illustrates an augmented spark igniter used in a 445 N reaction control engine burning a mixture of liquid oxygen (LO 2)w i t hl i q u i d methane (LCH 4)."
What is necessary for liquid mono-propellants to initiate and sustain decomposition reactions in rocket engines?," 182 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly In case of rocket engines using liquid mono-propellants (for example, hydrogen peroxide), catalysts are used to initiate and sustain the reaction of decomposition of the mono-propellant. Liquid catalysts, if used for this purpose, require complex systems of valves and interlocking devices."
What type of rocket engine is the AR2-3 and who developed it?," This can be avoided by using solid catalysts. These catalysts have also been used in liquid bi-propellant rocket engines. One of such engines is the AR2-3, which was developed by Rocketdyne in the 1950s, and is brie fly described below. The AR2-3 is one of the family of AR engines, where AR stands for aircraft rocket."
What is the fixed thrust of the first engine in this family?," The first engine of this family was the AR-1, which operated at a fixed thrust of 25577 N. It was proven in flight on the FJ-4 aircraft. The AR2 series of engines includes the AR-2, the AR2-1, the AR2-2, and the AR2- 3. All the engines of the AR2 series have a main-stage thrust of 29358 N and are variable down to 14679 N of thrust."
What type of engines utilize two centrifugal pumps to supply hydrogen peroxide and kerosene for thrust augmentation in specific aircraft?," These engines use 90% hydrogen peroxide and kerosene. They have been used oh the FJ-4, F-86, and NF104A aircraft. They are liquid-propellant pump-fed engines designed to provide aircraft thrust augmentation. The AR2-3 rocket engine supplies hydrogen peroxide and kerosene propellants to the thrust chamber by means of two centrifugal pumps (one for the oxidiser and one for the fuel)."
What components receive oxidiser flow after it exits the pump outlet?," These pumps are directly driven by a single turbine. The pumps and the turbine are mounted on the same shaft. The oxidiser flows from the pump outlet through the pressure-actuated oxidiser valve, through the thrust chamber cooling jacket, and into the main thrust chamber, through the silver-plated catalytic screen pack, where it is decomposed into super-heated steam and oxygen."
What component regulates the fuel flow from the pump outlet before it reaches the fuel injector?," The fuel flows from the pump outlet through the chamber-pressure-actuated fuel valve, into the concentric annular-ring type fuel injector, and is injected into the hot, oxygen-rich gases, where it burns and is exhausted through the 12:1 area ratio nozzle. The auto- ignition of the fuel eliminates the necessity of an ignition system."
What percentage of the oxidiser flow is delivered from the oxidiser pump discharge into the thrust control valve?," A small oxidiser flow, of about 3% from the oxidiser pump discharge, is delivered and metered through the thrust control valve into a catalytic gas generator, where it is decomposed into super-heated steam and oxygen to drive the turbine. As c h e m eo ft h ee n g i n e fl o wd e s c r i b e da b o v ei ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e , due to the courtesy of NASA [ 92]."
What is the thrust produced by the engine when functioning in emergency conditions as a mono-propellant engine?," 2.8 Igniters 183 Under emergency conditions, the engine may be operated as a mono-propellant engine using the oxidiser. The engine operates at a moderate chamber pressure and provides 29358 N of thrust in vacuo and 246 s speci fic impulse. At i m e l yi g n i t i o no ft h ep r o p e l l a n t si se s s e n t i a lt ot h es a f ea c c o m p l i s h m e n to f am i s s i o n ."
What causes the buildup of fuel in the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant engine?,"T h i sh o l d si np a r t i c u l a ri nc a s eo fm a n n e dm i s s i o n s .F o rt h i sp u r p o s e , as a f e t yd e v i c ei sr e q u i r e dt oc o n t r o lt h es u p p l yo ff u e lo ro x i d i s e ro rb o t ht oa liquid-propellant engine. A delayed ignition in the combustion chamber causes an accumulation of fuel within the chamber."
What effects can result from the accumulation of materials in an engine?," This accumulation can cause an explosion and consequently the destruction of the engine or even of the whole vehicle on which the engine is mounted. These destructive effects can be avoided by interrupting or reducing the flow of either fuel, or oxidiser, or both to the combustion chamber when the combustion does not take place within a proper period of time."
What action does the control system take upon detecting a malfunction in the engine?," When a malfunction is detected, the control system switches the engine to a safe lock-up mode or shuts the engine down. In order to assure a timely and even ignition of propellants and a smooth and quick increase in their flow to the rated value, the initial values of flow and mixture ratio are different from the corresponding operational values."
What effect does a low initial flow value have on fuel accumulation in the combustion chamber?," A low initial value of flow prevents an excessive quantity of unburned fuel from accumulating in the combustion chamber. An initial value of mixture ratio close to the stoichiometric 184 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly value results in a high release of heat per unit mass of propellant. This fact, in turn, makes it possible to the hot gases in the combustion chamber to reach an equilibrium more rapidly than would be the case with other values of mixture ratio."
What is the common characteristic of the mixture ratio in operating conditions for achieving high specific impulse?," By contrast, as has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.4,t h em i x t u r er a t i oi no p e r a t i n gc o n d i t i o n si s usually fuel-rich, in order to obtain a high value of speci fic impulse. According to Sutton and Biblarz [ 2], the total time required to start a liquid- propellant rocket engine comprises ideally the following times: (1) time (from 0."
What are the sequential time intervals involved in the process of propellants entering the combustion chamber?,"002 s to more than 1 s) taken by the valves, which control the admittance of the propellants in the combustion chamber, to move from the closed position to the fully open position; (2) time taken by the propellants to go from the valves to the injector face; (3) time taken by the propellants to form and mix discrete streams of droplets into the combustion chamber; (4) time (from 0."
What is the duration for the vaporisation and ignition of propellant droplets?,02 to 0.05 s) taken by the droplets of propellant to vaporise and ignite; (5) time taken by the flame front to propagate downstream of the ignition section along the axis of the combustion chamber; and (6) time taken by the ignited propellant to raise the temperature and the pressure within the combustion chamber to values so high as to make the combustion self-sustaining.
How does the length of the intervals relate to the size of the combustion chamber?," There are overlaps in these intervals of time, because some of them may occur simultaneously. Apart from interval (4), the length of these intervals increases with the diameter of the combustion chamber. The propellant valves are designed in such a way as to operate in a desired sequence, in order to admit one of the propellant before the other in the combus- tion chamber, and to also control the flow and the mixture ratio."
What is the purpose of partially opening valves at ignition?," Such valves are often partially opened at the ignition time, for the purpose of avoiding the accumu- lation of unburned propellants in the combustion chamber. After a signal indicating as u c c e s s f u li g n i t i o nh a sb e e nr e c e i v e db yt h ec o n t r o l l e r ,t h ev a l v e sa r em o v e dt ot h e fully open position and the full flow of propellants arrives at the combustion chamber."
"What types of devices can indicate successful ignition, as mentioned in the provided information?"," The signal of successful ignition can be generated by using several devices. Some of such devices are indicated below. They are: (a) Photocells for visual detection. (b) Optical detectors, such as cells, mounted inside the combustion chamber, which are sensitive to the visible or infrared radiation which is emitted by the combusted gases."
What device measures gas temperature by analyzing emitted radiation wavelengths?," (c) Pyrometers, which determine the temperature of the combusted gases by measuring the wavelength of the emitted radiation. (d) Fusible wire links, which are based on a fusible wire strung between two parallel conductors placed near the exit section of the thrust chamber, downstream of the throat. This wire is also a conductor, which is fused by the ignition flame, when the combustion reaction has been initiated correctly."
What happens to the motor circuit when the wire melts from the heat created by ignition?," The control system is substantially an electric motor, which is connected to a source of electric 2.8 Igniters 185 current (for example, to an accumulator). When the wire is melted, due to the heat generated by a correct ignition, then the motor circuit is interrupted and the propellant valves reach the fully open position."
What happens to the propellant valves if the combustion reaction is not initiated correctly?," By contrast, when the wire is not melted, because the combustion reaction has not been initiated correctly, then the electric motor continues to operate, and moves the propellant valves to the closed position. Before the rocket engine is started, the propellant valves are in the closed position and the electric circuit carries no current."
What was the purpose of the closure of the switch in the electrical motor operation?," At the starting moment, the closure of a switch causes the electric motor to be fed by current, and therefore the propellant valves are moved toward the open position. A device like this was invented in 1952 by Prentiss [ 93]. (e) Pressure-sensing devices, apt to detect the pressure rise in the combustion chamber due to a correct ignition of the propellants."
What type of wires are utilized to measure varying electric resistance in relation to ignition events in combustion chambers?," Such devices, if capable of withstanding very high pressures, can also be used for multi-start engines. (f) Resistance wires, capable of measuring different values of electric resis- tance depending on whether a correct ignition has, or has not, taken place in the combustion chamber. Such devices, if capable of withstanding high temperatures without melting, can also be used for multi-start engines."
What operational aspect do electric devices in spark plugs measure near their electrodes?," (g) Electric devices used in spark plugs. Such devices detect the correct operation of spark plugs by sensing the ionisation near the electrodes. 2.9 Combustion Instability As has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.6,b yc o m b u s t i o ni n s t a b i l i t yw em e a nt h e presence of self-sustaining pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber of a rocket engine."
What happens when unsteady heat release and acoustic fluctuations are in phase in a rocket engine?," This phenomenon can appear in thermal devices when an unsteady release of heat is coupled with pressure oscillations. In a rocket engine, the heat released by the substances which react chemically is coupled with acoustic fluctu- ations. When the unsteady heat release and the acoustic fluctuations are in phase, then even a small perturbation will amplify according to the criterion enunciated by Lord Rayleigh."
What happens to vibration when heat is added during maximum rarefaction or removed during maximum condensation?," This criterion states that “If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged. On the other hand, if heat be given at the moment of greatest rarefaction, or abstracted at the moment of greatest condensation, the vibra- tion is discouraged”."
How does the timing of heat transfer relative to condensation affect the pitch of sound?," In addition, “When the transfer of heat takes place at the moment of greatest condensation or of greatest rarefaction, the pitch is not affected … the pitch is raised if heat be communicated to the air a quarter period before the phase of greatest condensation; and the pitch is lowered if heat be communicated a quarter period after the phase of greatest condensation” [ 94]."
"What phenomenon occurs when heat release and pressure variations are synchronized, leading to significant pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber?"," In other terms, the oscilla- tions in a combustor are self-sustained when the rate of heat release and the pressure fluctuations are in phase. When this happens, pressure oscillations of large ampli- tude occur in a combustion chamber at frequencies of hundreds of hertz. Acoustic waves cause unsteadiness in a combustion process."
How does an unsteady heat release impact acoustic waves in the combustion chamber according to Lord Rayleigh's criterion?," An unsteady combustion process, 186 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly in turn, generates new acoustic waves. This fact can be represented graphically by means of the following feedback scheme. An unsteady release of heat adds energy to the acoustic waves in the combustion chamber, when the unsteady heat release rate is in phase with the pressure oscillations at the location of the heat source, in accordance with the criterion of Lord Rayleigh."
What can happen to the injection system if the flame comes back to the injector face?," Consequently, the flame in the chamber may be extinguished or may come back to the injector face and burn part of the injection system. The amplitude of these oscillations can become so large as to damage the structure of the combustion chamber or destroy the engine. These pressure waves can travel at sonic velocities up and down the length of the combustion chamber, around it, across it, or radially in and out."
What engine designed for the Saturn V rocket experienced combustion instability for over seven years during its development?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 95], shows the fundamental modes of acoustic combustion instability. The F-1 engine, which was designed in the 1950s for the Saturn V rocket, was subject to combustion instability. This instability was observed for more than seven years during the development of the engine."
What effects did pressure oscillations in the F-1 engine have on the injector face during testing?," Twenty of the forty-four tests of the first F-1 engine showed pressure oscillations due to combustion instability with peak amplitudes greater than or comparable to the average pressure in the combustor. The 2.9 Combustion Instability 187 pressure oscillations caused erosion and burning of the injector face, as a result of large radial and tangential motions of the gas."
What modifications were made to the injector plate in the Project First programme to address instability issues?," In order to solve the instability problems, a programme called Project First was created to develop a stable F-1 engine. This programme lasted for four years: from 1962 to 1965. During this time, the engine was subject to more than 2000 full-scale tests [ 96]. Copper baf fles were added to the injector plate to restrain the propagation of the pressure waves."
What device in the Pratt & Whitney FT8 gas turbine acts as a vibration absorber tuned to a specific frequency?," The recovered injector plate of an F-1 engine (on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.) is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Wikipedia [ 97]. Another example of passive control is the Pratt & Whitney FT8 gas turbine, which uses 13 Helmholtz resonators. These devices act as vibration absorbers, whose shape is chosen so that the absorption is tuned to a particular frequency, as the sequel will show."
What is a proven method to reduce combustion instabilities in a symmetric combustion chamber?," As has been shown above, the symmetry of the combustion chamber lends itself to certain natural acoustic modes which are driven into resonance because of their coupling with the rate of heat release. Several methods of breaking the symmetry of the chamber have been proven effective in quenching the combustion instabilities."
What frequency range is associated with low-frequency combustion instabilities?," Combustion instabilities have been classi fied according to their respective frequency ranges, even though there are no sharp limiting lines to separate the so-called low, intermediate, and high frequency ranges. The low-frequency (also called chugging) class includes pressure waves whose frequencies are less than 180 hertz [ 5]."
What type of wave starts with a sinusoidal form and exhibits a linear increase in amplitude over time?," In other terms, the low-frequency class includes waves whose lengths are much larger than the characteristic length (de fined 188 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly in Sect. 2.4)o ft h ec o m b u s t i o nc h a m b e r .T h ei n s t a b i l i t i e sb e l o n g i n gt ot h i sc l a s sb e g i n with a sinusoidal wave, whose amplitude grows linearly with time."
What methods can be used to eliminate instabilities resulting from the coupling between combustion and the feed system?," Such instabilities result from a coupling between the combustion process and the feed system [ 47]. They are usually eliminated by increasing the pressure drop in the injector, or by increasing the length-to-diameter ratio in the injector, or by decreasing the volume of the combustion chamber [ 49]."
What frequency range defines the high-frequency class of pressure waves?," The high-frequency (also called screaming) class includes pressure waves whose frequencies are equal to or greater than 1000 hertz [ 5]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 98], shows pressure oscillation in a combustion chamber of ar o c k e te n g i n ei nt h ep r e s e n c eo fah i g h - f r e q u e n c yi n s t a b i l i t y ."
What type of combustion instability is characterized by destructive effects and requires an oscillatory energy source?," This is type of combustion instability which causes the most destructive effects. An oscillatory source of energy is required to sustain this particular instability. This energy comes from the combustion of the propellants, and is supplied according to the manner in which the combustion takes place."
What factors contribute to the energy supply for pressure waves during the combustion process?," Each pressure wave interacts with the burning gases so strongly as to receive the sustaining energy directly from them, which means within a time interval no longer than the semi-period of the wave itself. Some of the means by which the combustion process supplies energy to the pressure waves are loss of ignition, delays due to chemical preparation or other causes, detonations, anomalous behaviour of droplets heated above their critical temperature and pressure, et c."
What are the two main techniques to reduce combustion instability in high-frequency classes?," The two principal methods used to eliminate the combustion instability of the high-frequency class are the following: (1) changing the environment in which the combustion process takes place, by changing either the geometric properties of the combustion chamber or the manner (pattern of the injection holes, or size of the injector holes, or pressure drop) in which the propellants are injected into the combustion chamber; and (2) increasing the damping characteristics of the combus- tion chamber."
What are the functions of baffles in the combustion chamber?," Some means of passive control, which can be classi fied in the second of these methods, are baf fles, acoustic liners, and resonators installed in the combustion chamber. They are brie fly described below. Baf fles are mechanical devices meant to regulate or restrain the gas flow in the vicinity of the injector face, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 49]."
What type of modes do baf fles help prevent in combustion instability?," Baf fles have been used successfully to prevent transverse acoustic modes of combustion instability. The transverse (that is, tangential and radial) modes 2.9 Combustion Instability 189 are characterised by oscillatory pressure waves and gas particle motion parallel to the injector face [ 74]. Another device for passive control is an acoustic liner installed within the combus- tion chamber."
What is the mechanism through which energy is dissipated in acoustic liners?," An acoustic liner consists of a number of cavities, each of which has an a r r o wo p e n i n go rn e c k ,a ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et ot h ec o u r t e s yo f NASA [ 49]. In acoustic liners, energy is dissipated because of jet formation in the flow of gas through their ori fices."
What is the purpose of the water-cooled acoustic liner in the described engine assembly?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 49], 190 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly shows a water-cooled acoustic liner having an array of resonator cavities and used as a combustion stabiliser for a 66723 N thrust throttleable engine burning nitrogen tetroxide (oxidiser) and Aerozine 50 (fuel)."
What is the purpose of the resonator cavities in the combustion chamber?," This combustion chamber consists of a composite cylindrical brazed shell with integral coolant passages. The liner apertures are drilled in spaces between the rect- angular passages. The resonator cavities have a damping effect, because they allow a normal velocity at the wall which has a component in phase with the pressure oscil- lation."
What are the two types of acoustic resonators mentioned in the text?," This means that work is done over each cycle in moving the fluid back and forth at the boundary. This work is equal to the energy dissipated due to jet formation and friction [ 49]. Two common types of acoustic resonators are Helmholtz resonators and quarter- wavelength tubes. AH e l m h o l t zr e s o n a t o ri sar i g i d - w a l l e dc a v i t yo fv o l u m e V(m3), which is connected through a circular ori fice of diameter d(m) and length ℓ(m) to the combustion chamber, where undesirable pressure oscillations are expected to occur."
What condition relates the wavelength of pressure oscillations to the dimensions of the resonator in the described system?," AH e l m h o l t zr e s o n a t o ri ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e . 2.9 Combustion Instability 191 For the frequencies of interest, the wavelength λof the pressure oscillations is assumed to be much greater than the dimensions of the resonator, that is, λ≫ℓ λ≫d λ≫V1 3 By choosing properly the values of these dimensions, this device can be made resonant at any desired frequency."
What is the equation used to calculate the resonance frequency of a Helmholtz resonator?," The resonance frequency f0(Hz) of a Helmholtz resonator is [ 99]: f0=a 2π [ S V(ℓ+∆ℓ) ] 1 2 =a 2π [ πd2 4V(ℓ+∆ℓ) ] 1 2 where a=( gamma RT) 1/2 (m/s) is the speed of sound, S=πd2/4 (m2)i st h ea r e ao ft h e ori fice, and ∆ℓ=0.85d(m) is the length correction, which takes account of the flow effects in the vicinity of the ori fice ends."
What elements comprise the mechanical system analogous to a Helmholtz resonator as described by multiple authors?," As has been shown by several authors (see, for example, [ 100], a Helmholtz resonator is analogous to a mechanical system comprising a body of mass m,a spring of elastic constant k,a n dad a s h p o to fm e c h a n i c a lr e s i s t a n c e Rm,w h i c hi s subject to a force F(t)=Acosωt.T h i ss y s t e mi ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e , which is due to the courtesy of NASA (adapted from [ 49])."
"What does the resonance frequency f0 depend on in relation to the parameters k, m, and other constants in the system?"," 192 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly In this mechanical system, the elastic constant kof the spring corresponds to rho a2S2/V,a n dt h em a s s mof the body corresponds to rho S(ℓ+∆ℓ), where rho is the density of the unperturbed gas. The differential equation governing the motion of the body of mass min the direction xof the driving force F(t)=Acosωtis md2x dt2+Rmdx dt+kx=Acosωt As is well known, the resonance frequency of this mechanical system is f0=1 2π ( k m ) 1 2 This equation accounts for the expression f0=[a/(2π)]{S/[V(ℓ+∆ℓ)]} 1/2 written above for the resonance frequency of a Helmholtz resonator."
What is one type of acoustic resonator used to reduce pressure variations in a combustion chamber?, AH e l m h o l t zr e s o n a t o rc a nb et u n e dt oar e s o n a n tf r e q u e n c yw h i c hc o r r e s p o n d st o one of the natural frequencies of vibration of the combustion chamber. These natural frequencies can be determined as will be shown below. Another type of acoustic resonator commonly used to damp pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber is a quarter-wavelength tube.
What is the formula for the resonance frequency of a quarter-wavelength tube in terms of speed of sound and length?," It is similar to a Helmholtz resonator, but has no cavity, as shown in the following figure. 2.9 Combustion Instability 193 The resonance frequency f0(Hz) of a quarter-wavelength tube is [ 99]: f0=a 4(ℓ+∆ℓ) where a=( gamma RT) 1/2 (m/s) is the speed of sound, ℓ(m) is the length of the quarter- wavelength tube, and ∆ℓ=0."
What method did Frendi et al use to determine the natural modes of vibration in the combustion chamber?,"85d(m) is the correction of the tube length ℓ. In order to determine the natural modes of vibration for a given combustion chamber, Frendi et al [ 99]p l a c e dal o u d s p e a k e ra tt h ec e n t r eo ft h ei n l e tb o u n d a r y of their combustion chamber. The loudspeaker emitted plane harmonic or random acoustic waves."
How were the vibration modes of the combustion chamber identified from the sound pressure level measurements?," A random acoustic disturbance was generated by the loudspeaker, and the sound pressure level (dB) was determined as a function of frequency at several points in the combustion chamber. By so doing, several peaks corresponding to the various vibration modes of the combustion chamber were determined. In order to determine the mode shapes, the individual modes were excited by introducing a plane, harmonic acoustic wave at the given frequency."
What natural frequency did Frendi et al select for extensive tests on their combustion chamber?," After determining the natural frequencies (512 and 1880 Hz) of their combustion chamber, Frendi et al [ 99]s e l e c t e d the frequency of 1880 Hz, corresponding to one of the natural frequencies found by them, for extensive tests. Consequently, the resonant frequency f0of the acoustic devices indicated above was tuned to 1880 Hz."
"What types of acoustic resonators utilize slots instead of circular openings, and how are they classified based on cavity width compared to slot width?"," Other types of acoustic resonators than those described above have slots instead of circular ori fices, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [74]. 194 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly They are said to be of the Helmholtz, quarter-wavelength, or intermediate type, according to whether the width of their cavities is much larger, or equal, or slightly larger in comparison with the width of their slots."
What phenomenon indicates the onset of medium-frequency instability in combustion systems?, The medium-frequency (also called buzzing) class includes pressure waves whose frequencies are in the range 180–1000 hertz [ 5]. The beginning of a medium- frequency instability usually shows a growing coherence of the combustion noise at a particular frequency with slowly increasing amplitude. There is usually wave motion in the propellant feed system.
How does the wave motion in the combustion chamber relate to the chamber's intrinsic phase and frequency?," There may also be wave motion in the combus- tion chamber, but this motion does not usually correspond in phase and frequency to an a t u r a lm o d eo ft h ec h a m b e ri t s e l f .T h es h a p eo ft h ep r e s s u r ew a v ei sv e r yn e a r l y sinusoidal, and one or both of the propellant feed system may be highly coupled."
What effects can low amplitude buzzing-type instabilities have on thrust vector and total impulse?," Buzzing-type instabilities are not particularly damaging if they remain at low ampli- tudes, but may degrade performance, total impulse, or thrust vector. In some case, the amplitude increases to such an extent as to triggering a high-frequency mode [49]. This type of instability occurs more frequently in medium-size engines (whose thrust is in the range 2000–250,000 N) than in large engines [ 2]."
What term describes the longitudinal vibrations in rocket vehicles caused by the interaction of vehicle structure and propulsion system?," Finally, many rocket vehicles propelled by engines burning liquid propellants are subject to longitudinal vibrations, because of an instability arising from interaction of the vehicle structure with the propulsion system. This phenomenon has been nicknamed pogo instability, because of its analogy with the motion of a pogo jumping stick."
What type of vehicle structures primarily experience oscillations due to pogo instabilities during the operation of their first stage with liquid propellants?," Pogo instabilities can occur in the propellant feed lines of large vehicles, such as space launch vehicles or ballistic missiles [ 2]. The oscillations due to the pogo instability occur principally in the first longitu- dinal mode of the structure during operation of the first stage (burning liquid propel- lants) of a launch vehicle."
What is the duration range for the occurrence of pogo vibrations as described?," The effects of this instability are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 101]. 2.9 Combustion Instability 195 The pogo vibrations begin spontaneously, then intensify, and finally die away in a period of time ranging from 10 to 40 s. The frequency of vibration follows the frequency of the first structural mode, which increases with the consumption of propellants."
What is the range of vibration frequencies observed during rocket vehicle operation?," Pogo vibrations have also occurred, but less often, in higher modes of longitudinal oscillation. More periods than one of instability have also been observed, each of which with its own mode of vibration, during operation of a single stage of a rocket vehicle. Vibrations have occurred in the range from 5 to 60 Hz, and vibration amplitudes (from zero to the peak values) have reached 17 g0at the input to the payload and 34 g0at the engine [ 101], where g0=9."
What devices are used in launch vehicles to minimize pogo vibrations and protect the crew and equipment?,"80665 m/s2is the acceleration of gravity at the surface of the Earth. The pogo vibrations can damage the crew and the equipment, and can also overload the structure of a rocket vehicle. In addition, they impair the propulsion performance of the vehicle. In order to suppress these vibrations, hydraulic accumulators have been installed in the propulsion systems of launch vehicles such as the Saturn V and the Space Shuttle."
What component in the Space Shuttle's engine dampens pressure oscillations linked to the oxidiser feed system?," As an example, each of the three main engines of the Space Shuttle has a pogo suppression system accumulator, which is attached to the low-pressure oxidiser duct. The accumulator, when pressurised with gaseous oxygen coming from the heat exchanger coil, dampens the pressure oscillations due to the oxidiser feed system."
What is the diameter of the hollow metallic sphere used in the thrust chamber assembly?," This accumulator is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 50]. 196 2 The Thrust Chamber Assembly It is a hollow metallic sphere, 32 cm in diameter, which is mounted by a flange to the low-pressure oxidiser duct. During engine operation, the accumulator is pres- surised with gaseous oxygen."
What role does gaseous oxygen play in relation to liquid oxygen in the accumulator?," The gaseous oxygen is a compliant medium in direct contact with the liquid oxygen, and is therefore capable of smoothing the oxidiser flow by absorbing the pressure oscillations. The pressure in the accumulator is main- tained by a constant flow of gaseous oxygen into, through, and out of the accumulator."
What is the purpose of the accumulator in relation to pogo vibrations in the Space Shuttle?," The gaseous oxygen comes from the heat exchanger coil, flows through the gaseous oxygen control valve into the accumulator, exits through the bottom of the inverted standpipe (over flow tube), and returns to the oxidiser feed system to be re-condensed in the liquid state [ 50]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 102], shows schematically how the accumulator described above is used to suppress the pogo vibrations in the Space Shuttle."

What is the function of a gas stored at high pressure in a feed system as described?," This chapter describes feed systems using gases stored at high pressures for this purpose. A scheme of such systems is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. Ag a ss t o r e du n d e rp r e s s u r em a k e si tp o s s i b l et oc o n t r o lt h ep r e s s u r ei nt h eu l l a g e space in the tanks of propellant."
What role does the pressure in the ullage space play in the operation of a rocket engine?," By ullage space we mean the volume by which a container or a tank falls short of being full of liquid. In a rocket engine fed by a gas stored under pressure, the pressure in the ullage space is used to force the propellants through the lines of the feed system and into the combustion chamber at the required pressures and flow rates."
How do pumps deliver propellants to the combustion chamber in a rocket engine?," ©T h eE d i t o r ( s )( i fa p p l i c a b l e )a n dT h eA u t h o r ( s ) ,u n d e re x c l u s i v el i c e n s e to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines , Springer Aerospace Technology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_3203 204 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure In a rocket engine fed by pumps, the pressure in the ullage space is used to supply the propellants to the inlet section of the pumps at the required pressures, and the pumps in turn deliver the propellants to the combustion chamber at the required pressures and flow rates."
What factors influence the selection of a propulsion feed system for a rocket vehicle?," As a general rule, the choice of a feed system, independently of whether it uses gases under pressure or pumps, depends on several factors, which are principally the mission which the rocket vehicle is meant to accomplish, the size and the mass of this vehicle, the intensity and the duration of the thrust, the space available to the engine, the degree of reliability of the propulsion system, and so on."
What are the thrust and mass requirements for selecting a pump-fed propulsion system?," In practice, according to Lee et al. [ 2], a pump-fed propulsion system is chosen when: •the engine must produce more than 4500 N of thrust, or •the total mass exceeds 9100 kg. In contrast, a pressure-fed propulsion system, which may be either a mono- propellant or a bi-propellant system, is chosen when: •the mission duty cycle is a pulse mode, or •the propellant mass is less than 3600 kg."
What types of gases are considered for feed systems when evaluating weight and cost trade-offs?," For those cases in which the choice of the feed system is not obvious, a weight- and-cost trade-off study is made to determine the better system. The types of gas used in the feed systems described here are the following: •gases stored for bi-propellants; •gases obtained by evaporation of two propellants; •gases stored for mono-propellants; and •gases obtained as combustion products."
What compatibility factors must be considered when selecting a type of gas for a pressurized system?," Some criteria for choosing one or another of these types are brie fly presented below. A gas under pressure must be chemically compatible with the propellants and also with the materials of which the tanks and the lines are made, at the temperatures of operation. The feed system using this gas must be simple and reliable."
What is the relationship between molar mass and the mass ratio for the rocket vehicle during launch?," The gas used in the feed system must have a low molar mass, in order for the value of the mass ratio m0/mu(where m0is the mass of the rocket vehicle at launch, and muis its mass at burnout) to be low. The materials used for the feed system must have a low speci fic mass, for the same reason. These requirements will be discussed in the following paragraphs."
What equation is used to calculate the required mass of gas when the temperature is less than or equal to the temperature of the propellants?," 3.2 Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure When the time of operation of a rocket engine is short, or when the temperature of the gas stored under pressure is less than or equal to the temperature of the propellants, then the required mass mg(kg) of that gas can be computed by means of the law of perfect gases, as follows 3."
"What variables are represented by pT, VT, Rg, and Tg in the gas storage equation?","2 Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure 205 mg=pTVT RgTg where pT(N/m2)i st h ep r e s s u r eo ft h eg a si nt h et a n k , VT(m3)i st h et o t a lv o l u m eo f the empty tank, Rg(N m kg - 1K - 1)i st h ec o n s t a n to ft h es p e c i fi cg a su s e d ,a n d Tg (K) is the mean temperature of that gas."
How can you calculate the mass of a gas under pressure when specific conditions are not met?," As has been shown in Chap. 1,S e c t .1 . 1 ,t h e constant Rgof a speci fic gas is equal to the universal gas constant R*=8314.460 N m kmol - 1K - 1divided by the molar mass M(kg/kmol) of that gas, as follows Rg=R∗ M When the conditions indicated above are not satis fied, the required mass mgof the gas under pressure can be computed as follows."
What factors influence the total heat transferred from gas to vaporised propellant in a rocket engine?," We consider first a rocket engine which is started only once, and assume the heat transfer from the tank walls to be negligible. In such conditions, the total heat Q(J) transferred from the gas under pressure to the vaporised propellant is [ 3]: Q=HA t(Tu - Te) where H(W m - 2K - 1)i st h et o t a lh e a tt r a n s f e rc o e f fi c i e n t ,w h o s ev a l u ei sd e t e r - mined experimentally, at the interface between liquid and gas, A(m2)i st h ea r e ao f the interface between liquid and gas, t(s) the duration of operation, Tu(K) is the temperature of the gases at burnout, and Te(K) is the temperature of the propellant."
What parameters are included in the equation for total heat regarding the vaporization of the propellant?," The temperatures TeandTuare assumed to have constant values at the interface between liquid and gas. The total heat Qde fined above is assumed to have heated and vaporised the propellant, as indicated by the following equation Q=mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpv(Tu - Tv) ] where mv(kg) is the total mass of vaporised propellant, cplandcpv(J kg - 1K - 1) are the speci fic heats at constant pressure of respectively the liquid propellant and the vaporised propellant, hv(J/kg) is the heat of vaporisation per unit mass of the propellant, and Tv(K) is the temperature of vaporisation of the liquid propellant."
"What is the equation for the partial volume occupied by vaporized propellant in terms of total mass, compressibility factor, and temperature?"," The equations Q = HA t(Tu - Te) and Q = mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpv(Tu - Tv) ] make it possible to compute the value ofmvfor an assumed value of Tu. The partial volume Vv(m3)o c c u p i e db yv a p o r i s e dp r o p e l l a n ti s[ 3]: Vv=mvZR pTu pT where mv(kg) is the total mass of vaporised propellant, Zis the compressibility factor evaluated at the total pressure pT(N/m2)a n da tt h et e m p e r a t u r e Tu(K) of the 206 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure gaseous mixture at burnout, and Rp(N m kg - 1K - 1)i st h ec o n s t a n to ft h es p e c i fi c propellant vapour."
How is the mass of gas under pressure calculated using the total volume of the empty tank and other variables?," The remaining volume Vg(m3)o ft h et a n ka tb u r n o u t ,i nt h ea b s e n c eo fr e s i d u a l propellants, can be assumed to be occupied by the gas under pressure, as follows Vg=VT - Vv where VT(m3)i st h et o t a lv o l u m eo ft h ee m p t yt a n k . The mass mg(kg) of the gas under pressure can be computed by means of the law of perfect gases, as follows mg=pTVg RgTu In order for the heat balance to be maintained, the total heat Q(J) must be such that Q=mgcpg ( Tg - Tu ) where cpg(J kg - 1K - 1)i st h es p e c i fi ch e a ta tc o n s t a n tp r e s s u r eo ft h eg a su n d e r pressure."
What factors must be considered to ensure the equation is satisfied when determining the mean value of gas under pressure?," The preceding equation makes it possible to determine the mean value Tg (K) of the gas under pressure for the assumed value Tu(K) of the gases at burnout. In case of the value of Tgbeing predetermined, mg,mv,a n d Tumust have values such that mgcpg ( Tg - Tu ) =mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpv(Tu - Tv) ] The preceding discussion has neglected the heat transfer through the tank walls."
"What is the variable Qw1, and how does it relate to the heat transfer between tank walls and propellants?"," On the contrary, when the gas under pressure, the propellants, and the tank walls have a considerable difference of temperature, then the total heat transferred from one to another of them must be taken into account for the purpose of determining the propellants vaporised at burnout. In these conditions, the preceding equation Q=mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpv(Tu - Tv) ] can be re-written as follows Q±Qw1=mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpy(Tu - Tv) ] where Qw1(J) is the total heat transferred between the tank walls and the liquid or gaseous propellants during a given mission."
What does the sign before Qw1 signify regarding heat interaction with the tank walls?," The sign (plus or minus) in front of Qw1 indicates whether the tank walls add or subtract heat. Likewise, the preceding equation Q=mgcpg ( Tg - Tu ) 3.2 Requirements for Gases Stored Under Pressure 207 can be re-written as follows Q=mgcpg ( Tg - Tu ) ±Qw2 where Qw2(J) is the total heat transferred between the gas under pressure and the tank walls during a given mission."
What does the sign in front of Qw2 indicate regarding heat interaction with tank walls?," The sign (plus or minus) in front of Qw2indicates whether the tank walls add or subtract heat. Consequently, the equation expressing the heat balance when the gas under pres- sure, the propellants, and the tank walls have a considerable difference of temperature can be written as follows mgcpg ( Tg - Tu ) ±Qw2=mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpv(Tu - Tv) ] - (±Qw1) When the mission to be accomplished by a space vehicle includes periods of propelled flight and periods of coasting, then the heat transfer across the gas-liquid interface must be determined by considering the total time of the mission."
What does Tm represent in the revised equation Q=HA t m(Tm - Te)?," Therefore, the preceding equation Q=HA t(Tu - Te) must be re-written as follows Q=HA t m(Tm - Te) where tm(s) is the total time of the mission including periods of propelled flight and periods of coasting, and Tm(K) is the mean temperature of the gas under pressure during the total time of the mission."
What factors influence the temperature Tm during coasting periods?," The temperature Tmdepends on several factors, which are the duration of the coasting periods, the heat transfer between the gas and the walls, etc. Other effects (vapour condensation, stability of the gas under pressure in the propellants, and chemical reactions between this gas and the propellants) can be taken into account, in case of availability of experimental data."
What is the total volume of the nitrogen tetroxide tank in cubic meters?," As an application of the concepts discussed above, we consider a rocket engine whose oxidiser and fuel are respectively nitrogen tetroxide (N 2O4)a n dh y d r a z i n e (N2H4). These propellants are fed to the thrust chamber by using helium (He) as the gas under pressure. Let VT=3.37 m3be the total volume of the empty tank of nitrogen tetroxide, A=1."
What is the total mass of the gas in kilograms stored at the inlet section of the tank?,"86 m2be the area of the average cross section of the tank, pT=1.14 ×106N/m2be the absolute pressure in the tank, and Te=289 K be the temperature of the oxidiser. As a first case, we want to calculate the total mass mg(kg) of the gas under pressure and its temperature Tg(K) at the inlet section of the tank, knowing that the duration of operation is t=500 s, and that the heat transfer coef ficient, determined experimentally, at the liquid-gas interface is H= 40."
What is the vaporization temperature of nitrogen tetroxide in Kelvin?,"9 W/(m2K). We assume the temperature of the gas at burnout to be Tu=389 K, in the absence of heat transfer at the walls of the tanks. 208 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure The following data are available for nitrogen tetroxide (N 2O4) at the pressure indicated above ( pT=1.14×106N/m2): vaporisation temperature Tv=357 K, heat of vaporisation hv=414000 J/kg, mean value of speci fic heat at constant pressure in liquid state cpl=1760 J/(kg K), mean value of speci fic heat at constant pressure in vapour state cpv=754 J/(kg K), compressibility factor Z=0."
What is the specific heat at constant pressure of helium at 293 K and atmospheric pressure?,"95, and molar mass M=2×14+4×16=92 kg/kmol. The speci fic heat at constant pressure of helium (He) at 293 K and atmospheric pressure is cpg=5190 J/(kg K) [ 4]a n di t s molar mass is M=4k g / k m o l . The total heat transferred at the gas-liquid interface results from Q=HA t(Tu - Te)=40.9×1.86×500×(389 - 289)=3."
What value of mv is obtained for the mass of vaporized propellant from the given equation?,"804×106J This value of Qand the values of the quantities cpl,cpv,hv,Tv,Te,a n d Tuare substituted into the following equation Q=mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpv(Tu - Tv) ] This yields 3.804×106=mv[1760 ×(357 - 289)+414000 +754×(389 - 357)] The preceding equation, solved for the total mass mvof vaporised propellant, yields mv=3."

What values are needed to determine the total mass of gas and its temperature at the tank's inlet section for a mission duration of 18000 seconds?,"804×106 4.469×5190=553 K Now, as a second case, we want to calculate the total mass mg(kg) of the gas under pressure and its temperature Tg(K) at the inlet section of the tank, for a mission which includes periods of propelled flight and periods of coasting, and has a total duration tm=18000 s. The mean temperature of the gas under pressure during this mission isTm=292 K."
What does a negative value for Qw1 and Qw2 indicate about the heat transfer between the tank walls and the respective substances?," The total heat transferred between the tank walls and the propellant isQw1= - 2.11 ×106J, where the minus sign indicates that the tank walls subtract heat from the propellant. The total heat transferred between the gas under pressure and the tank walls is Qw2= - 0.633 ×106J, where the minus sign indicate that the tank walls subtract heat from the gas under pressure."
What is the calculated total mass of the vaporised propellant based on the given heat transfer equation?," The temperature of the gases at burnout is Tu=367 K. The total heat Qtransferred from the gas under pressure to the vaporised propellant at the gas-liquid interface is Q=HA t m(Tm - Te)=40.9×1.86×18000 ×(292 - 289)=4.108×106J This value of Qand the values of the quantities Qw1,cpl,cpv,hv,Tv,Te,a n d Tu are substituted into the following equation Q±Qw1=mv [ cpl(Tv - Te)+hv+cpv(Tu - Tv) ] Consequently, the total mass mvof vaporised propellant is mv=4."

The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5], shows the position of the spherical vessel of helium in the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module."
What are the advantages of using helium in feed systems for bi-propellants?," 3.3 Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Bi-Propellants 211 Helium is preferred to other gases for the following reasons: •low molar mass ( M=4k g / k m o l )a n dt h e r e f o r el o wt o t a lm a s s ; •low boiling point (4.22 K at atmospheric pressure); and •absence of chemical reactivity. In case of a bi-propellant engine using liquid hydrogen as its fuel, gaseous hydrogen has also been used as the pressurising agent."
What was the gas used in the Lunar Orbiter's velocity and reaction control system that did not involve thermal conditioning?," Helium or other pressurised gases can be stored in a vessel with or without a system for thermal conditioning. A thermal conditioning (that is, heating or cooling or both) of the gas can lead to low-mass systems. On the other hand, a thermal conditioning of the gas implies high complexity and cost. A successful system which did not condition thermally the stored gas (nitrogen) was the Lunar Orbiter velocity and reaction control system."
What percentage of mass reduction occurs with helium stored under supercritical conditions compared to high-pressure storage without thermal conditioning?," By contrast, in the descent stage illustrated above of the Apollo lunar module, helium under pressure was stored under supercritical conditions and then heated. This led to a reduction in mass of 60% over that of an ambient- temperature high-pressure storage without thermal conditioning. These two systems of storage are brie fly described below."
What is the thrust force produced by the engine in the Lunar Orbiter IV's velocity and reaction control system?," The velocity and reaction control system of the Lunar Orbiter IV is shown schematically in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6]. This system was designed so that its 445-N-thrust engine, using a hypergolic combination of oxidiser (N 2O4)a n df u e l( A e r o z i n e - 5 0 ) ,c o u l di m p a r tav e l o c i t y change of 1017 m/s to the 387 kg spacecraft for mid-course corrections, injection into an initial lunar orbit, and successive injection into a photographic orbit."
What is the mass of the nitrogen gas stored in the spherical tank?," The source of ullage gas was a spherical tank containing gaseous nitrogen (N 2)w i t h o u t provision for conditioning the temperature of this gas. The tank was made of Ti– 6Al–4V alloy, with a mass of 9.9 kg and an internal volume of 0.0259 m3.Am a s s of 6.56 kg of nitrogen was stored into this sphere at a pressure of 2."
What is the pressure exerted by the gas in the storage vessel?,"4 ×107N/m2 and at a temperature of 294 K. Two parallel-redundant normally-closed squib valves isolated the pressurising gas in the storage vessel from the rest of the system until the gas was required for its first use. The gas in the storage vessel was also the source for the cold-gas reaction control system, which is shown in the lower portion of the preceding figure."
What pressure is maintained by the pressure regulator for the velocity control system after the pressurising gas flows through the shut-off squib valve?," Only part (from 0.91 to 1.36 kg) of the nitrogen mass in the storage vessel was used to generate and maintain the pressure in the propellant tanks for the velocity control system; the remaining part was used for the reaction control system and for reserve of pressurising gas. When the squib valves were opened, the pressurising gas flowed through a normally-open shut-off squib valve to the pressure regulator of the velocity control system, which reduced the pressure of the gas to 1."
What was implemented in the velocity control system to maintain propellant mixture ratio during flight?,"3×106N/m2.T h eg a sw a st h e nr o u t e dt h r o u g ht h ec h e c kv a l v e sa n di n t ot h e oxidiser and fuel tanks. In the velocity control system, a single regulator was used to pressurise both of the propellant tanks, in order to preclude undesired in- flight shifts of propellant mixture ratio; such shifts could occur if each tank had its own pressure regulator and the regulator set-point of one changed during flight."
How do check valves function in preventing propellant vapour from affecting connected tanks?," With a single regulator, the set-point could still change, but each tank could have the same ullage pressure. Though each tank had a bladder, check valves were used to isolate the ullage gases of the fuel and oxidiser tanks. If any propellant vapour permeated one of 212 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure such bladders, the check valves prevented the vapour from entering the other system."
What was the purpose of the shut-off squib valve after the velocity control system's function was completed?," After the velocity control system completed its function, the normally-open shut-off squib valve was set to the closed position, in order to isolate the velocity control system regulator and tankage from the gas in the storage vessel. Each ullage had a pressure relief system to protect the system from over-pressures."
How many engine firings experienced leakages in the pressurisation system of the Lunar Orbiter's velocity and reaction control system?, The pressurisation system of the Lunar Orbiter velocity and reaction control system was subject to leakages only two times during twenty-eight engine firings in five different missions [2]. The descent stage of the Apollo lunar module used just the same combination of hypergolic propellants (N 2O4as the oxidiser and Aerozine-50 as the fuel) as that used by the Lunar Orbiter velocity and reaction control system.
What was the storage capacity of the supercritical helium vessel used in the Apollo lunar module's descent stage?," In the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module, a double-walled, Mylar®-insulated, high-pressure, cryo- genic vessel was used to store 22 kg of supercritical helium for the pressurisation system. The helium tank was loaded with liquid helium at 4.4 K and topped with 3.3 Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Bi-Propellants 213 high-pressure gaseous helium, which increased the system temperature to approx- imately 6–7 K."
What was the maximum temperature achieved by helium before it flowed out during the standby period?," During the 131-h (maximum) standby period, the helium pressure and temperature were increased by incoming heat leak. The maximum temperature reached by helium prior to out flow was 28 K, and the rate of pressure rise ranged from 9.6 to 19.2 N/(m2s). The feed system for the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module is illustrated schematically in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5]."
What is the maximum flow rate of helium fluid passed through the initial loop of the two-pass heat exchanger?," With reference to the colours shown in the preceding figure, the helium fluid (cyan) passed at a maximum flow rate of 0.000668 kg/s through the first loop of the external two-pass fuel-to-helium heat exchanger, where it absorbed heat from the fuel (red). Then, the helium (dark green) was warmed and routed back through the internal helium-to-helium heat exchanger inside the cryogenic storage vessel."
What temperature was the helium heated to before being delivered as the pressurising agent for the fuel and oxidiser tanks?," The warm helium transferred heat to the remaining supercritical helium in the cryogenic storage 214 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure vessel, and caused an increase in pressure, so that continuous expulsion of helium was ensured throughout the period of operation. After the helium passed through the internal helium-to-helium heat exchanger, where it was cooled, it was routed back (light green) through the second loop of the fuel-to-helium heat exchanger, and was heated to approximately 278 K before being delivered (medium green) as the pressurising agent for the fuel (red) and oxidiser (blue) tanks of the propulsion system."
What benefits did the supercritical-helium storage tank and passive control configuration provide for the Apollo lunar module's descent stage?, The use of a supercritical-helium storage tank and passive control con figuration for the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module reduced the number of components required and resulted in a high degree of reliability [ 2]. The pressurisation systems described above are only two particular examples of component combinations.
What factors affect the gross mass of the stored gas in propellant tanks?," Further combinations can be found in [ 7]. The requirements for the gas under pressure, which have been considered in Sect. 3.2,a p p l yo n l yt ot h en e to re f f e c t i v em a s s mgof gas necessary to pressurise the tanks of propellant. However, the gross mass msof the stored gas depends also on the system design, on the gas expansion during operation, and on the range of the environmental temperature."
What is the equation that defines the gross mass of stored gas based on its components?," The gross mass msof the stored gas results from a sum, whose addends are the net mass mgof the stored gas, the mass msvof the residual gas in the storage vessel, the mass mdof the residual gas in the lines downstream of the regulator, the mass mexof the residual mass in the heat exchanger, etc., as follows ms=mg+msv+md+mex+."
"What defines the ratio of the gross mass to the net mass of the pressurizing gas, which is greater than one?",".. Ap a r a m e t e rw h i c ht a k e sa c c o u n to ft h ea d d i t i o n a lt e r m si n d i c a t e da b o v ei st h e use factor of the pressurising gas. This parameter, whose value is greater than unity, is de fined as the ratio ms/mgof the gross mass to the net mass of the pressuring gas. The lowest value of pressure in a storage vessel depends on the values of the pressure drops in the various components (regulator, heat exchanger, etc."
What is the pressure value at which the pressurising action of a stored gas ceases in its storage vessel?,") which make up a feed system and also on a safety value. The pressurising action of a stored gas is considered to have come to an end when the pressure in its storage vessel decays to 2.758 ×106N/m2[3]. When a source of heat is present inside the storage vessel, then the expansion of the gas in the vessel is assumed to be polytropic ( pVn=constant), that is, such as to involve a transfer of heat and work."
What is the relationship between the final temperature T2 and the initial temperature T1 during an isentropic process without heat transfer?," By contrast, when no source of heat is present in the storage vessel, then the expansion of the gas in the vessel can be assumed to be isentropic ( pV gamma =constant), that is, frictionless and without heat transfer between the gas and the vessel walls. The following equation can be used to calculate the final temperature T2(K) of the gas in the storage vessel T2 T1= ( p2 p1 ) n - 1 n where T1(K) is the initial temperature of the gas in the storage vessel, nis the exponent of the polytropic expansion, and p2(N/m2)a n d p1(N/m2) are respectively the final pressure and the initial pressure in the storage vessel."
What is the value of the exponent \( n \) during isentropic expansion of helium?," 3.3 Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Bi-Propellants 215 The value of the exponent nis first estimated, and then veri fied experimentally. In case of an isentropic expansion of helium, n= gamma =cp/cv=1.667 [ 4]. In most cases, the expansion process through the regulator and the lines can be considered adiabatic, so that the total temperature remains constant."
What values are used to calculate the mass of pressurizing gas and volume of the storage vessel in a pressure-feed system?," This expansion comes to an end in the propellant tanks. The temperature of the propellants in the tanks is assumed to be equal to the temperature at the outlet section of the heat exchanger. For a speci fied range of temperatures in a pressure-feed system, the lower value can be used to determine the mass of the pressurising gas, and the upper value can be used to determine the volume of the storage vessel, for a given storage pressure [ 3]."
What is the temperature range in the storage vessel at the beginning of the isentropic expansion process?," In the following example of application, an isentropic expansion process is assumed to occur in the oxidiser (N 2O4)t a n ko fap r e s s u r e - f e ds y s t e mh a v i n gt h e following properties: temperature range 278–311 K in the storage vessel at the system start, pressure ps=3.1×107N/m2in the storage vessel at the system start, pressure pu=2."

What structural technique supports loads through the outer skin of a vessel without internal framework?," Such vessels are usually of monocoque design, operate at high stress levels, are mounted within the rocket vehicle, and are insulated from de flec- tion of the vehicle structure by appropriately designed mountings [ 2]. By the way, monocoque (a French word meaning single shell) is a structural technique in which ab o d ys u p p o r t sl o a d st h r o u g hi t se x t e r n a ls k i n ,w i t hn oi n t e r n a lf r a m et oh o l dt h e body rigid."
"How is the mass of a spherical storage vessel calculated in relation to its thickness, inside diameter, and density?"," The alloy most often used to construct storage vessels is Ti–6Al–4V [ 8]. An estimate for the mass m(kg) of a spherical vessel of thickness t(m), inside diameter d(m), and made of a material having uniform density rho (kg/m3)c a nb e made as follows m= rho V=4 3π rho [ ( d 2+t ) 3 - ( d 2 ) 3 ] 3.3 Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Bi-Propellants 223 Another estimate, suggested by Huzel and Huang [ 3], for the same mass m(kg) can be made by assuming a vessel made of two hemispherical shells, such that the thickness of the weld lands is taken into account by assuming a band of width w(m) and thickness equal to one-half the wall thickness placed over the weld seam."
What variables in the estimate determine the maximum pressure that the storage vessel can withstand?," This estimate is m=πd3 rho /parenleftBigp 4σ/parenrightBig +39.37πwd2 rho /parenleftBigp 8σ/parenrightBig where p(N/m2)i st h em a x i m u mp r e s s u r ea tw h i c ht h eg a si ss t o r e d ,a n d σ(N/m2) is the allowable working stress of the material of which the vessel is made. The storage vessel must be capable of containing the gas at high pressure for long periods of time without losses due to leakage."
What factors influence the leakage of gases through homogeneous metals and porous metals?," Gases having low molar masses, such as hydrogen and helium, are less subject to leak through homogeneous metals of good quality than is the case with those having high molar masses. Leakages can occur through porous metals, for example, through castings and welded joints. The pressure-fed systems cited above (used for the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module and for the velocity and reaction control system of the Lunar Orbiter) have, each of them, a pressure regulator for the gases (respectively, helium and nitrogen) stored under pressure."
What mechanism does the pressure regulator employ to achieve sealing to the seat in the described propulsion module?," A regulator maintains the desired values of flow and pressure to the propellant tanks as the pressure of the stored gas decreases. The example described below refers to a pressure regulator used for the Space Storable Propulsion Module, which was used for a Jupiter Orbiter mission. With reference to the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 9], this pressure regulator has an unbalanced poppet, which achieves sealing to the seat by means of the upstream pressure force."
What component maintains the null position of the actuation mechanism in the described system?," In addition, the poppet is held against the seat by an axial guidance flexure. The actuation mechanism consists of a bellows, which is exposed to space inter- nally and to the regulator downstream pressure externally, and which is held in the null position by one or more coil springs. If the regulator downstream pressure decreases from the preset pressure, the reference spring force overcomes the bellows pressure force and the actuator exerts a net opening force on the poppet through the lever arrangement."
What happens to the poppet when the net force exceeds the force required to seat it?," When this net force is greater than the poppet seating force, the poppet opens and allows the gas (helium) under pressure to pressurise the downstream side of the regulator. When the downstream regulator pressure rises back up to the set pressure, the actuator returns to the null position and the poppet is caused to return to the seat by the axial guidance flexure spring force and the difference of pressure across the poppet [ 9]."
How can the heat exchanger be configured to integrate with the nozzle design in gas feed systems?," 224 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure The heat exchanger, which warms the gas under pressure, may be designed to form an integral part of the diverging portion of the nozzle, as shown in the following figure.

The number of turns in the heat exchanger around the nozzle depends on the required increase in temperature of the pressurising gas and also on the position of the heat exchanger along the nozzle."
What does the variable 'A' represent in the equation for temperatures in a heat exchanger?," The various temperatures in the elements of the heat exchanger can be expressed by means of the following equation [ 3]: . mhcp(To - Ti)=A ( 1 hg+t k+1 hh ) - 1 ( Taw - Ti+To 2 ) where . mh(kg/s) is the mass flow rate of the pressurising gas, cp(J kg - 1K - 1)i s the speci fic heat at constant pressure of the pressurising gas, Ti(K) is the mean temperature of the pressurising gas at the inlet section of the heat exchanger, To (K) is the mean temperature of the pressurising gas at the outlet section of the heat exchanger, A(m2)i st h ee f f e c t i v ea r e ao ft h eh e a te x c h a n g e r , hg(W m - 2K - 1)i st h e heat transfer coef ficient on the side of the combusted gas, t(m) is the thickness of the tube of the heat exchanger, k(W m - 1K - 1)i st h et h e r m a lc o n d u c t i v i t yo ft h em a t e r i a l of which this tube is made, and Taw(K) is the adiabatic wall temperature on the side of the combusted gas."
What factors influence the temperature of the gas exiting the heat exchanger?," The temperature of the pressurising gas which leaves the heat exchanger at any time also depends on the temperature of the same gas at the exit section of the storage vessel. The material, of which the tube of the heat exchanger is made, is to be chosen by the designer bearing in mind the necessity of attaching firmly by brazing the tube to the wall of the nozzle."
How is the width of the tube in a heat exchanger influenced by the external factors it experiences?," The width of this tube depends on the thermal and mechanical loads to which the tube is subject. The following example of application concerns the design of a heat exchanger of the type illustrated above, used in parallel with other heat exchangers and placed at the cross-section of area ratio A/At=10 of a nozzle extension for a rocket engine of known characteristics."

Where does the highest temperature of the tube wall occur in relation to the pressurising gas within the heat exchanger?,"30. For each chosen section of the heat exchanger, the temperature of the tube at the wall depends on the bulk temperature of the pressurising gas (helium) at that section. Since the pressurising gas absorbs heat from the nozzle, the maximum temperature occurs at the outlet section of the heat exchanger."

What is the impact of oxidiser vapour's molar mass on the mass of pressurising gas needed for liquid hydrogen systems?," However, liquid hydrogen, which is a fuel, is an exception to this rule.

What role does the heat exchanger play in the feed systems using two propellants for pump-fed rocket engines?," 3.3. This undesirable effect is counterbalanced by the elimination of storage vessels, because in feed systems using evaporation of two propellants the pressurising agent is stored as a liquid in the tank containing the main propellant.

What components make up the shell assembly of the heat exchanger utilized in the J-2 rocket engine?," 232 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure This particular heat exchanger, which has been used for the J-2 rocket engine, is a shell assembly, consisting of a duct, bellows, flanges, and coils. It is mounted in the turbine exhaust duct between the oxidiser turbine discharge manifold and the thrust chamber."
What type of gas is converted from liquid oxygen for use in the second stage of the Saturn V rocket's oxidiser tank?," It heats and expands gaseous helium for use in the third stage of the Saturn V rocket or converts liquid oxygen to gaseous oxygen for the second stage for maintaining pressurisation in the oxidiser tank of the vehicle. During engine operation, either liquid oxygen is tapped off the oxidiser high-pressure duct or helium is provided from the vehicle stage and routed to the heat exchanger coils [ 16]."
What role do heat exchangers play in the operation of Titan rockets with nitrogen tetroxide?," Heat exchangers have also been employed on the Titan rockets to vaporise liquid nitrogen tetroxide to be used as the pressurising agent [ 2]. As has been shown above, evaporated-propellant pressurisation is successful with cryogenic propellants and also with the storable oxidiser nitrogen tetroxide, whose boiling point is 294."
What occurs in a heated liquid when its pressure is lower than the saturation vapor pressure?,"2 K. The simplest method of evaporated-propellant pressurisation is self-pressurisation ( flash boiling) in a propellant tank during feed-out. By the way, flash boiling is the phenomenon which occurs in a heated liquid whose pressure is lower than the saturation vapour pressure of the liquid. When the pressure falls suf ficiently below the saturation vapour pressure, then rapid boiling of the liquid can result."
What challenges arise from the mass requirements of the pressurising agent in the self-pressurisation method?," The self-pressurisation method is reliable, but the mass requirements of the pres- surising agent are high, because of its low temperature, and hence of its high density. In addition, pre-pressurisation from a separate system may be necessary to meet engine start requirements, as was the case with the Centaur rocket vehicle [ 2]."
How is higher pressure achieved in systems using propellants?," In this case, the vapour pressure of bulk propellants (hydrogen and oxygen) boiling in the tanks was used to provide the modest pressure required at the inlet of tank- mounted boost pumps. In systems requiring higher pressures, superheated vapour is obtained by passing the propellant through an engine heat exchanger or some other heat source, as will be shown below."
What factors contribute to optimal conditions in the ullage space during pressurization?," More favourable conditions exist in the ullage space when the pressurising agent is heated to the maximum temperature compatible with structural and propellant requirements, and when the temperature of the gas in the ullage space is strati fied, that is, controlled by heating or cooling at the tank wall and upper bulkhead [ 2]."
What method was utilized for pressurising both the oxidiser and fuel systems in the second stage of the Saturn V rocket?," In the S-II (meaning by this name the second stage of the Saturn V rocket), which used evaporated-propellant pressurisation in both oxidiser and fuel systems, propellant vapour was superheated to reduce the mass of gas required to the minimum. For main stage pressurisation, the oxidiser tank of the S-II was pressurised with warm gaseous oxygen (275 ±8Ka tt h em a x i m u mm i x t u r er a t i o ,a n d2 5 0 ±8Ka tl o w mixture ratio)."
What temperature is the liquid oxygen when extracted for the pressurising agent?," As shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 2], the pressurising agent for the oxygen was obtained by extracting a portion of the liquid oxygen (at a temperature of approximately 94 K) leaving the discharge area of the pump and routing this fluid through the shell-and-tube heat exchanger, which has been shown in the preceding figure."
What temperature range is the turbine outlet gas at a low mixture ratio?," The turbine outlet gas provided the heat source (at 598 ±30 K at the maximum mixture ratio, and 548 ±35 K at low mixture ratio) for the heat exchanger. Within the heat exchanger, the liquid oxygen was vaporised and then routed into a collector. From there, the gaseous oxygen was routed into the ullage space of the oxygen tank through a flow restrictor and gas distributor."
What was the temperature range of the pressurising hydrogen in the S-II fuel tank at maximum mixture ratio?," 3.4 Feed Systems Using Evaporation of Two Propellants 233 The fuel tank of the S-II was pressurised with gaseous hydrogen extracted from the cooling jacket of the thrust chamber, where this fluid was used as a coolant. The temperature of the pressurising hydrogen ranged from 111 ±11 K at the maximum mixture ratio to 72 ±17 K at low mixture ratio."
How is the mass flow rate of each propellant influenced in the tanks?," The pressurising hydrogen was collected from the four outboard engines and was routed to the ullage space via the hydrogen-tank flow-control ori fice and gas distributor. The pressure in both of the propellant tanks can be adjusted by means of valves or regulators, as has been shown above. The mass flow rate of each propellant (oxidiser or fuel) required for vaporisation and pressurisation depends on the mass flow rate of that propellant at the pump inlet (or at the tank outlet) and also on the heat and mass transfer processes which occur in the propellant tanks."
What factors influence the mass flow rate of the propellant at the pump inlet for each rocket stage engine?," These processes, in 234 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure turn, depend on the temperature of the environment and on the temperature of the pressurising agent. Let . m(kg/s) be the propellant mass flow rate at the pump inlet for each of the N engines of a rocket stage, pT(N/m2)b ep r e s s u r eo fo n eo ft h ep r o p e l l a n t s( o x i d i s e ro r fuel) in the tank, rho (kg/m3)b et h ed e n s i t yo ft h el i q u i dp r o p e l l a n t , R(N m kg - 1K - 1) be the speci fic gas constant of the vaporised propellant, T(K) be the temperature of the gas in the ullage space of the tank, ."
What equation can be used to determine the required flow rate of propellant for tank pressurisation based on evaporation and average flow rates?," me(kg/s) be the mass flow rate of evaporation of the propellant, and . mv(kg/s) be the average flow rate of the propellant through the tank vent. When the values of these quantities are known, then the required flow rate of propellant . mp(kg/s), for each engine, tapped off for tank pressurisation can be determined by means of the following equation [ 3]: ."

What specific impulse range is associated with traditional mono-propellants used in certain feed systems for gases?,"5 Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Mono-Propellants These feed systems have not been employed frequently so far, because of the low speci fic impulses (230–240 s) which can be obtained by using traditional mono- propellants. One of these system was employed for the orbit adjust subsystem (OAS) of the Landsat satellites, which used a hydrazine (N 2H4)p r o p e l l a n tt a n kw i t ha bladder and nitrogen (N 2) as the pressurising gas [ 2]."
What type of compounds are being investigated to replace hydrazine as green propellants?," They have recently attracted considerable interest during continuous efforts aimed at replacing hydrazine with one of the so-called green propellants, which are less toxic and easier to handle and store than hydrazine. The chemical substances considered for this purpose are ionic compounds used in concentrated aqueous solutions."
What is the temperature at which ionic compounds are considered to be liquid in the context of oxidisers and reducers?," Each of these compounds contains an ionic liquid (oxidiser) and a fuel (reducer). By ionic liquids we mean ionic compounds (salts) which are liquid below 373 K. More commonly, ionic liquids have melting points below room temperature [ 17]. According to Fahrat et al. [ 18], some of these oxidisers are: •HAN (hydroxyl ammonium nitrate) [NH 3OH]+[NO 3] - •ADN (ammonium dinitramide) [NH 4]+[N(NO 2)2] - •HFN (hydrazinium nitroformate) [N 2H5]+[C(NO 2)3] - •AN (ammonium nitrate) [NH 4]+[NO 3] - •HN (hydrazinium nitrate) [N 2H5]+[NO 3] - According to the same authors [ 18], ionic or molecular fuels associated with these oxidisers are: •TEAN (trisethanol ammonium nitrate) [NH(C 2H4OH) 3]+[NO 3] - •AA (ammonium azide) [NH 4]+[N3] - •HA (hydrazinium azide) [N 2H5]+[N3] - •HEHN (2-hydroxyethilhydrazinium nitrate) [HO-C 2H4-N2H4]+[NO 3] - •Methanol, ethanol, glycerol, glycine, urea As has been shown in Chap."
"What is the chemical formula for hydroxyl ammonium nitrate, and what are its constituent compounds?"," 1,S e c t .1 . 4 ,o fa l lt h eo x i d i s e r si n d i c a t e da b o v e , those which have been attracted particular interest are hydroxyl ammonium nitrate and ammonium dinitramide. Hydroxyl ammonium nitrate, also known as HAN, is a salt derived from hydroxyl amine (NH 2OH) and nitric acid (HNO 3)."
What is the specific impulse of the hydroxyl ammonium nitrate-based propellant AF-M315E?," The Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA, has developed a hydroxyl ammonium nitrate-based propellant known as AF-M315E. This propellant is less toxic and easier to handle than hydrazine, and has a speci fic impulse Is=257 s, which is about 12% greater than the speci fic impulse of hydrazine, the latter being Is=230 s."
What components are combined to create the liquid mono-propellant LMP-103S?," Gaseous ammonium dinitramide decomposes under heat into ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2O), and nitric acid (HNO 3). The Swedish company EURENCO Bofors produces a liquid mono-propellant, called LMP-103S, as a substitute for hydrazine by dissolving 65% ammonium dinitramide in 35% water solution of methanol (CH 3OH) and ammonia (NH 3)."
What are the specific impulse and impulse density advantages of LMP-103S compared to hydrazine mono-propellant?," LMP-103S has 6% higher speci fic impulse and 30% higher impulse density (see below) than hydrazine mono-propellant [ 20]. LMP-103S has been tested in the PRISMA (Prototype Research Instruments and Space Mission technology Advancement, COSPAR designation 2010-028B and 2010-028F) mission in 2010. The following table, adapted from [ 21], shows some performance data of the LMP-103S and AF-M315E mono-propellants in comparison with hydrazine."
What are the two mono-propellants compared to hydrazine in the provided table?," The following table, from [ 21], shows some compatibility and handling properties of the LMP-103S and AF-M315E mono-propellants in comparison with hydrazine. 3.5 Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Mono-Propellants 237 The following figure (re-drawn from [ 22]) illustrates the feed system used in a spacecraft during the PRISMA mission."
How many mono-propellant thrusters are included in the described system?," This system consists of one propellant tank with an internal flexible diaphragm, two service valves, one pressure transducer, one filter system, one isolation latch valve, and two 1-N mono-propellant thrusters. The tank contains 5.6 kg of LMP- 103S propellant. All of these components are of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) type used for hydrazine thrusters."
What is the initial pressure in Pascals of the system at 293 K?, The tubes are 6 mm in diameter and are made of corrosion-resistant steel. All the components are welded to the tubes. The feed pressure decreases in proportion to the consumed propellant. The initial pressure is 2.2 ×106N/m2at 293 K. This value decreases to 0.5 ×106N/m2when all propellant is consumed.
What is the initial thrust value before the decrease occurs?," The thrust decreases from an initial value of 1 N to a final value of 0.25 N. The propellant and the gas (helium) under pressure are stored in the same tank and are separated by means of a flexible diaphragm. The gas acts on 238 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure this diaphragm by pushing the propellant through the system filter to the control valve, which controls the flow of propellant to the thruster."
What components are involved in determining the appropriate propellant quantity before thruster firing?," The thruster requires pre-heating before firing. When the firing command is given, the series redundant flow control valve opens and admits the propellant in the thrust chamber. There, the propellant decomposes and ignites in the pre-heated reactor bed. This generates hot gases and hence thrust. The pressure transducer and the tank temperature sensor are used to determine the correct amount of propellant."
What is the temperature range maintained by the thermal control unit during the mission?," All components are powered by ar e m o t et e r m i n a lu n i tw i t h2 8 ±1Vo fd i r e c tc u r r e n t .T h et e m p e r a t u r eo ft h i su n i t is controlled by a thermal control remote terminal unit, and is kept in the range of 283–323 K during the entire mission [ 22]. The following figure (re-drawn from [ 19]) illustrates the feed system to be used in the GPIM (Green Propellant Infusion Mission)."
What components make up the AF-M315E propellant feed system used in NASA's 2018 mission?," In this mission [ 23], scheduled for 2018, NASA wants to demonstrate the practical capabilities of the AF-M315E propellant. This feed system consists principally of one propellant tank with an internal flexible diaphragm, two service valves, two pressure transducers, one filter, one flow restrictor, one isolation latch valve, four 1- Nt h r u s t e r sf o ra t t i t u d ec o n t r o l ,a n do n e2 2 - Np r i m a r yd i v e r tt h r u s t e r ."
What type of gas is stored under pressure over the diaphragm in the system?,"E a c ho ft h e s e thrusters has a single-seat valve and a temperature sensor. The feed system operates in blow-down mode, which means that the pressure decreases in proportion to the amount of consumed propellant. The gas stored under pressure over the diaphragm is nitrogen. The system components used for AF-M315E are in many cases those used for hydrazine."
What is the minimum start temperature requirement for the 1-N and 22-N thrusters due to the catalyst used?," The 1-N thrusters and the 22-N thruster require a pre-heating of the catalyst bed before firing. The power requirements relating to this pre-heating are high, due to the elevated minimum start temperature of the thrusters. These thrusters use the LCH-240 high-temperature long-life catalyst developed by Aerojet 3."
What materials are utilized for the thrust chamber and nozzle in Mono-Propellant systems using AF-M315E?,"5 Feed Systems Using Gases Stored for Mono-Propellants 239 Rocketdyne. The use of refractory alloys, necessary to withstand the high flame temperature of the AF-M315E propellant, is con fined to the thrust chamber, the nozzle, and an upper thermal isolation structure. The other parts of the thrusters can be made of conventional alloys used for hydrazine thrusters [ 19]."
Who manufactured the BCP100 spacecraft?," The BCP100 spacecraft, manufactured by Ball Aerospace, and its propulsion system described above are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Aerojet Rocketdyne [ 24]. The criteria of design and the methods of calculation for the feed systems described here are similar to those described in Sect."
What methods are used to obtain pressurising gas in a system employing combustion products?," 3.3. 3.6 Feed Systems Using Combustion Products In a feed system using combustion products, the pressurising gas is obtained by combustion of propellants in a turbine gas generator, or by combustion in a solid- propellant gas generator, or by injection of a hypergolic fluid into the main propellant tank."
What limitations are associated with the pressurising gas used in small military vehicles and Titan stages?," This system has been used to supply pressurising gas in several small military vehicles, and also to pressurise the fuel tanks of the Titan stages. It has rarely been used, because the pressurising gas is chemically incompatible with the propellants, or has a temperature too high, or has condensible elements."
What propellants are utilized in the rocket engine for the Titan stages?," A scheme of the feed system used in the Titan stages is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 2]. 240 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure The rocket engine uses nitrogen tetroxide (N 2O4)a st h eo x i d i s e ra n dA e r o z i n e 50 as the fuel. The gas generator uses the engine propellants to produce fuel-rich exhaust gases which drive the engine turbo-pumps."
What is the temperature range at which the pressurizing gas is injected into the fuel tank?," The combustion temperature in this gas generator is about 1256 K at a fuel-rich mixture ratio o/f=0.085. The temperature at the turbine outlet is about 1183 K. The pressurising gas is tapped off at the turbine outlet, passed through a gas cooler, and then routed to the fuel tank. It is injected into the fuel tank within a temperature range of 361 K to 417 K."
What component regulates the flow of gas downstream of the cooler in the gas generator system?," The flow of the pressurising gas is controlled by a flow-control nozzle located downstream of the gas cooler [ 2]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 3], shows a solid-propellant gas generator, which is a small device burning a solid propellant to supply hot gas under pressure to the main liquid propellants."
What components make up the gas generator used in a system employing combustion products for rocket engine pressurization?," 3.6 Feed Systems Using Combustion Products 241 Ag a sg e n e r a t o rl i k et h i sc a nb ee m p l o y e dt op r e s s u r i s et a n k so fr o c k e te n g i n e s using storable liquid propellants. This gas generator consists of two electrically- fired initiators (squibs), one charge of igniter pellets, some safety and arming devices, one regulator of the pressure-relief type, and two solid-propellant grains."
What material is used for the main propellant tank encasing the gas generator?," There may also be, in some cases, a device to cool the hot gas produced. The gas generator illustrated above is contained in an insulated housing made of steel. This housing, in turn, is contained in the main propellant tank, which is made of an aluminium alloy. The gas outlets are hermetically sealed by means of burst diaphragms which assure a safe storage of the solid propellant over long periods of time."
How do igniter pellets influence the performance of propellant grains during combustion?," At the proper moment, the propellant grains are ignited by the igniter pellets. The gases generated by the combustion process pressurise the main propellants for the duration of the propellant grains. Such grains are designed to produce the desired pressures and flow rates within a given range of temperature."
What happens to excess gases when the maximum temperature limit is surpassed?," In case of the upper limit of temperature being exceeded, a regulator discharges overboard the excess gases. Some types of solid-propellant gas generators used for feed systems are brie fly described below. The following figure illustrates two solid-propellant gas generators, one of which without cooling and the other with a solid coolant."
What components are included in the gas generator mentioned?," 242 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure The gas generator shown in the upper part of the preceding figure consists of a solid-propellant charge with igniter, a filter, and a hot-gas regulator or an ori fice. This type of gas generator can be used only for short periods of time. When the solid propellant is ignited, the hot gases are passed through the filter, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks."
"What components are included in the gas generator described, specifically involved in the process of excess gas management?"," The regulator or the ori fice mentioned above dumps overboard the excess gas, and therefore a vent line must be present for this purpose. The gas generator shown in the lower part of the preceding figure consists of as o l i d - p r o p e l l a n tc h a r g ew i t hi g n i t e r ,as u b l i m a t i n gs o l i dc o o l a n t ,a fi l t e r ,a n da regulator."
What occurs when the solid material either decomposes or sublimates during the cooling of hot gases from ignited propellant?," When the solid propellant is ignited, the hot gases are cooled by passing through a solid material which decomposes or sublimates. This cooling process generates additional gases. The mixture of gases generated in this manner is passed through the filter, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks."
What solid propellant is described as having a flame temperature of approximately 1544 K?," Huzel and Huang [ 3]d e s c r i b eag a sg e n e r a t o ru s i n ga m m o n i u mn i t r a t e( N H 4NO 3) as the solid propellant, which has a flame temperature of about 1544 K. The ammo- nium nitrate is used with a solid coolant made of oxalic acid (HOOCCOOH or (COOH) 2)c o m p r e s s e di n t op e l l e t s ."
What gases are produced when oxalic acid decomposes thermally at temperatures above 394 K?,"O x a l i ca c i dd e c o m p o s e se n d o t h e r m i c a l l y ,a ta temperature above 394 K, and produces a mixture of gases consisting of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and water (H 2O). The desired temperature is obtained by adjusting the ratio of the propellant to the coolant. By so doing, a temperature of 478 K has been reached [ 3]."
What substance decomposes at around 573 K to produce nitrogen gas and sodium particles in the gas generator?," The following figure illustrates a solid-propellant gas generator having an azide cooling pack. 3.6 Feed Systems Using Combustion Products 243 In this gas generator, the hot gas resulting from the combustion of a solid propellant is cooled by passing through an azide material. An example of this material is sodium azide (NaN 3), which decomposes after being heated at or above approximately 573 K into gaseous nitrogen (N 2)a n ds o d i u m( N a )p a r t i c l e s ,a sf o l l o w s 2NaN 3→2Na+3N2 These particles are removed when the gas containing them passes through a cyclone separator."
What temperature is achieved by the gas generator for gaseous nitrogen production?," The gas coming from this separator is filtered to remove further particles, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks. A gas generator like this has made it possible to obtain gaseous nitrogen at a temperature of about 590 K [3]. Generally speaking, a cyclone separator is a device which removes solid particles from a gaseous or liquid stream without using filters."
What is the characteristic shape of the body in which the fluid mixed with solid particles enters during the separation process?," The solid particles are removed because they are denser than the other molecules of the stream. A fluid mixed with solid particles enters tangentially in a cyclone, which consists of a cylindrical body, ac o n i c a lo u t l e tf o rt h ep a r t i c l e s ,a n dat o pa x i a lp i p eo u t l e tf o rt h ec l e a n fl u i d ."
What happens to high-density particles in a conical cyclone influenced by centrifugal force?,"A n outer vortex is created due to the centrifugal force applied to the molecules, and the fluid circles down to the bottom end of the cone. Particles of high density are pushed against the wall and separated from the fluid. In the conical part, the fluid reverses the direction of its motion, goes up via the central part of the cyclone (inner vortex), and exits on the top by the fluid outlet pipe."
What type of gas generator system involves a heating process with solid propellant?," The solid particles travel down the wall, and are collected into a receptacle at the bottom of the conical part. This device is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of the US Government [ 25]. Still another type of solid-propellant gas generator is the helium system with solid-propellant gas generator heating."
What is the primary function of the solid-propellant gas generator in the spherical vessel system?," This system consists of a spherical vessel storing helium at high pressure, a solid-propellant gas generator mounted inside this vessel, a filter, and a pressure regulator, as shown in the following figure. 244 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure This solid-propellant gas generator provides heat, which causes the helium to expand, and also additional pressurising gas."
"What is necessary in the design of liquid-propellant gas generators to prevent issues related to gas compatibility, temperature, and condensable elements?"," This system requires a large vessel to store the solid propellant and the helium at high pressure. 3.7 Control Systems for Liquid-Propellant Gas Generators As has been shown in Sect. 3.6,l i q u i d - p r o p e l l a n tg a sg e n e r a t o r sr e q u i r eac a r e f u l design, in order to avoid problems concerning the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas with the propellants, or the temperature of this gas, or the presence of condensible elements into it."
What gas is considered satisfactory for chemical compatibility when using hydrazine mono-propellant?," These problems can be solved by using control systems, which are described in the present paragraph. As far as the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas is concerned, hydrazine mono-propellant is considered satisfactory in view of the chemical characteristics and the molar masses of the gases (nitrogen and hydrogen) resulting from its decom- position in the presence of a catalyst."
What can be adjusted to ensure the gases from liquid propellants are chemically compatible in a gas generator?," These gases contain no carbon, and therefore generate no deposits which could lower the performance of a heat exchanger. In case of gas generators using a combination of two liquid propellants, the gases generated by them can be made chemically compatible with the propellants by varying the value of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio o/fwith respect to the stoichiometric value."
What propellant combination was utilized in the Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile for its first and second stages?," By so doing, the same combination of propellants can be used to generate a pressurising gas compatible with both the oxidiser and the fuel. An example is given by the hyper- golic combination of nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozine 50, which was used for the first and second stages of the Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile and Titan space 3."
What is the primary function of the gas generator in the Titan engine?,"7 Control Systems for Liquid-Propellant Gas Generators 245 launch vehicles [ 26]. As has been shown in Sect. 3.6,t h eg a sg e n e r a t o ro ft h eT i t a n engine uses the engine propellants to produce fuel-rich exhaust gases which drive the engine turbo-pumps. As far as the temperature of the pressurising gas is concerned, more than one option can be chosen to assure compatibility."
What technique can be used to reduce combustion temperature by changing the ratio of oxidiser to fuel?," One of such options consists in varying of the value of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio to lower the combustion temperature, as has been shown above. Another option consists in injecting a non-reacting liquid into the gas generator, in order to subtract heat from the combusted gas in the evaporation of this liquid."
What is required for the liquid propellant to safely absorb heat from the gas in a heat exchanger?," A third option consists in cooling the gas by means of a heat exchanger, through which the gas flows with one of the liquid propellants. Of course, this option can be chosen only when the propellant can safely absorb the heat coming from the combusted gas. The presence of condensible elements into the combusted gas can be avoided by regulating the combustion temperature, as will be shown below."
What combustion temperature is necessary to ensure low molar mass of the combustion products?," In order for the molar mass of the combusted gas to be low, the combustion temperature of a fuel-rich mixture should reach a value (approximately 811 K) suf ficient to break the bonds of the complex molecules of the combustion products and give rise to substances having low-mass molecules. Of course, this result can be obtained only when the fuel injected in excess into the gas generator does not reduce the combustion temperature below about 811 K."
What issue arises with high molar mass molecules of combusted gas at low temperatures?," This is because, when the temperature is too low, some molecules of the combusted gas have a high molar mass, and these molecules are subject to condense. Some typical control systems used for liquid-propellant gas generators are brie fly described below. One of these control systems uses a single gas generator, which provides gas under pressure to both the fuel tank and the oxidiser tank, with injection cooling."
What are the two types of substances that can be used in the gas feed systems?," A scheme of this system is shown in the following figure. 246 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure The liquid substances employed may be either a mono-propellant and an inert coolant or a combination of two propellants. In the second case, the cooling is obtained by injecting the second propellant in excess with respect to the quantity necessary for the stoichiometric mixture ratio."
What gas is used to maintain pressure in the vessel for the propulsion system?," The mono-propellant and the coolant or the two propellants are kept under pressure by means of gaseous helium stored at a high pressure in a vessel. Downstream of this vessel, the pressure is kept to the desired value by using valves and a pressure regulator. This system makes it possible to cool the gas coming from the gas generator to a temperature compatible with the propellants."
What must be considered alongside temperature when studying a combination of liquid substances?," A combination of liquid substances must be studied carefully, in order to satisfy not only the temperature requirement, but also the other requirements, and in particular the one concerning the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas with both of the propellants. To this regard, fuel-rich gases have been found apt to pressurise storable oxidisers."
What components are utilized in the control system that employs a single gas generator and a heat exchanger?," Examples of such oxidisers are given in [ 3]. Another of these control systems uses a single gas generator and a heat exchanger, as shown in the following scheme, which refers to the case of a gas generator using ac o m b i n a t i o no ft w op r o p e l l a n t s . The hot gas coming from the gas generator is directed to a heat exchanger, in order to transfer heat to the cold helium."
What is the purpose of the gas generated in a double gas generator system?," The helium expands after being heated and is used to pressurise the tank of the main oxidiser. The gas cooled through the gas generator is used to pressurise the tank of the main fuel. 3.7 Control Systems for Liquid-Propellant Gas Generators 247 Still another of these control systems uses a double gas generator, which provides gas under pressure to both the fuel tank and the oxidiser tank, with injection cooling."
What type of gas does the gas generator with excess oxidiser injection produce?," As c h e m eo ft h i ss y s t e mi ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e . In this system, the fuel and the oxidiser are fed to two gas generators by using the pressure exerted by the helium. One of the gas generators operates with injection of excess oxidiser, and produces a cool, oxidiser-rich gas, which is used to pressurise the main oxidiser tank."
"What is the purpose of the cool, fuel-rich gas produced by the other gas generator?"," The other gas generator operates with injection of excess fuel, and produces a cool, fuel-rich gas, which is used to pressurise the main fuel tank. This system requires a balance in the output of the two gas generators and also ap r e s s u r ec o n t r o li nb o t ho ft h em a i np r o p e l l a n tt a n k s ."
What temperature in Kelvin has been achieved in the generated gas during operation?,"B ys od o i n g ,t e m p e r a t u r e sa s low as 589 K have been reached in the gas generated [ 3]. 3.8 Feed Systems Using Direct Injection into the Main Propellant Tanks In these systems, a small quantity of oxidiser is injected directly into the main tank containing the fuel, and a small quantity of fuel is injected directly into the main tank containing the oxidiser."
What types of direct injection systems are illustrated in the provided figure?," An hypergolic reaction, which takes place between the oxidiser and the fuel, produces gases used to pressurise the oxidiser and the fuel into 248 3 Feed Systems Using Gases Under Pressure their respective main tanks. Two versions (parallel and serial) of the direct injection system are shown in the following figure."
What are the components in the system that manage the storage and injection of propellants?," The parallel version (left) of the system consists of a small vessel containing helium stored at high pressure, a helium pressure regulator, two small auxiliary propellant tanks (one for the fuel and the other for the oxidiser), and two main propellant tanks. The fuel is directly injected from its auxiliary tank into the main tank containing the oxidiser, and the oxidiser is directly injected from its auxiliary tank into the main tank containing the fuel."
What components are included in the serial version of the system for propellant storage and management?," The serial version (right) of the system consists of a small vessel containing helium stored at high pressure, a helium pressure regulator, only one small auxiliary propellant tank containing one of the two propellants, two main propellant tanks, and a regulator of the difference of pressure between the two main propellant tanks."
What is the function of the regulator in the serial version regarding the fuel and oxidiser interaction?," The serial version takes advantage of the possibility of exerting a lower pressure in one of the two main propellant tanks than in the other. In the scheme shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure, a small quantity of the fuel contained in its main tank passes through a regulator and is injected into the main tank containing the oxidiser."
What are the four criteria suggested by Huzel and Huang for selecting a gas feed system?, 3.9 Choice of a Feed System Using Gases Under Pressure The choice of one of another system which uses gases stored under pressure is usually the result of a preliminary study. Huzel and Huang [ 3]h a v es u g g e s t e df o u rc r i t e r i a to be considered in this study. They are: •mission requirements for the rocket vehicle; •chemical compatibility of the propellants with the materials; 3.
What are the mission requirements related to engine operation and pressure control in the feed system?,"9 Choice of a Feed System Using Gases Under Pressure 249 •system reliability; and •system performance. The mission requirements concern the possibility of using storable propellants, the need to start the engine one or more times, and the capability of controlling the values of pressure in the ullage space."
What factors are essential for ensuring that propellants do not react with their container materials?," The chemical compatibility of the propellants with the materials concern the absence of reactivity between the propellants and the materials of which their containers are made, the absence of condensible or soluble particles in the combusted gas, and the maintenance of a desired value of temperature in the gas under pressure."
Which types of components typically require more development effort to achieve high reliability?," The system reliability depends on the degree of complexity of the system, on the number of its failure modes, and on the number of its components. The reliability of each component, in turn, is to be evaluated considering its time of development and the funds available. To this regard, components expected to require greater efforts of development to reach desirable degrees of reliability are gas generators, heat exchangers forming an integral part of the thrust chamber, storage vessels subject to high pressures, and pipes and regulators for gases at high temperatures."
How does the gross mass of stored gas influence the performance of a pressurisation system?," The system performance depends on the gross mass of the gas stored for pressuri- sation, which in turn depends on its molar mass and also on the mass of the system of pressurisation. The latter mass is part of the mass of the rocket vehicle at burnout. References 1. Greene WD (2013) Inside the LEO doghouse, start me up! NASA, 19 Dec 2013."

What defines a dynamical system in the context of control systems?,Chapter 5 Control Systems and Valves 5.1 Fundamental Concepts on Control Systems The engine of a rocket vehicle is a particular case of a dynamical system. By system we mean a collection of parts or elements or components which work together to attain an object. By dynamical system we mean a system whose behaviour changes with time in response to an external stimulus or force.
What are the main components of a rocket vehicle engine system that facilitate thrust generation?," In case of an engine of a rocket vehicle, the object of the system is the generation of a thrust vector having the desired magnitude and direction.

"What type of dynamical systems do rocket vehicles belong to, based on the dependency of their mission success on component outputs?"," In case of a rocket vehicle, the success or the failure of the mission of the vehicle depends on the outputs of the various components or subsystems of which the system is made. Therefore, a rocket vehicle belongs to a particular class of dynamical systems, which are called controlled systems. Controlled systems exist in several fields of engineering."
What does managing a dynamical system aim to achieve in terms of its behavior and performance?," Controlling a dynamical system means regulating, or commanding, or governing that system in order to reach ©T h eE d i t o r ( s )( i fa p p l i c a b l e )a n dT h eA u t h o r ( s ) ,u n d e re x c l u s i v el i c e n s e to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines , Springer Aerospace Technology, https://doi."

What type of system is described where the first component influences the second without being influenced back?," An open-loop system is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 1], which illustrates two systems which are connected between them, because the output signals uof the first (controller) are also the input signals of the second, which is the controlled system. Therefore, the first system controls the second system, but is not controlled by it."
What type of control system allows its output signal to have no effect on its input?," There is no mutual control of one system over the other. In other words, a system whose output signal yhas no effect upon the input to the control process is called an open-loop control system.

In other words, a closed-loop control system is a control system in which some function of the output yof some part of the system is fed back as a secondary input which adds to the primary input rto the system, so as to affect the response of the system itself."
What components are involved in supplying propellants to the combustion chamber in a pressure-fed rocket engine?," As an example of a control system for a rocket vehicle, Lorenzo and Musgrave [ 2]d e s c r i b eap r e s s u r e - f e db i - p r o p e l l a n te n g i n e ,i nw h i c ht h ep r o p e l - lants are kept under pressure in their respective tanks and then supplied to the main combustion chamber through appropriate feed lines, control valves, and injector elements, as has been shown in Chap."

How does the control system adjust the thrust in the rocket engine?," The control system of this rocket engine regulates the thrust by controlling the pressure pcof the gas in the combustion chamber and the mixture ratio o/fof the two propellants, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 2]. 5.1 Fundamental Concepts on Control Systems 449 The preceding scheme has two control loops."
What is the role of the fast loop in maintaining the combustion chamber's temperature?," One of them controls the mixture ratio o/fof the propellants, and the other controls the pressure pcof the gas in the combustion chamber. The first loop operates usually, but not necessarily, on the propellant supplied at higher mass flow rate than the other. This loop is tuned to be the fast loop. This reduces excursions in the mixture ratio away from the set point, which in turn keeps the temperatures of the gas and of the metal at the design conditions."
What measurements are necessary for controlling the valve areas in the slow loop?," The second loop, which controls the pressure of the gas in the combustion chamber, is the slow loop, and its bandwidth is set by thrust response requirements. The type of control shown above requires three measurements ( pc, . moand . mf)a n dt w oc o n t r o l inputs for the valve areas AoandAf[2]."
What devices are used to manage pressure drops in the open-loop control system of a rocket engine?," An open-loop control system for a rocket engine is calibrated to a fixed set of conditions, and uses ori fices and on-off command devices to correct deviations of some parameters from their design values. For example, ori fices of proper size are inserted into the flow lines to command pressure drops, and the mass flow rates of the propellants are controlled by opening or closing valves."
What type of system uses sensors and computers to detect discrepancies between a reference signal and the output for corrections?," An open-loop control system is simple, but is also limited to a speci fic set of parameters, and cannot compensate for variable conditions. The sequence times in an open-loop control system are often established by means of interlocks. 450 5 Control Systems and Valves Ac l o s e d - l o o pc o n t r o ls y s t e mu s e ss e n s o r s ,c o m p u t e r st od e t e c te r r o r s( w h i c ha r e differences between a given reference signal rand the output yof the system), and actuation commands ugenerated by the computers to correct the errors."
What components are essential for a closed-loop control system to identify and rectify errors?," Therefore, a closed-loop control system does not require calibration for a speci fic set of conditions. It requires sensors and computers to detect errors and take appropriate steps to correct them. A closed-loop control system is often used in a rocket engine to control the mixture ratio o/fof the propellants, and the thrust vector Fin magnitude and direction."
What describes the actuation command u in closed-loop control when the control error e is positive or negative?," Ac l o s e d - l o o pc o n t r o ls y s t e mi nar o c k e te n g i n em a yo p e r a t ei no n eo ft h em o d e s indicated below.

What value is assigned to the actuation command u when the control error e is zero?," The preceding equation does not de fine a value of the actuation command uwhen the control error eis equal to zero. In practice, uis taken equal to zero ( u=0) when the control error eis in a narrow band centred around e=0. The on-off control is used for a rocket engine, for example, when a pressure switch opens or closes av a l v ew h i c hr e g u l a t e st h ep r e s s u r ei nat a n k ."
What defines the interval within which the controller behaves linearly in PID control?," (2) Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, which can be described as follows: u=⎧ ⎨ ⎩umaxife≥emax kpeifemin<e<emax uminife≤emin where kpis the controller gain, emin=umin/kp,a n d emax=umax/kp.

What control strategy achieves zero steady-state error by incorporating a specific gain related to accumulating past errors?,"1 Fundamental Concepts on Control Systems 451 where kiis the integral gain. This type of control is called integral control. A controller with integral control has zero steady-state error [ 1]. Unfortunately, there may not always be a steady state, because the system may be subject to oscillations.

What are the three terms used in the proportional-integral-derivative control for a rocket engine?," The proportional-integral-derivative control is used for a rocket engine in several cases, for example, to control the pressure in the combustion chamber (proportional term), or the mixture ratio of the propellants (integral term), or the direction of the thrust vector with phase lead (derivative term)."
What is the role of the valve in the closed-loop control system of the rocket engine?," An example of a closed-loop control system for a rocket engine has been given by Huzel and Huang [ 3]b ym e a n so ft h e following scheme, re-drawn from [ 3]. This control system illustrated above has the purpose of maintaining the value pc of the pressure in the combustion chamber equal to a desired value prof reference, by using a valve which controls the value ."
What components are involved in the control system regulating mass flow rate in the gas generator?," mgof the mass flow rate in the gas generator (GG). The magnitude Fof the thrust vector is controlled indirectly, by regulating the pressure pcin the combustion chamber. 452 5 Control Systems and Valves This control system consists of a sensor (chamber pressure transducer), a computer containing an electric summing junction and an electric ampli fier, and a controller (gas generator flow control valve) which regulates the value of the mass flow rate ."

The computer compares the reference input signal rwith the input signal ycoming from the sensor (chamber pressure transducer). The signal ris related to the reference pressure pr,a n dt h es i g n a l yis related to the actual pressure pcin the combustion chamber through differential equations, which describe the behaviour of the components of the system."
What symbolic representation defines the relationship between the input and output components in the control system described?," The letters A,B,C,a n d Din the preceding figure indicate the relations existing between the input and the output of the respective components. The equations which govern this control systems can be written symbolically as follows r=Apr e=r - y . mg=Be pc=C . mg y=Dpc The behaviour of this control system results from the solution of the preceding equations."
What method is commonly used to solve equations in control systems to avoid instability and large oscillations?," These equations are usually solved by using the method of the Laplace transformation (see, for example, [ 4]). The values to be given to the gains and to the response lags of a control system are to be chosen carefully, sometimes by trial and error, in order not to introduce overshoots or other causes of instability, which could give rise to large oscillations."
What tasks do control systems manage in liquid-propellant rocket engines during operation?," 5.2 Control Systems for Rocket Engines The control systems described in general terms in the preceding section are used in liquid-propellant rocket engines to perform some or all of the following tasks: •engine start; •engine shutdown; •engine restart, in case of engines having restart capability; •execution of a given plan of operation; •change of the given plan of operation, or even engine shutdown, in the presence of a malfunction; •propellant tank filling up; 5."
What processes are involved in preparing cryogenic propellants and ensuring engine readiness for flight?,"2 Control Systems for Rocket Engines 453 •draining excess of propellants after filling; •in case of cryogenic propellants, chilling pipes, pumps, cooling jackets, injectors, and valves by bleeding the cold propellants through them; •check-out the proper operation of critical components before flight; and •in case of recoverable and reusable engines, recycling and refurbishing the engines to put them in conditions of readiness for a new use."
What components are commonly identified as actuators in liquid-propellant rocket engines?," In the speci fic case of liquid-propellant rocket engines, most of the actuators used for control functions are valves, regulators, pressure switches, and flow controls. Special computers for automatic control in large engines are also commonly used [5]. In addition, safety controls are used to protect personnel and equipment in case of malfunctions, and check-out controls make it possible to test the operation of critical components of a rocket engine without actually firing the engine."
What are the initial steps in the sequence that prepares a rocket engine for full operation?," The start sequence of a rocket engine has the purpose of controlling the engine from the moment in which the start signal is given to the full operation of the main stage. This sequence includes the steps of preparation (thrust chamber purging and chill-down of propellant transfer lines), application of start energy (start tanks and turbine spinner), and introduction followed by ignition of the propellants in the main combustion chamber."
What factors influence whether a start sequence will be oxidiser-lead or fuel-lead?," Secondary start sequences may be needed for some subsystems, as is the case with a gas generator or a pre-burner. A start sequence is regulated by means of interlocks, and by monitoring each step of the sequence. The opening sequence of the propellant valves may perform either an oxidiser-lead or a fuel-lead start, depending on the combination of propellants chosen, on the method used to ignite the propellants, and on the method used to cool the thrust chamber."
What is the typical range of start delay time for small thrusters fed by gas under pressure?," The start delay time is the time necessary to purge the engine, open the valves, initiate the combustion, and increase the pressure in the combustion chamber to the rated value. This time is usually small (from 0.003 to 0.015 s in small thrusters) for an engine fed by gas under pressure, in which the pressurisation system has to be activated and the ullage volume has to be put under pressure before the start."
What additional processes are needed for starting an engine fed by turbo-pumps compared to a pressure-fed engine?," An engine fed by turbo-pumps requires more time to start (from 1 to 5 s), because it is necessary not only to execute the operations indicated above for a pressure-fed engine, but also to start a gas generator or a pre-burner, and to increase the speed of the turbo-pumps to a level in which the combustion can be firstly self-sustained and then brought to its full extent."
What factor extends the time required for igniter function in non-hypergolic rocket engine propellant combinations?," When the combination of propellants used in a rocket engine is not hypergolic, additional time is necessary for the igniter to work and for the control function to con firm the proper operation of the igniter. The ignition methods used for liquid-propellant rocket engines have been discussed in Chap."
What actions are included in the shutdown sequence during test firings for safety?," 2, Sects. 2.7and 2.8. The shutdown sequence is executed either in normal operating conditions or in cases of emergency. This is done by shutting off the flow to the gas generator (or to the pre-burner) and to the main combustion chamber. In case of test firings, the shutdown sequence also includes purges and flushes for post- firing safety."
What is the purpose of the control system in relation to the valve operation during combustion?, The control system regulates the valve closing sequence in such a way as to provide a fuel-rich cut-off in the main combustion chamber. This prevents high picks of temperature and 454 5 Control Systems and Valves results in a smooth and rapid termination of the thrust. The valves close in a fixed sequence.
What happens to the propellant pressures and mass flow rates after the valve closes?," The valve controlling the gas generator or the pre-burner closes first. The pressurisation in the propellant tanks is stopped. The pumps slow down, as a result of the decrease in the gas flow through the turbine. The pressures and the mass flow rates of the propellants decrease quickly and reduce to zero."
What components regulate the operational phases of the RS-25 engines in the Space Shuttle?," In the three main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, the characteristics of start, run, and shutdown are established by the combined actions of the main fuel valve, the main oxidiser valve, the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve, the fuel pre- burner oxidiser valve, and the chamber coolant valve."
What component sends positioning signals to the hydraulic actuators controlling the valves in the RS-25 engine?," These valves are powered by hydraulic actuators which receive positioning signals from the engine controller, which in turn uses performance data gathered by sensors located throughout the engine. A functional scheme showing the propellant flow through the RS-25 engine and the valves named above is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Wikimedia [ 6]."
What operational states do the main oxidiser valve and main fuel valve maintain during the engine run phase?," With reference to the preceding figure, the main oxidiser valve, the main fuel valve, and the chamber coolant valve are switched to run schedules during the engine run phase, while the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve and the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve are switched to closed-loop operations. The run schedule for the main oxidiser valve and for the main fuel valve cause them to simply remain fully open, whereas the run schedule for the chamber coolant valve drives it between half open at 67% thrust (minimum power level) and fully open at 100% thrust and above (in the Space Shuttle main engine, the thrust is variable between the minimum power level or 67% to the full power level or 109%, the rated or 100% value being 2."
What relationships does the control system maintain among the parallel paths as the turbo-pump output pressure changes?,"094 ×106 Ni nv a c u oa n d1 . 6 6 7 ×106Na ts e al e v e l ) .T h i sa c t i o nm a i n t a i n st h ea p p r o p r i a t e 5.2 Control Systems for Rocket Engines 455 flow relationships among the several parallel fuel flow paths, as the high-pressure fuel turbo-pump output pressure varies with thrust."
What role do the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve and the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve play in engine operation?," During engine run, the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve and the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve are used as control devices for thrust and mixture ratio. Manipulating the valves affects the output of the pre-burners, the speed of the turbo-pumps, and therefore the propellant flow rates. The fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve is driven alone to maintain mixture ratio in the main combustion chamber, while the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve is driven with the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve to increase or decrease thrust while maintaining the mixture ratio."
What components are involved in the control loops for managing flow rates and pressure in a combustion chamber?," The control loops include the controller, the valve actuators, and the transducers which sense the flow rates and the pressure in the main combustion chamber, and therefore the thrust. During the engine shutdown phase, all five valves are switched to shutdown schedules. These schedules ensure a smooth and safe shutdown by establishing a fuel lag."
What environmental condition is created during the shutdown phase due to the oxidiser leaving the combustion chambers before the fuel?," In other words, the oxidiser leaves the combustion chambers ahead of the fuel. This lag creates a fuel-rich and cool shutdown environment [ 7]. The controller of the RS-25 engine provides complete and continuous moni- toring and control of engine operation. In addition, it performs maintenance and start preparation checks, and collects data for historical and maintenance purposes."
What are the five main components included in the RS-25 engine controller?," The controller of the RS-25 engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 7]. The controller is an electronic package which contains five principal sections: •power supply section; •input electronics section; •output electronics section; •computer interface section; and •digital computer unit."
What operational modes does the dual-redundant controller possess?," Pressure, temperature, pump speed, flow rate, and position sensors supply the input signals. Output signals operate spark igniters, solenoid valves, and hydraulic 456 5 Control Systems and Valves actuators. The controller is dual-redundant, which gives it normal, fail-operate, and fail-safe operational mode capability."
What happens to engine control parameters during the fail-safe mode after a second failure?," Fail-operate mode follows a first failure, and is similar to normal mode, but with a loss of some redundancy. Fail-safe mode follows a second failure. In this mode, engine throttling and mixture ratio control are suspended, the main propellant valves are held fixed in their last commanded position, and the engine is subsequently shutdown pneumatically."
How does the controller maintain engine thrust and mixture ratio in the combustion chamber?," The controller provides active and continuous control of the engine thrust and of the mixture ratio in the main combustion chamber through closed-loop control. The controller reads the pressure (equivalent to the thrust) in the main combustion chamber, and compares it to the existing thrust reference signal."
What mixture ratio is maintained in the main combustion chamber according to the control system described?," It uses the error to drive the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve, which adjusts the thrust and eliminates the error. For the mixture ratio in the main combustion chamber, the controller reads the fuel flow-meter and drives the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve to adjust the fuel flowing to the main combustion chamber, thus maintaining a mixture ratio o/f=6."
What are the additional responsibilities of the controller aside from its primary functions?," In addition to these primary functions, the controller performs engine checkout, limit monitoring, start readiness veri fication, and engine start and shutdown sequencing. The controller instructions to the engine control elements are updated 50 times per second (every 20 ms). The electronics are mounted on modular boards inside a sealed and pressurised chassis, which is cooled by heat convection through pin fins [ 7]."
How can the thrust of a rocket engine be adjusted during the final phase of its flight?," 5.3 Control of Thrust Magnitude The thrust of a rocket engine is controlled in magnitude by regulating the pressure in the main combustion chamber. Sometimes, a reduction of the thrust magnitude, also known as throttling, is necessary in the last part of the propelled flight of a rocket vehicle. This reduction can be performed by decreasing, either stepwise or continuously, the pressure in the main combustion chamber."
What effect does regulating the mass flow rate of propellants through the gas generator have on the combustion chamber's pressure and propellant mixture ratio?," In case of rocket engines fed by turbo-pumps, the pressure in the main combustion chamber can be reduced by regulating either the mass flow rate of the propellants through the gas generator or the mass flow rate of the hot gas through the turbine. When the first method is used, it is also possible to vary the mixture ratio of the propellants."
How can thrust be adjusted in a cluster of rocket engines?," In case of rocket engines fed by gases under pressure, the pressure in the combus- tion chamber can be reduced by regulating the pressures in the main tanks of the propellants. In case of multiple engines arranged in a cluster, thrust control can be performed by shutting off one or more engines of the cluster."
What method is used to control thrust in turbo-pump fed rocket engines according to the provided information?," The examples of thrust regulation considered in Sect. 5.1concern the case of a rocket engine fed by gases under pressure and the case of a rocket engine fed by turbo-pumps. In the second case, the thrust has been controlled in magnitude by using a valve regulating the value of the mass flow rate in the gas generator, and therefore the power delivered by the turbine."
What component in the closed-loop control system regulates the flow of propellants toward the combustion chamber?," 5.3 Control of Thrust Magnitude 457 The example given below concerns thrust regulation performed by varying the flow of the propellants. The following, figure, re-drawn from [ 3], illustrates the scheme of a closed-loop control system based on flow variation. In the present case, the regulation is based on two valves which determine the resistances encountered by the two different propellants in their respective lines towards the combustion chamber."
What role does the output from the pressure transducer play in the thrust throttle control system?," A chamber pressure transducer senses the pressure pcin the combustion chamber, which is used as an indicator of the thrust magnitude. The output signal yof the chamber pressure transducer is fed back as a secondary input to the thrust throttle control computer, which compares the signal ywith its primary input, which is the reference signal r."
How does the RS-25 engine achieve throttling of the propellants?,"T h ee r r o r e=r - yis used to drive the thrust throttle control actuator, which in turn regulates the control valves of the propellants in such a way as to reduce the error. In the RS-25 engine, throttling is accomplished by varying the output of the pre- burners, thus varying the speed of the high-pressure turbo-pumps, and therefore the mass flow rates of the propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen)."
What effect does restricting oxidiser flow to the pre-burners have on the turbine inlet temperature?," The mixture ratio of the propellants in the main combustion chamber is o/f=6.032. This value is maintained by varying the fuel flow rate around the oxidiser flow rate [ 7]. In other words, restricting the oxidiser flow to the pre-burners causes the turbine inlet temperature to decrease. 458 5 Control Systems and Valves 5."
What methods can be used to enhance control of the propellant mixture ratio in rocket engines?,"4 Control of Propellant Mixture Ratio An open-loop control system of the mixture ratio of the propellants in a rocket engine can be obtained by installing calibration ori fices of proper size in the propellant lines. Further re finements are possible by weighing accurately the propellants loaded in the tanks, by using ori fices of adjustable (rather than fixed) size in case of storable fluids, in order to regulate the size of the ori fices just before take-off, and by installing valves at the pump inlet of engines fed by turbo-pumps, in order to compensate for effects induced by accelerations acting on the fluid mass."
How does the closed-loop control system respond to changes in fluid pressure due to variable accelerations?," In the last manner, an increase or decrease in pressure in the fluids due to variable accelerations is sensed and fed back to a closed-loop control system, which regulates gradually the valves and also protects the pumps. In certain cases, it is necessary to perform a continuous control of the mixture ratio by using a closed-loop system."
What is the function of the two flow-meters in the control system described?," In such cases, Huzel and Huang [ 3]s u g g e s tt h e control scheme shown in the following figure. The control system illustrated in the preceding figure has two flow-meters which sense continuously the mass flow rates . moand . mfof the propellants.

What type of flow-meter indicates the volume flow rate of a fluid stream passing through a specific cross-sectional area?," moof the oxidiser, in such a way as to correct the error. A fl o w - m e t e ri sad e v i c ew h i c hm e a s u r e se i t h e rt h ev o l u m e fl o wr a t e q(m3/s) or the mass flow rate . m(kg/s)of a fluid which passes through it.

How is the mass flow rate calculated when the volume flow rate is known?," A velocity flow meter (such as a magnetic, turbine, ultrasonic, and 5.4 Control of Propellant Mixture Ratio 459 vortex shedding and fluidic flow-meter) measures the velocity vof a fluid stream to determine the volume flow rate q. When the volume flow rate qis known, the mass flow rate . mresults from ."
What is the relationship between the frequency of the output signal and the angular velocity of the rotor in a turbine-type flow meter?," m= rho q,w h e r e rho (kg/m3)i st h ed e n s i t yo ft h e fl u i di nt h e given conditions.

What generates an electrical cycle in the flow-meter system described?," As shown in the preceding figure, the fluid passing through the flow-meter impinges on the blades of a turbine, which are free to rotate about an axis along the central line of the turbine housing. A permanent magnet placed within the windings of a pickoff coil generates a magnetic field. An electrical cycle is generated by each blade which sweeps through the magnetic field present in the fluid passage."
What type of control is used to manage the amount of propellant left in tanks?," Another flow-meter, based on the Venturi tube, will be described in Sect. 5.7. Further information on several types of flow-meters can be found in [ 9]. 5.5 Control of Propellant Consumption This type of control is performed by sensors which measure the amount of propellant remaining in the tanks and the unbalance of one of the two propellants with respect to the other."
What components are involved in measuring the residual masses of the two propellants in the closed-loop scheme?," A closed-loop scheme indicated by Huzel and Huang [ 3]i ss h o w ni n the following figure. 460 5 Control Systems and Valves This control system measures continuously the residual masses mfandmoof the two propellants by using sensors placed in the respective tanks. The transducer output signals yfandyocorresponding to these masses are summed, and the signal resulting from the sum yf+yois compared with a propellant use control reference signal rwhich is fed to the propellant use control computer."
What is the purpose of the error signal in relation to the command mixture ratio signal?, The error signal e=r - (yf+yo)i sa m p l i fi e da n dt h e nu s e dt om o d i f yt h e command reference mixture ratio signal⎦parenleftbig . mo/ . mf⎦parenrightbig rwhich is fed to the mixture ratio control computer.

What components form the basis of most sensors that detect fluid presence in a tank?," A brief account is given below. Sensors detecting the presence of fluids of a given type at given locations in a tank are usually called wet-dry sensors. Most wet-dry sensors are based on a hot wire or an electrical resistance or an electrical impedance element which carries a small current. The presence of a given type of fluid at the sensor location is detected by a change in the electrical impedance of the sensor, which in turn depends on the type of fluid (gas or liquid) around the sensor."
"How does sensor impedance vary with heat transfer in different mediums, specifically between liquid and gas environments?"," This is because the sensor impedance depends on the amount of heat transfer from the sensor to the surrounding medium, due to the heating caused by the passage of the electric current. The heat transfer is greater when the sensor is surrounded by a liquid. Thus, by measuring a change in current for a constant applied voltage or a change in voltage for a constant applied current, it is possible to detect whether the sensor is in a liquid or in a gas."
What occurs to the light from the sensor when it is submerged in a gas?," Another type of sensor is based on a laser light source incorporated in a prism-like capsule, whose index of refraction is matched to the index of refraction of the liquid contained in a tank. A scheme of this optical sensor is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 10]. 5.5 Control of Propellant Consumption 461 When the sensor is immersed in a gas, as shown on the left-hand side of the preceding figure, the light is re flected off the end of the prism back to a photocell at the light source."
What indicates the state of dryness or wetness of the sensor in relation to light transmission?," By contrast, when the sensor is immersed in a liquid, as shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure, the light is transmitted through the liquid without re flection off the prism. Thus, the presence or absence of a re flection indicates whether the sensor is dry or wet. Sensors which detect the location of the surface of a liquid in a tank or the depth of this liquid above the sensor are called level sensors."
What type of conditions limit the usage of pressure sensors in measurement applications?," In this category are pressure sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and electrical capacity sensors. Pressure sensors cannot be used in weightless conditions, because they measure the pressure head p/( rho g0)o ft h el i q u i dp l a c e da b o v et h el o c a t i o no ft h es e n s o r .A pressure transducer is inserted at the bottom of a gauge line going from the bottom to the top of a tank."
How does the pressure difference between gas and liquid relate to the liquid's depth in a tank?, A pressure sensor detects the difference of pressure existing between the gas at the top and the liquid at the bottom of the tank. This difference is related to the depth of the liquid when the pressure and the temperature of the substance (liquid or gas) are known. Ultrasonic sensors generate an ultrasonic pulse which is transmitted through the liquid propellant contained in a tank.
How is the elapsed time between pulse emission and echo reception related to the depth of liquid above the transducer?," A mismatch of acoustic impedance at the liquid- gas interface generates an echo, which is transmitted back through the liquid to an ultrasonic receiver at the transducer location. The time elapsed between the emission of the pulse and the reception of the echo is related to the depth of liquid above the transducer by the sonic velocity in the liquid."
What influences the speed of a torsional wave in an ultrasonic sensor's wave guide?," A sensor of this type can be used in low- gravity conditions, but the liquid must be maintained in a known con figuration above the sensor by a propellant management device based on the principle of capillarity. An ultrasonic sensor of another type is a torsional wave guide. In this sensor, the speed of a torsional wave propagating along a wave guide, such as a rod, depends on whether the wave guide is immersed in a liquid or in a gas."
How does zero gravity affect the performance of the sensor relating to liquid adherence on the wave guide?," The impedance mismatch at the liquid-gas interface generates an echo, which is detected to provide information on the length of the wave guide which is immersed in the liquid. However, some tests executed in conditions of zero gravity have shown that the adherence of liquid to portions of the wave guide supposed to be dry degraded seriously the accuracy of the sensor."
What is the configuration of the sensing probe mentioned in the passage?," Ac a p a c i t ys e n s o rc o n t a i n e di nap r o p e l l a n tt a n ki ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e , due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11]. 462 5 Control Systems and Valves Ac a p a c i t yp r o b es e n s e sm a s sd i r e c t l y .T h es e n s i n gp r o b ec o n s i s t se s s e n t i a l l yo f two coaxial tubes contained in a tank."
What changes the capacity of the electric condenser in the described tubes?," These tubes, when a voltage is applied to them, act as the plates of an electric condenser, whose capacity changes when the proportion between liquid and gas changes. This is because the liquid and the gas contained in the tank have different values of dielectric constant. In other words, the dielectric medium between the two tubes of the probe is the propellant, in liquid and gaseous state, contained in the tank."
How does the liquid level affect the electrical capacity of the probe?," The total electrical capacity of the probe depends on the level of the liquid which fills it. Thus, the measured electrical capacity of the probe provides information on the mass of liquid in the tank. With a suitable electronic apparatus, the mass of the residual propellant in the tank can be measured continuously."
What type of capacity probe was selected for the Centaur launch vehicle?," The outer tube of the capacity probe may be perforated or not, as shown in the preceding figure. A non-perforated probe was chosen for the Centaur launch vehicle, because it provided a better measurement [ 11]. Ap r o p e l l a n tm a n a g e m e n ts y s t e mu s i n ge l e c t r i c a lc a p a c i t yp r o b e sw a sa l s oc h o s e n for the J-2 engine in the S-IVB stage, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 12]."
What components work together to manage propellant loading and engine mixture in the S-IVB stage?," 5.5 Control of Propellant Consumption 463 In the S-IVB stage, the propellant management system, in conjunction with the switch selector, controls the mass propellant loading ratio and the engine mixture ratio (liquid oxygen to liquid hydrogen) to ensure balanced consumption of propellant. The electrical capacity probes, located in the two tanks, monitor the mass of the propellants."
How is the propellant mixture ratio regulated during flight?," During flight, the electrical capacity probes are not used to control the propellant mixture ratio. The mixture ratio is controlled by switch selector outputs, which are used to operate the propellant utilisation (PU) valve. The PU valve is a rotary valve which controls the quantity of liquid oxygen flowing to the engine."
What engine mixture ratio is set before the engine starts?," The PU valve is commanded to its null position to obtain an engine mixture ratio (EMR) of 5.0:1 prior to engine start. The PU valve remains at the 5.0:1 position during the first burn. Prior to engine restart ( first opportunity), the PU valve is commanded by the switch selector to an EMR of 4.5:1 and remain at this position until approximately 464 5 Control Systems and Valves 2m i no fS - I V Bb u r n ."
What happens to the engine mixture ratio if the S-IVB restart is postponed to the second opportunity?,"T h e nt h eP Uv a l v ei sc o m m a n d e dt oi t sn u l lp o s i t i o n( 5 . 0 : 1 )b y the switch selector. However, if the S-IVB restart is delayed to the second opportunity, the EMR is shifted from 4.5:1 to 5.0:1 by the switch selector at about the time in which the engine reaches 90% thrust [ 12]."
Under what conditions can an electrical capacity probe be utilized for measurement in low-gravity environments?," An electrical capacity probe depends on the liquid being settled, and therefore can only be used for gauging during periods of thrusting [ 10]. In principle, an electrical capacity probe might be used in low-gravity conditions if the liquid con figuration is controlled by propellant management devices."
How do capillary forces in the probe's annular gap affect liquid level readings in tanks?," However, in such conditions, capillary forces in the annular gap between the walls of the probe would cause the liquid meniscus location to differ from the liquid level in the tank, and thus cause an inaccurate reading, which may be small and could be compensated for. Depending on the design, the probe can also be sensitive to liquid motions such as occurred with the first landing of the Lunar Module on the Moon, for which non-linear sloshing lowered the effective level of the liquid within the gauge to the point that a premature low liquid level warning was given [ 10]."
What is the term used for estimating the remaining propellant in a tank based on the initial quantity and amount consumed?," In the absence of a speci fic measurement system, the quantity of propellant remaining in a tank can be estimated by determining the consumption of the propel- lants which have already been used in comparison with the quantity initially loaded in the tanks. This method is commonly called bookkeeping."
What types of meters are used to measure propellant flow rates in the system?," Some sensors and devices are used in the bookkeeping method, either separately or in conjunction. They are: • flow-meters or Venturi-meters in the lines between the tanks and the main combustion chamber or the gas generator to measure the flow rates of the propellants; •sensors which determine the flow rates of the propellants by measuring their pressures in the pumps in conjunction with the performance curves of the pumps; and •calibrations of engine thrust versus propellant flow rate and tank pressure."
What factors limit the accuracy of the bookkeeping method for propellant consumption?," Various types of flow-meters, turbine-meters, accelerometers, and pressure sensors are required for the bookkeeping method. This method can only be used during periods of engine thrusting, and its accuracy is limited by the accumula- tion over time of the errors committed in estimating the propellant consumption, in particular near the point of propellant depletion."
What methods can be used to evaluate propellant consumption apart from bookkeeping?," In addition, the bookkeeping method cannot detect leaks. Other methods indicated by Dodge [ 10]t oe v a l u a t ep r o p e l l a n tc o n s u m p t i o na r e : •measuring the acceleration of the vehicle and the thrust of the engine, in order to determine the mass of the vehicle at any given time in comparison with the mass of the empty vehicle; and •measuring the decay of pressure in the ullage spaces, in case of tanks which are initially pressurised, as the liquids are drained from their tanks and the ullage spaces increase."
What mechanism is used to adjust the thrust vector direction in a rocket vehicle?," 5.6 Control of Thrust Direction 465 5.6 Control of Thrust Direction Several methods used to control the direction of the thrust vector in a rocket vehicle have been discussed in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.2,a sf a ra st h e yc a na f f e c tt h ed e s i g no ft h e thrust chamber of a rocket engine. The present section is meant to describe in further depth the method of controlling the thrust vector by using a gimbal mechanism acting on either the nozzle or the engine assembly."
What example of a closed-loop control system utilizing hydraulic actuators for thrust vector management is mentioned?," This method is the most used in liquid- propellant rocket engines, due to its reliability and performance. The following figure, re-drawn from [ 3], shows a control scheme for thrust vector control using hydraulic actuators. An example of a closed-loop control system using hydraulic actuators for thrust vector control is provided by the S-II, which is the second stage of the Saturn V rocket vehicle."
What pattern do the five J-2 engines form in the S-II control system?," A functional scheme of the control system of the S-II is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 12]. 466 5 Control Systems and Valves With reference to the preceding figure, the S-II has five J-2 engines arranged in a quincunx pattern (that is, one at the barycentre and four at the vertices of a square)."
What mechanism is utilized for thrust vector control during powered flight in the S-II stage's outboard engines?," The four outboard engines (No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the figure) are gimbal-mounted to provide thrust vector control during powered flight. Attitude control of the S- II stage is maintained by gimballing the four outboard engines in conjunction with electrical control signals from the inertial unit flight control computer."
What are the main components of each closed-loop hydraulic control subsystem in the gimballing system?," The gimballing system consists of four independent closed-loop hydraulic control subsystems, which provide power for engine gimballing. The primary components of each control subsystem, also shown in the preceding figure, are an auxiliary pump, a main pump, an accumulator/reservoir manifold 5.6 Control of Thrust Direction 467 assembly, and two servo-actuators."
What drives the main pump in the described system?," The auxiliary pump is electrically driven from the ground support equipment to provide hydraulic fluid circulation prior to launch. The main pump is mounted to and driven by the engine liquid-oxygen turbo-pump. The accumulator/reservoir manifold assembly consists of a high-pressure accumu- lator, which receives high-pressure fluid from the pump, and a low-pressure reservoir, which receives return fluid from the servo-actuators."
What role does the auxiliary pump play during the pre-launch period?," The servo-actuator is a power control unit, which converts electrical signals and hydraulic power into mechanical outputs which gimbal the engine. The components indicated in the preceding func- tional scheme are also shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [13]. During the pre-launch period, the auxiliary pump circulates the hydraulic fluid to preclude fluid freezing during propellant loading."
What function does the accumulator serve during the transition between the first and second stages?," Circulation is not required during the first stage (S-IC) burn, due to the short duration of the burn. After separation of the second stage (S-II) from the first, a S-II switch selector command unlocks the accumulator lock-up valves, releasing high-pressure fluid to each of the servo- actuators. The accumulators provide gimballing power prior to the main hydraulic pump operation, in the transient of separation of the two stages."
What component ensures that the main pump inlet maintains positive pressure during the operation of S-II's main-stage?," During the S-II main-stage operation, the main hydraulic pump supplies high-pressure fluid to each of the servo-actuators. The return fluid from the actuators is routed to the reservoir, which stores hydraulic fluid at suf ficient pressure to supply a positive pressure at the main pump inlet [ 11]. As has been shown in Chap."
What are the forces supported by the gimbal bearing in the Space Shuttle engines?," 2, Sect. 2.2,ag i m b a l l e de n g i n ei sm o u n t e do na spherical joint. In the three main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, the gimbal bearing is bolted to the vehicle by its upper flange and to the engine by its lower flange. It supports 33,271 N of engine weight and 2,224,000 N of thrust."
What components are interconnected in the described universal joint mechanism?, It is a ball-and-socket 468 5 Control Systems and Valves universal joint where concave and convex spherical surfaces are interconnected. Sliding contact occurs between these surfaces as the bearing is angulated. Fabroid® inserts located at the sliding contact surfaces reduce friction which occurs during gimbal bearing angulation.
What is the angular capability measurement of the bearing in radians?," The bearing, which is installed during engine assembly, measures approximately 27.9 cm ×36.6 cm, weighs about 467 N, has an angular capability of ±0.218 rad ( ±12.5 deg) and is made of a titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-6 V- 2Sn). It is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [7]."
What component is illustrated in the figure used to adjust the thrust direction of the F-1 engine in the Saturn V rocket?," The following figure, adapted from [ 13], illustrates a typical hydraulic servo- actuator, installed to gimbal the F-1 engine of the S-IC stage of the Saturn V rocket vehicle. 5.6 Control of Thrust Direction 469 Ad e t a i l e de x a m p l eo fd e s i g no fac o n t r o ls y s t e mf o rar o c k e te n g i n em o u n t e do n gimbals can be found, for example, in [ 14]."
What are the main components used to measure and regulate fluid motion in liquid-propellant rocket engines?," 5.7 Principal Components of Flow Control Systems Liquid-propellant rocket engines have several components which measure and control the motion of fluids through them. The principal components used for this purpose are valves, pressure regulators, and flow-meters. They are described here and in the following sections."
"What characteristics define the ideal fluid as described in the context, compared to real fluids?"," As i m p l ea n a l y s i so f fl o wc o n t r o ld e v i c e sc a nb ed o n eb yc o n s i d e r i n g fi r s t l y the motion of an ideal fluid, and then the corrections which are necessary to take account of the behaviour of real fluids. For example, a liquid can be considered inviscid, incompressible, and moving in laminar flow (see below) through a tube."
What energy types are included in the total energy of an ideal fluid in steady motion according to the Bernoulli principle?," The Bernoulli principle, so called after the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli, applies to this case. According to this principle, the total energy (potential energy plus pressure energy plus kinetic energy) possessed by an ideal fluid in steady motion between any two cross sections 1 and 2 of a tube is constant."
What does z represent in the expression of the Bernoulli principle regarding fluid dynamics?," By considering the total energy per unit weight, the Bernoulli principle can be expressed as follows z1+p1 rho g0+v2 1 2g0=z2+p2 rho g0+v2 2 2g0 where z(m) is the elevation of the chosen point with respect to a reference plane, p(N/m2)i st h ea b s o l u t ep r e s s u r ei nt h e fl u i di nt h ec h o s e np o i n t , rho (kg/m3)i st h e density of the fluid in all points at the given temperature, g0=9."
What is the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area for fluid flow in a tube at different sections?,"80665 m/s2is the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth, and v(m/s) is the velocity of the fluid in the chosen point along a stream line. When the flow takes place at a constant elevation, then z1=z2,a n dt h e r e f o r et h e preceding equation may be written as follows 470 5 Control Systems and Valves p1 - p2 rho g0=v2 2 - v2 1 2g0 In addition, due to the continuity of the flow, the product rho vAhas the same value at any cross section of area Aalong the tube, and therefore v1 v2=A2 A1 where A1(m2)a n d A2(m2)a r et h ea r e a so fa n yt w oc r o s ss e c t i o n sa l o n gt h et u b e ."
What determines the volume flow rate q(m3/s) in a fluid control system using the equations mentioned?," The preceding equations can be used to measure the volume flow rate q(m3/s) of a fl u i dt h r o u g ha fl u i dc o n t r o ls y s t e m ,a sw i l lb es h o w nb e l o w . The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 15], shows a longitudinal section of a flow-meter based on the Venturi tube."
What are the three main components of a device that measures the volume flow rate of fluid in a pipe?," A Venturi-meter, so called after the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Venturi, is ad e v i c ew h i c hm e a s u r e st h ev o l u m e fl o wr a t eo fal i q u i dm o v i n gi nap i p e .

What is the approximate included angle of the convergent cone in degrees?," The included angle of the convergent cone is approximately 0.3665 rad (21°), and the included angle of the diffuser cone ranges from 0.1222 rad (7°) to 0.2618 rad (15°). Two pressure taps are placed one at the inlet of the convergent cone and the other at the throat. A Venturi-meter is based on the Bernoulli principle."
What happens to the pressure head and velocity head when the tube's cross-sectional area reduces towards the throat?," When the cross-sectional area of the tube decreases from the inlet plane to the throat, then the pressure head p/( rho g0)o ft h e fl u i di sf o r c e dt od e c r e a s e ,a n di t sv e l o c i t yh e a d v2/(2g0)i sf o r c e dt oi n c r e a s e ,i no r d e rf o ri t st o t a lh e a dt ob ec o n s t a n t ."
How can the volume flow rate be expressed in relation to the difference in static pressure between two points?,"T h ed e c r e a s e in static pressure is measurable at the two taps (usually, by reading the difference of head in open vertical tubes inserted through the wall of the tube under pressure), and the volume flow rate qcan be expressed as a function of the decrease in static pressure p1 - p2,a sw i l lb es h o w nb e l o w ."

How does the discharge coefficient affect the actual volume flow rate in a Venturi-meter compared to the theoretical value?," In practice, some loss of total head occurs in a Venturi-meter due to friction, and therefore the actual value of the volume flow rate qis slightly lower than the theoret- ical value resulting from the preceding equation. This loss can be taken into account by means of a discharge coef ficient Cd,w h o s ev a l u ei sd e t e r m i n e de x p e r i m e n t a l l y and is always less than unity, as follows q=CdA2⎡ ⎢⎣2(p1 - p2) rho 1 - ⎦parenleftBig A2 A1⎦parenrightBig2⎤ ⎥⎦1 2 =CdA2⎡ ⎢⎣2g0∆Hp 1 - ⎦parenleftBig A2 A1⎦parenrightBig2⎤ ⎥⎦1 2 When the volume flow rate q(m3/s) of a given fluid has been determined by means of a Venturi-meter, as has been shown above, then the mass flow rate ."
How is the mass flow rate of a fluid calculated using volume flow rate and fluid density?," m(kg/s)of the same fluid results by multiplying the volume flow rate qby the density rho (kg/m3)o f the fluid at the temperature of interest. 472 5 Control Systems and Valves As an example of application of the concepts exposed above, it is required to calculate the mass flow rate of liquid oxygen flowing through an horizontal Venturi- meter which has the following properties: diameter at the inlet plane Din=0."
What is the calculated flow rate when the pressure head difference is 13.86 m and the density of liquid oxygen is 1141 kg/m³?,"1524 m, diameter at the throat plane Dt=0.0762 m, and discharge coef ficient Cd=0.92. The difference of pressure head measured between the inlet and the throat is ∆Hp =13.86 m, and the density of liquid oxygen at its boiling point is rho =1141 kg/m3 [16]. By substituting these data in the preceding equation, the volume flow rate results q=0."

What is the relationship between shear stress and velocity gradient in a Newtonian fluid undergoing one-dimensional motion?," The fluids for which the rate of deformation is proportional to the shear stress applied to them are called Newtonian fluids, after Isaac Newton. In case of a one-dimensional motion of a Newtonian fluid along a direction x(planar Couette flow), this linear relationship can be expressed as follows τxy=µdv dy where τxy(N/m2) is the shear stress, dv/dy(s - 1)i st h er a t eo fs h e a rs t r a i n ,t h a ti s , the velocity gradient in the direction yperpendicular to the direction xof motion, v equivalent v(y)( m / s )i st h ev e l o c i t yo fm o t i o ni nt h ed i r e c t i o n x,a n d µ(Ns/m2)i st h e coef ficient of dynamic viscosity of the fluid."
What are the three types of fluid motion within a cylindrical tube?," The motion of a viscous fluid in a cylindrical tube may be either laminar or turbulent or transitional. The first two types of flow are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 17]. Av i s c o u s fl u i di nl a m i n a r fl o wr e g i m e( l e f t )m o v e ss m o o t h l yi nt h i nl a y e r s ,c a l l e d laminae, which do not mix together."
What is the flow profile of the layers in a tube with stationary walls compared to a viscous fluid in turbulent flow?," The layers in contact with the walls of the tube 5.7 Principal Components of Flow Control Systems 473 are stationary, whereas the internal layers move by sliding one over another. The velocity of the layers increases from the walls to the central line of the tube with a parabolic pro file. By contrast, a viscous fluid in turbulent flow regime (right) moves irregularly with eddies and swirls which mix the layers of fluid together."
What type of flow exists in the thin layer adjacent to the walls of a tube during turbulent flow conditions?," The mean velocity pro file for turbulent flow is approximately elliptic (blunt nose) and is characterised by a much higher shear stress, due to the slope of the velocity pro file at the walls [ 17]. Even in conditions of turbulent flow, a thin layer (called boundary layer) exist near each wall of the tube where the fluid moves in laminar flow regime."
What does the Reynolds number indicate regarding the transition between smooth and chaotic fluid motion?," At r a n s i t i o n a l fl o w fl u c t u a t e sb e t w e e nl a m i n a r fl o wa n dt u r b u l e n t fl o w .W h e nt h i s happens, a laminar flow is on the verge of becoming turbulent. Ac r i t e r i o nt oi n d i c a t ew h e t h e rt h em o t i o no fa fl u i do c c u r si nl a m i n a ro rt u r b u l e n t flow is provided by the value of the Reynolds number."
What variable in the Reynolds number calculation represents the mean velocity of fluid in the tube?," As has been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.5,t h eR e y n o l d sn u m b e r Reis de fined as follows Re= rho vd µ where rho (kg/m3)i st h ed e n s i t yo ft h e fl u i da tt h eg i v e nt e m p e r a t u r e , v(m/s) is the mean velocity of the fluid in the tube, d(m) is the hydraulic diameter of the tube, andµ(N s m - 2)i st h ec o e f fi c i e n to fd y n a m i cv i s c o s i t yo ft h e fl u i da tt h eg i v e n temperature."
What type of fluid flow occurs when the Reynolds number is low?," The Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces which act on a unit volume of fluid moving in a tube. For low values of the Reynolds number, the viscous forces are suf ficiently high to keep the fluid particles in parallel layers, and consequently the flow is laminar. For high values of the Reynolds number, the inertial forces prevail over the viscous forces, and consequently the flow is turbulent."
What occurs in fluid flow when the Reynolds number is between 2300 and 4000?," For practical purposes, when the value of the Reynolds number is less than 2000, then the flow is laminar. The transition value for a fluid moving in a tube of circular cross section is Re=2300. When the value of the Reynolds number ranges from about 2300 and 4000, then the flow is unstable, due to an incipient turbulence."
What occurs when the Reis value exceeds 4000 in fluid flow?," When the value of Reis greater than 4000, then the flow is turbulent. The friction forces acting on the particles of a fluid moving in a tube are due to the rubbing of the particles one against another and also against the walls of the tube.

"What equation relates the pressure head drop due to friction in a tube to the Darcy friction factor, tube length, hydraulic diameter, and fluid velocity?"," This heat may either remain into the fluid or be transferred to the external environment through the walls. As has also been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.5,t h ed r o po fp r e s s u r eh e a d ∆Hp(m) due to friction in a tube of length L(m) and hydraulic diameter d(m) is expressed as a function of the Darcy friction factor fD(dimensionless) of the tube by means of the Darcy-Weisbach equation, as follows ∆Hp=fDL d⎦parenleftbiggv2 2g0⎦parenrightbigg 474 5 Control Systems and Valves where v(m/s) is the average velocity of the fluid, and g0=9."
What factors influence the Darcy friction factor in a tube?,80665 m/s2is the accel- eration of gravity near the surface of the Earth. The Darcy friction factor fDdepends on the Reynolds number Rede fined above and also on the shape and smoothness of the tube. This factor can be determined as a function of the Reynolds number Reand of the relative roughness ε/dof the tube not only by means of the Colebrook-White relation (see Chap.

What term is used to account for additional losses in a piping system due to fittings?,", which may be present in a piping system, causes further losses due to friction. These losses can be taken into account by means of a fictitious term Le(m), called equivalent length, which adds to the actual length L(m) of the pipe. By so doing, the Darcy-Weisbach equation written above becomes ∆Hp=fD⎦parenleftbiggL+Le d⎦parenrightbigg⎦parenleftbiggv2 2g0⎦parenrightbigg In other words, the actual length Lof a tube and its equivalent length Le,w h i c h takes account of all the fittings placed along the tube, are summed up to form a total length L+Le,w h i c hi nt u r ni si n t r o d u c e di nt h eD a r c y - W e i s b a c he q u a t i o ni n s t e a d of the actual length L."
What ratio is approximately constant for various sizes of a specific type of fitting according to experimental findings?,"T h ee q u i v a l e n tl e n g t h s Lefor a range of sizes of a given type of fitting have been found experimentally to be in an approximately constant ratio to the diameters dof the fittings. In other words, Le/d≈constant. Therefore, a single value is suf ficient to cover all sizes of each fitting."
What equation is used to compute the total drop of pressure head when applying the K-method for fittings?," A table, which can be found in [19], gives the values of the Le/dratio for many valves and other typical fittings. Another method, called K-method, takes account of the pressure drop due to the fittings by means of a resistance coef ficient kassigned to each type of fitting. When this method is used, the total drop of pressure head can be computed by using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, as follows ∆Hp=⎦parenleftBigg fDL d+N⎦summationdisplay i=1ki⎦parenrightBigg⎦parenleftbiggv2 2g0⎦parenrightbigg Values of the coef ficient kfor several fittings can be found in [ 20]."
What specific applications must be computed for the rocket engine's oxidiser pump and the fully open main oxidiser valve?," Other methods are those called the 2-K (Hooper) method and the 3-K (Darby) method. They are re finements of the K method described above. Particulars and values of the coef- ficients to be used in the 2-K method and in the 3-K method can be found in [21,22]. As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to compute the drop of pressure head for the discharge flexible duct of the oxidiser pump of a rocket engine and also for the main oxidiser valve, which is of the butter fly type, fully open."
What is the equivalent length of the flexible duct given that the inside diameter is 0.2032 m?," The following data are known: volume flow rate of liquid oxygen in the flexible duct q=0.7836 m3/s, inside diameter of the flexible duct d=0.2032 m, actual length of the flexible duct L=0.4064 m, equivalent length of the flexible duct (due to the resistance arising from flow deviation) Le=6d=6×0.2032 =1."

The density and the dynamic viscosity of liquid oxygen at its boiling point are respectively rho =1141 kg/m3andµ=1.95 ×10 - 4Ns/m2[16]."

What type of leakage occurs from a valve to the external environment?," Static seals (such as O-ring seals and gaskets) for stationary surfaces are also considered here. The dynamic seals used for turbo-pumps of rocket engines have been described in Chap. 4, Sect. 4.13. The leakage from a valve may be either internal leakage, which occurs in the direc- tion of the flow, or external leakage, which occurs from a valve to the external environ- ment, in a direction which differs from the normal direction of the flow."
What are the potential consequences mentioned for leakage of fluids in valve systems?," According to Howell and Weathers [ 25], the factors affecting the leakage requirements for valves are: •loss of pressure or loss of propellant, to be prevented or kept below an acceptable value in order to avoid system failure due to premature depletion of fluid; •damage to the system, such as corrosion or fire, which might occur as a result of leakage of propellants; •damage to personnel, which may occur in case of leakage of fluids which are toxic for inhalation or exposure; and •interference with experiments, which might occur in case of gases under pressure or propellants enveloping a spacecraft whose mission is to sample the atmosphere of a planet."
What is the maximum pressure range for valves used in rocket engines as mentioned in the survey?, The following seals are considered here: •seals for valves operating at high pressures and temperatures; and •seals for valves operating at cryogenic temperatures. Burmeister et al. [ 26]h a v em a d eas u r v e yo nt h em a t t e r .Ab r i e fa c c o u n to ft h i s survey is given below. Valves for rocket engines operate at pressures ranging from zero to 6.
What are the three main types of valves that can operate under high pressures and temperatures?,"895 ×108N/m2,a n da tt e m p e r a t u r e sr a n g i n gf r o mc r y o g e n i cv a l u e st o over 1366 K. They can be classi fied into three principal categories, which are •plug valves; •gate valves; and •globe valves. 5.8 Static and Dynamic Seals for Leakage Control in Valves 479 All of these valves can be used at high pressures and temperatures."
What type of valve is illustrated with a tapered plug and features a hole drilled in the middle?," Valves of other types, such as butter fly or vane valves, fall into one of these categories or into some combination of them. A tapered plug valve is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]. Ap l u gv a l v eh a sat a p e r e do rc y l i n d r i c a lp l u gw i t hah o l ed r i l l e di nt h em i d d l e ."
What happens to the fluid passage when the plug in a valve is rotated?," When this plug is rotated, the position of the hole opens, or restricts, or closes the passage of a fluid through the valve. A plug valve can be operated in an intermediate position, in order to throttle the flow. Simple quarter-turn valves, such as the one shown in the preceding figure, are limited in high-pressure application by the rapid increase in operating torque with increasing difference of pressure."
What factors influence the operating torque of a tapered plug valve?," When the fluid has access to either the large end or the small end of a tapered plug, then a force unbalance arises into or out of the valve body. The operating torque depends on the plug taper. The purpose of a tapered plug valve is to shut off flow in a leak-tight manner. When the thickness of the lubricant film is not uniform, then leakage occurs."
What three primary roles does the lubricant serve in Nordstrom-type plug valves?," The lubricant may be washed away by the fluid when unseating the plug, or may also be extruded by the difference of pressure. The three functions ful filled by the lubricant (lubrication, plug unseating, and viscous sealing) are combined in plug valves of the Nordstrom type, such as the valve shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]."
What maximum temperatures can a tapered plug valve withstand according to the specifications provided?, 480 5 Control Systems and Valves Av a l v eo ft h i st y p ec a nb e a rah i g h e rp r e s s u r et h a nt h em a x i m u mp r e s s u r eb e a r - able by an ordinary tapered plug valve. An increase in temperature degrades the properties of the lubricant-sealant. Maximum temperatures bearable by this type of valve are about 700 K or 800 K.
What property of the lubricant-sealant prevents grease application in extremely low-temperature environments?," The high viscosity of the lubricant-sealant at very low temperatures precludes application of grease at cryogenic temperatures. Ag a t ev a l v eo p e n so rc l o s e st h ep a s s a g eo f fl u i di nap i p eb yr a i s i n go rl o w e r i n g a fl a tp l a t ea c r o s st h ep i p e .T h i sp l a t es l i d e so v e rs e a l i n gs u r f a c e si nad i r e c t i o n perpendicular to the fluid stream in the pipe, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]."
What properties of sealing materials are crucial for gate valves in relation to stress and movement?," 5.8 Static and Dynamic Seals for Leakage Control in Valves 481 The sealing surfaces of a gate valve must bear the stresses induced by moving the plate from the fully open to the fully closed position. Therefore, the galling properties of the materials used and their ability to withstand stresses are very important."
What happens to the galling tendency and strength as temperature rises in materials?," As a general rule, the galling tendency increases and the strength decreases with increasing temperature. To provide good sealing surfaces, the gate and the seat must be flat. Therefore, a gate valve must be thick, especially in large valves subject to high pressures. Gate valves and tapered plug valves can be protected from leakage by using viscous sealing."
What is the relationship between the injection pressure of the sealant and the fluid pressure in the pipe?," For this purpose, a sealant is injected into grooves located around the flow passage in the gate or in the seat, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]. In the valve shown in the preceding figure, the injection pressure of the sealant is proportional to the pressure of the fluid which moves in the pipe."
What advantage does a tapered gate valve provide over traditional parallel slide gate valves regarding contact between the seat and gate?," Gate valves using viscous sealants have lower operating torques than conventional parallel slide gate valves. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26], shows a tapered gate valve, which makes it unnecessary to slide the gate across the entire sealing surface. 482 5 Control Systems and Valves The seat and the gate are not in mutual contact when the gate has been lifted by part of its total travel."
What effect does the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion have on a tapered gate valve when it cools after being closed at high temperatures?," Side ribs on a tapered gate valve resist the action exerted by the flow impingement and by the difference of pressure, which tends to move the gate toward the downstream seat, and keep the sealing surfaces from sliding contact. When a tapered gate valve is closed at a high temperature and then cools down, then the gate tends to bind, because the gate and the body parts have different coef ficients of thermal expansion."
What type of gate valves should be used to prevent leakage at high temperatures?," This can be avoided by using flexible tapered gates for valves operating at high temperatures. Gate valves not using viscous sealants are subject to leakage, and therefore are not used in case of high pressures. Gate valves using viscous sealants can bear gas and petroleum pressures as high as 1.034 ×108N/m2."
What are the materials used for inserts in valves designed to prevent fluid contamination?,"G a t ev a l v e ss e a l e db yi n s e r t s made of elastomers or fluorocarbons are used when contamination of the fluid is to be avoided. However, the pressure which these valves can bear is limited by plastic flow of these inserts. Globe valves are those used in water taps to start or stop or regulate the flow in a pipe."
What shape is the moving member that interacts with the stationary ring seat?," They have a moving member which is pushed into the flow passage, as a cork is pushed into the neck of a bottle, and a stationary member, which is a ring seat. The moving member is shaped as a cone frustum, which fits into the mating body seat, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]."
What characteristic of a cone frustum contributes to its resistance against distortion from fluid pressure compared to a tapered plug valve?, The included angle of this cone frustum is much greater than that of a plug used in a tapered plug valve. 5.8 Static and Dynamic Seals for Leakage Control in Valves 483 As e a ts h a p e da sac o n ef r u s t u mi sv e r yr e s i s t a n tt od i s t o r t i o n so ft h ev a l v eb o d y due to the pressure exerted by the fluid.
What types of materials are used for the sealing surfaces in globe valves?," In addition, should such distortions occur, the elastic deformation in the seat tends to maintain satisfactory sealing contact. Globe valves lend themselves to be used in cases of high pressures and temperatures. Of course, the materials used in such cases must be carefully selected. The sealing surfaces of these valves are made of cobalt-chromium alloys, such as the Stellites®, or of other materials such as carbides and ceramics."
What is the maximum pressure commercial globe valves can withstand at atmospheric temperatures?," However, these materials have low resistance to impact. Globe valves are widely used for high-pressure and high- temperature applications. Commercial valves of this type are available for pressures up to 1.034 ×108N/m2at atmospheric temperatures, and also for pressures of 0.3447 ×108N/m2at a temperature of 922 K [ 26]."
What components are essential for ensuring the closure and fluid control within a valve body?," Since the inner parts of a valve must be contained into the body of the valve, which also contains the fluid under pressure, then it is necessary to provide some means of closure or cover. In addition, an operating mechanism for flow control must be contained into the valve body. Therefore, at least two seals are necessary to a valve."
What are the limitations of a flat gasket for cover sealing in terms of pressure and temperature applications?," These seals are illustrated in the preceding figure, with reference to a globe valve. However, they are also necessary with valves of other types. Cover sealing can be obtained in several ways, each of which has its maximum level of pressure and its cost. A fl a tg a s k e tf o rc o v e rs e a l i n g ,s h o w no nt h el e f t - h a n ds i d eo ft h ef o l l o w i n g figure, is not suited to either high-pressure or high-temperature applications, because it requires large surfaces."
What materials are combined to create a spiral-wound gasket?," Other types of gaskets which are better suited to these applications are the spiral-wound gaskets and the lens ring gasket. A spiral-wound gasket is shown (right), in comparison with a flat gasket (left), in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]. 484 5 Control Systems and Valves As p i r a l - w o u n dg a s k e ti sm a d eo faV - s h a p e dm e t a l l i cs t r i po rr i b b o nm i x e dw i t ha non-metallic filler material."
What materials are typically used for the metal and filler in the described winding process?," The metal (usually stainless steel) is wound outwards in a circular spiral, and the filler material (usually graphite or poly-tetra- fluoro-ethylene, whose commercial name is Te flon®)i sw o u n di nt h es a m em a n n e r ,b u ts t a r t i n go n the opposite side. This results in alternating layers of filler and metal."
What materials are used for the inner and outer rings in the gasket?," The filler is the sealing element, and the metal provides structural strength to the gasket. For temperatures above 811 K, ceramic fibre fillers have been used [ 25]. An inner ring and an outer ring made of steel are used on the gasket for centring and controlling compression.

What is the purpose of a metallic ring gasket in relation to the flange grooves?," Al e n sr i n gg a s k e ti sm a d eo fas e a l i n gm e t a lo fl e n t i c u l a rs h a p ew h i c h fi t si n t ot h e recesses or grooves of a flange. Since the metallic ring is designed to be softer than the flange grooves, then the gasket deforms plastically under compressive loads instead of the flange."
What type of gaskets are suitable for pressures not exceeding 6?," This deformation spreads the gasket faces, and therefore protects the gasket from overstresses. 5.8 Static and Dynamic Seals for Leakage Control in Valves 485 In a spiral-wound gasket and in a lens ring gasket, the sealing stress is proportional to the internal pressure. Lens ring gaskets are suitable for pressures of 6."
What type of seal is characterized by sealing stress proportional to internal pressure and is placed in a specially designed groove?,"895 ×108 N/m2and above [ 26]. The O-ring is another type of static or dynamic seal, in which the sealing stress is proportional to the internal pressure. An O-ring is placed in a groove which is designed to provide a radial or lateral containment, depending upon the speci fic application. As pressure increases, an O-ring deforms as shown on the left-hand side of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]."
What is the purpose of the holes in the metallic O-ring?," The same figure also shows, on the right-hand side, a metallic O-ring having holes to admit the fluid under pressure into the ring, in order to make the sealing stress proportional to the pressure exerted by the fluid contained in the valve. Metallic O-rings may also be coated with elastomers or fluorocarbons to provide better sealing."
"What are the two additional types of seals mentioned, and on which sides of the figure are they illustrated?"," They are suitable for high pressures, but are also easily damaged, and therefore must be installed in specially designed split grooves [ 26]. Two further types of seals are the pressure sealing ring and the lapped seal, which are shown on respectively the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]."
What components are involved in the sealing arrangement of a pressure sealing system?," Ap r e s s u r es e a l i n gr i n g( l e f t )c o n s i s t so fas e g m e n t e dr e t a i n i n gr i n g ,as p a c e rr i n g , and a gasket. A pressure sealing ring uses the displacement of one of its members to develop the sealing stresses. The gasket is initially wedged against the surface of the body by means of bolts."
What effect does increased internal pressure in a body have on the position of a gasket within its constraints?," When the internal pressure exerted by the fluid in the body increases, then the gasket is wedged more and more tightly against its constraints.

What types of seals can be used for body-cover joints according to the description?," This type of seal is suited to either radial or axial installation, as shown in the preceding figure. Body-cover joints can also be sealed by using a fillet-weld seal or a canopy seal, which are shown on respectively the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]."
What is the primary function of a canopy seal in relation to mating parts?," A fi l l e t - w e l ds e a l( l e f t )i sp e r f o r m e db yd e p o s i t i n ga fi l l e tw e l db e a da tt h ei n t e r f a c e of the mating parts. A canopy seal (right) is similar to a fillet-weld seal and is used where a slight movement of the mating parts is expected. Other types of seals for valves used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications are described in [ 25,26]."
"At what temperature do permanent gases transition from gas to liquid at atmospheric pressure, as referred to in the provided information?"," Valves operating at cryogenic temperatures and seals used for them also require ac a r e f u ld e s i g n .A sh a sb e e ns h o w ni nC h a p .1 ,S e c t . 1.4,b yc r y o g e n i c fl u i d sw e mean gases which can be lique fied at or below 122 K [ 27]. Permanent gases, such as methane, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium, change from gas to liquid at atmospheric pressure at the temperatures shown in the following table (due to the courtesy of NIST [ 28]), called the normal boiling point (NBP)."
What is the temperature in Kelvin at which liquid helium transitions to a super fluid state?," Such liquids are known as cryogenic liquids or cryogens. Liquid helium, when cooled further to 2.17 K or below, becomes a super fluid with very unusual properties associated with being in the quantum mechanical ground state. Cryogen Temperature (K) Methane 111.7 Oxygen 90.2 Nitrogen 77.4 Hydrogen 20."
What are the two key requirements for valve design at cryogenic temperatures outlined by Howell and Weathers?,"3 Helium 4.2 According to Howell and Weathers [ 25], in the design of valves operating at cryogenic temperatures, the following requirements are to be taken into account: 5.8 Static and Dynamic Seals for Leakage Control in Valves 487 •reduction of heat transfer from the external environment to the valve, in order to prevent excessive losses of cryogenic fluid by evaporation; and •reduction of heat transfer between temperature-sensitive parts of valves in cryogenic fluids."
What type of material is recommended for constructing a thermal barrier to protect temperature-sensitive components from the valve body?," Am e t h o do f t e nu s e dt ot h e r m a l l yi n s u l a t et e m p e r a t u r e - s e n s i t i v ep a r t so fv a l v e s (for example, actuators) from the valve body which contains the cryogenic fluid consists in placing a thermal barrier made of a non-metallic material having a low thermal conductivity (for example, Te flon®)b e t w e e nt h ev a l v eb o d ya n dt h ep a r tt o be insulated."
"What types of metals are typically utilized for cryogenic valves, specifically focusing on ductile and low conductivity characteristics?"," Ductile metals of low conductivity which are often used for cryogenic valves are austenitic stainless steels (usually the lower-carbon 304, also known as 18/8, and the ever lower-carbon 304L), aluminium alloys, copper, ASTM B-61 and B- 62 bronzes, and nickel [ 26]. In addition to using materials of low thermal conductivity, other methods are also used for the same purpose."
What are two methods to prevent heat conduction in valves as described?," These methods are: •breaking completely the path of heat conduction, by separating the parts which operate at different temperatures by an insulating space (for example, in a broken stem valve, the valve actuator is thermally insulated from the valve body by means of radial bars on the upper stem which drive against axial pins on the lower stem) and enclosing the entire valve in an evacuated chamber; •using vacuum-jacketed valves; •increasing the path of heat conduction, by using extended stems and bonnets including long gaseous columns, in order to keep the stem seal packings exposed only to insulating vapour, and not to the cold liquid; •providing bonnets with integral black-coated fins, to direct heat away through radiation from the packing to the external environment; •using plastiform insulating foams, made of polystyrene, polyurethane, rubber, silica, and glass, around the valve body; and •using low-density materials, such as powders and fibres, with gas at atmospheric pressure in the interstitial spaces."
What feature of the valve design minimizes the cool-down mass?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26], shows a vacuum-jacketed valve used for cryogenic fluids, where the inner wall surrounds the primary pressure vessel, and the outer wall is of light construction to reduce to cool-down mass. Brightly finished interior surfaces may be used to reduce radiative heat transfer."
What is the purpose of circulating another cryogenic fluid in the interstitial space of a vacuum-jacketed valve?," 488 5 Control Systems and Valves In some cases, especially when the cryogenic fluid is liquid helium, a valve is surrounded with a vacuum-jacket, then another cryogenic fluid (usually liquid nitrogen) is circulated in the interstitial space between the two walls to act as a thermal radiation shield, and finally an insulating foam is placed as an outside covering [ 26]."
What materials are commonly used for trim parts of valves designed for cryogenic fluids?," It is possible to have insulating foam bonded to the surface of the insulation cavity. This type of insulation, usually called “foamed in place” is quite adaptable to valves and other components having irregular surfaces [ 25]. Trim parts, such as plugs and stems, of valves for cryogenic fluids are often made of stainless steel or Monel®, which is a nickel-copper alloy."
What materials are utilized for valve seats in fluorine applications?, Te flon®and Kel-F®/Neo flon®are commonly used for seats. Valves for fluorine have often seats made of copper. Bushings made of Ampco®(aluminium bronze) have been successfully used with stems made of stain- less steel. Bushings are also made of Te flon®or glass-impregnated Te flon®.P a c k i n g is made of pure or filled Te flon®and Kel-F®/Neo flon®.
What materials are suitable for gaskets when handling fluorine?,"W e l d e db e l l o w sa r es o m e - times used instead of packings. Gaskets are made of Te flon®or metal-clad Te flon®. Rings made of stainless steel are used in ring-type joint flanges. Fluorine requires soft copper, aluminium 25, or stainless steel for gaskets [ 26]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26], shows a cryogenic fluid valve whose vacuum-insulating jacket encloses the entire body."
What feature prevents the transmission of strains in the expansion bellows attached to the piping jacket?," An expansion bellows for attachment to a piping jacket is provided to prevent the transmission of strains. Air is sealed in the stem cylinder to achieve long, poorly conductive path, and a vapour space is provided between the cylinder and the body extension. Heat transfer is also reduced by the absence of bolts or studs in the valve body [ 26]."
What type of gaskets is limited to reinforced or laminated Teflon® for use in specific applications?," 5.8 Static and Dynamic Seals for Leakage Control in Valves 489 Most of the principal seals considered above for high-pressure and high- temperature applications may also be used for cryogenic fluids. However, special care is necessary because of the different properties of the materials. The use of soft plastic gaskets is limited to reinforced or laminated Te flon®."
What materials are utilized in high shear-stress loading applications according to the information provided?," Thin gaskets made of hard plastics, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), whose trade name is Mylar®,m a yb eu s e di nc a s eo fh i g hs t r e s sl o a d i n g .S o f tm e t a l s , such as copper and aluminium, may be used in case of high shear-stress loading. The following figure, re-drawn from [ 25], shows two gasket gland designs used for cryogenic service."
What types of O-rings can be utilized as seals for fluids at extremely low temperatures?," They are: (left) a rounded-edge seal ring, and (right) a knife-edge shear seal. The following figure, re-drawn from [ 25], shows some installation techniques for using elastomeric O-rings in cryogenic applications. 490 5 Control Systems and Valves Metallic O-rings, either solid or hollow, may be used as seals for cryogenic fluids."
What materials are noted for providing optimal performance in solid rings used in valve designs?," In particular, solid rings made of soft metals such as copper, indium, or lead have given the best results. When using indium, care must be taken to con fine the gland because of the cold- flow tendency of this metal [ 25]. 5.9 Design of Propellant Valves 491 5.9 Design of Propellant Valves The valves described in the present section are principally used to initiate and termi- nate the flow of propellants from the tanks to the main combustion chamber and to the gas generator of a rocket engine."
What type of valves allows for continuous adjustment of their operating position for flow rate control?," Therefore, these valves are often of the open- closed, two-position, normally closed type. However, some valves are also required to control the flow rate of propellants by means of a restriction of variable area. Valves of the latter type are used for thrust-throttle and propellant-mixture-ratio control, because they can continuously vary their operating position, in contrast to shut-off valves, which are either fully open or fully closed."
What are the essential criteria for propellant valves to ensure effective operation in a closed position?," Requirements for propellant valves are compatibility with propellants, structural strength, absence of leakage in closed position, proper actuation time when opening or closing, and minimum pressure loss. Apart from the general classi fication considered in Sect. 5.8,w ed e s c r i b eh e r ei n particular the most used types of propellant valves, which are butter fly valves, ball valves, poppet valves, Venturi valves, gate valves, and needle valves."
What is the function of the flat element located in a butterfly valve?," An isometric cross section of a butter fly valve is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 29]. Ab u t t e r fl yv a l v ei su s e dt os t a r t ,r e g u l a t e ,o rs t o pt h em o t i o no fa fl u i di nad u c t . With reference to the preceding figure, the movable part of a butter fly valve is a flat element, called the disc, which may be rotated to control the flow through the valve body."
What is the range of internal diameters for butterfly valves used in propellants?," The disc can rotate on a single-piece shaft or on a two-piece shaft, which 492 5 Control Systems and Valves extends across the diameter of an ori fice and supports the disc on both sides. The internal diameter of existing butter fly valves ranges from 50 to 400 mm. These valves are used for propellants at absolute pressures ranging from 1."
What is the purpose of offsetting the center of rotation of the disc in relation to the primary seal?,"4 ×105to 1×107N/m2 [3] For greater rigidity, the shaft may be integral with the disc. The centre of rotation of the disc is usually offset, as shown in the preceding figure, in order to allow the disc to rotate off the primary seal. For low leakage, a plastic lip seal (described in Chap. 4, Sect. 4.13)i su s u a l l ye m p l o y e di nt h ev a l v eh o u s i n g ."
What shape of disc in butterfly valves has superior performance but higher manufacturing costs?," The discs of butter fly valves have spherical or conical shapes, as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 29]. A disc of spherical shape (left) has better performance, but is more expensive to fabricate. A disc of conical shape (right) is more subject to leakage because of greater wear [ 29]."
What materials are used for the shaft and pins in the described system?," Ab u t t e r fl yv a l v ei so p e r a t e db ya na c t u a t o ro ft h ep i s t o nt y p e ,t h r o u g hac o n n e c t i n g link and shaft crank arm. The actuating power is the pressure exerted by either a non- cryogenic liquid propellant or an inert gas, and is controlled by a pilot valve. The shaft and the pins are made of stainless steel, whereas most of the other parts are made of aluminium alloys."
How is the characteristic area of a butterfly valve calculated in relation to its diameter and projected disc area?," Butter fly valves oppose low resistance to the motion of propellants flowing through them. The characteristic area Ac(m2) of a butter fly valve results from Ac=πd2 s 4 - Ag where ds(m) is the inside diameter of the valve seat lip seal, and Ag(m2)i st h e projected valve disc area at the fully open position."
What is the range of Acrange for valve diameters from 50 mm to 300 mm?," The values of Acrange from 0.65 ×(πd2 s/4) for a 50 mm diameter valve to about 0.87 ×(πd2 s/4) for a 300 mm diameter valve [ 3]. Ab u t t e r fl yv a l v em a i n t a i n sas m o o t h fl o wo v e raw i d er a n g eo fa n g u l a rp o s i t i o n s of the valve disc. The values of the resistance coef ficient kas a function of the opening angle are given by the manufacturer of the valve or can be found, for example, in [30,31]."
What method is employed to prevent the freezing of RP-1 in actuator systems?," 5.9 Design of Propellant Valves 493 RP-1 is used sometimes as the actuating fluid for liquid-oxygen valves in rocket engines burning RP-1 with liquid oxygen. In this case, it is necessary to prevent RP-1 from freezing at the actuator by using a heater. A potentiometer is often attached to the drive shaft of a butter fly valve to indicate continuously the position of the valve disc."
"What two types of torque are involved in the operation of a butterfly valve, and how do they interact?"," The torque required to rotate the shaft and the disc of a butter fly valve depends on the hydraulic torque Th(Nm) and on the frictional torque Tf(Nm) acting on the valve. The frictional torque opposes always rotation. The hydraulic torque (in spite of the offset of the disc, which is always placed on the side opposite to the direction of the flow, as shown in the preceding figures) acts in the closing direction for most angular positions (from π/20 to 4 π/9 rad) of the disc."
What factors influence the frictional torque required to operate the butterfly valve?," The opening torque To(Nm) and the closing torque Tc(Nm) required to operate ab u t t e r fl yv a l v ec a nb ee x p r e s s e da sf o l l o w s To=Tf+Th Tc=Tf - Th where the hydraulic torque This supposed to act on the disc of the valve in the closing direction. The frictional torque Tfdepends on the difference of pressure on the two faces of the disc and also on the projected area of the disc, which in turn depends on the angular position of the disc in the valve."
What are the variables represented in the formula for frictional torque related to shaft and bearing interactions?," The value of the frictional torque can be estimated as follows Tf=kfrsfmd2 s∆p where kfis the friction factor coef ficient whose value is determined experimentally, rs(m) is the radius of the shaft at the bearing section, fmis the coef ficient of friction between the shaft and the bearing, ds(m) is the inside diameter of the valve seat lip seal, and ∆p(N/m2)i st h ed i f f e r e n c eo fp r e s s u r ea c r o s st h ed i s c ."
What range of torque must the actuator provide in the design of a butterfly valve?," The value of the hydraulic torque can be estimated as follows Th=khd3 s∆p where khis the hydraulic coef ficient whose value is determined experimentally and depends on the angular position of the disc in the valve. In the practical design of a butter fly valve, the actuator is required to provide a torque whose value ranges from two to three times the maximum estimated value necessary to open or close the valve."
What is the essential requirement for the actuator at the initiation of the opening movement of a butterfly valve?," In addition, at the start of the opening stroke, the actuator must overcome the static friction forces due to all seals. The opening and closing times of butter fly valves range from 0.02 to 0.2 s [ 3]. As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to determine the torques necessary to open and close a butter fly valve having the following data: radius of the valve shaft at the bearing section rs=0."
What is the inside diameter of the system described in the given data?,"02032 m, inside diameter of 494 5 Control Systems and Valves the valve seat lip seal ds=0.1956 m, coef ficient of friction between the shaft and the bearing fm=0.05.

What geometric shape is used in the construction of the valve that allows rotation to alter its state?,"02)=39.21 Nm An isometric cross section of a ball valve is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 29]. 5.9 Design of Propellant Valves 495 Ab a l lv a l v ei ss u b s t a n t i a l l yas p h e r ep r o v i d e dw i t hap o r ta n d fi t t i n gi n t oac u p - shaped housing, such that a rotation of this sphere through a right angle changes the position of the valve from open to closed."
What is the position of the ball when the valve is closed in relation to the flow openings?," In other words, when the valve is turned to the open position, the ball rotates to a point in which the hole through the ball is aligned with the flow openings (inlet and outlet) of the valve body. When the valve is turned to the closed position, the ball rotates to a point in which the hole through the ball is perpendicular to the flow openings of the valve body, and therefore the flow is stopped."
What are the two types of ball valves mentioned?," There are two common types of this valve. They are the fixed ball valve and the floating ball valve, which are shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 25]. 496 5 Control Systems and Valves In a fixed ball valve (left), the ball is supported by fixed bearings, and the seal is spring-loaded against the ball."
What provides the seating force in a floating ball valve?," The seal is mounted on the upstream side of the ball, and is usually designed to act in one direction only. However, another spring-loaded seal may also be mounted on the downstream side of the ball, in order to obtain a bi-directional sealing. In a floating ball valve (right), the ball is supported by fixed seals, and the seating force is provided by the fluid under pressure, which pushes the ball against the seat."
What type of materials can be used for the body of a ball valve?," In a floating ball valve, the seals are placed both upstream and downstream of the ball, and therefore the valve may be used in either direction. The use of floating ball valves is con fined to low-pressure applications. The materials used for the body of a ball valve may be metals or plastics, such as Unplasticised Polyvinyl Chloride (UPVC)."
What are the materials commonly used for seals in ball valves?," The ball may be made of metal or plastic. Metallic balls have highly polished, hard chrome surfaces. Seal materials may be plastics or elastomers. Te flon®is the most commonly used material for seals, due to its properties of high resistance to corrosion and low friction. The principal advantage of ball valves is a low pressure drop."
"What type of valve is used in the AJ10-138 rocket engine, as depicted in the provided isometric cross section?"," They also have a very good leakage control, and can be designed to operate equally well with the flow in either direction. On the other hand, the actuating forces required by them are high, because these valves cannot be pressure-balanced [ 25]. An isometric cross section of a poppet valve, used for the AJ10-138 rocket engine, is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 32]."
What type of valves are utilized in car engine cylinders and operate similarly to globe valves?," 5.9 Design of Propellant Valves 497 Poppet valves are those used in cylinders of car engines. They are similar to globe valves (described in Sect. 5.8), because for both of them the movable part of the valve travels perpendicularly to a plane through the seating surface. According to Howell and Weathers [ 25], the term poppet valve is used synonymously with globe valve."
What materials can be used to create a hard sealing surface in a poppet valve?," The designer of a poppet valve chooses the types of sealing surfaces, either hard or soft, which are best suited for the poppet and for the seat. These surfaces are said to be hard or soft depending on the type of material used. A hard sealing surface is made of a material (metal, ceramic, or cermet, the last being a composite material made of ceramic and metallic materials) which does not permanently yield or deform except with wear."
What materials are used to create a soft sealing surface?," By the way, flexible metallic discs are a special type of hard sealing surface. A soft sealing surface is made of plastic or elastomeric materials. Possible con figurations for combinations of hard and soft sealing surfaces are indicated below. Poppet sealing surface Seat sealing surface Con figuration designation Hard Hard Hard-on-hard Hard Soft Hard-on-soft Soft Hard Hard-on-soft The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 29]s h o w sf o u re x a m p l e so f hard-on-hard sealing con figurations."

This type of design is known as a soft-seat poppet. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 29]s h o w st y p i c a lc o n fi g u r a - tions for a soft-seat poppet."
What is the term used for a design that includes a soft sealing surface in the poppet?," 5.9 Design of Propellant Valves 499 It is also possible to incorporate the soft sealing surface either as an integral part of the poppet (for example, of a plastic poppet) or as an insert of elastomer or plastic in the poppet. This type of design is known as a soft poppet. In either location, the soft sealing insert is designated as a seal."
What type of devices are compatible with the poppet valve due to its short travel feature?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 29]s h o w sa ne l a s t o m e r i cs e a l insert retained in a poppet by a shrink- fit mechanical retainer. Al a r g e fl o wa r e ai nap o p p e tv a l v ei sp r o v i d e dw i t hs h o r tt r a v e lo ft h ep o p p e t . This makes it possible to use actuators such as solenoids or diaphragms, which are short-stroke devices."
What method can be employed to achieve effective pressure balancing in valves according to the provided information?," A very good leakage control can be achieved by using hard or 500 5 Control Systems and Valves soft seals, as has been shown above. When hard seals are used, great care must be taken to eliminate contamination from the fluid and from the duct upstream of the valves. Ap o p p e tv a l v ec a nb ep r e s s u r e - b a l a n c e db yu s i n gt w op o p p e t sw h i c ha r eo nt h e same stem and seat on separate seats."
What methods can create a counterbalancing force between two poppets?," By so doing, the pressure acting on the top of one poppet provides the counterbalancing force acting on the bottom of the other poppet. The same result can also be obtained by providing the poppet stem with a pressure-balancing piston area, or by making the poppet stem diameter equal to the seating diameter."
What is the required rotation for ball and butterfly valves to achieve full stroke functionality?," However, it is practically impossible to obtain complete pressure balance under both shut-off and flow conditions. Ap o p p e tv a l v ei sl i g h t e rt h a nv a l v e so fo t h e rt y p e sf o rm a n ya p p l i c a t i o n s ,d u e to the small stroke of its actuator. For example, ball and butter fly valves require a rotation through a right angle for full stroke, and therefore need a larger associated mechanism."
What valve type demonstrates optimal flow characteristics and operates quickly from zero to full flow with limited movement?," A poppet valve is used when the valve is desired to open rapidly from zero to full flow with a short travel of its movable element. Of all types of poppet valve, the in-line valve is the one which has the best flow properties. The body of ap o p p e tv a l v em a yb ee i t h e rc a s to no n ep i e c eo rs p l i t ."
What is controlled by the cavitating venturi valve in a rocket engine?,"I nt h el a t t e rc a s e ,t h eb o d y halves are joined by bolts [ 25].

What happens to the flow rate of a propellant during cavitation in a Venturi tube?," When the minimum pressure of a liquid propellant is made to decrease below its vapour pressure at the throat of a Venturi tube, then cavitation occurs and the propellant evaporates. In case of cavitation, the propellant flow rate is independent of the downstream pressure. Cavitation occurs by decreasing the pressure of a liquid propellant at the throat of a Venturi tube to such an extent that nearly all of the upstream pressure head of the fluid is converted into velocity head."
What happens to the fluid's static pressure at the throat when cavitation occurs?," When this occurs, the only static pressure remaining in the fluid at the throat is equal to the vapour pressure of the fluid itself. In such conditions, when the upstream pressure of the fluid is kept constant, a further decrease in downstream pressure does not result in increased flow rate, because cavitation at the throat maintains the pressure equal to the vapour pressure of the fluid."
What must the downstream pressure be less than to prevent cavitation when compared to the upstream pressure?," In other words, the flow rate through the valve remains constant for a given throat area and for a given upstream pressure, independently of the downstream pressure, provided that the downstream pressure does not increase above the level in which cavitation occurs. In practice, the downstream pressure must be less than 85% of the upstream pressure in order for cavitation to occur [ 25]."
What are the two types of pressure measurements necessary for designing a cavitating Venturi valve in rocket engines?," Cavitating Venturi valves are used in rocket engines when it is desired to prevent variations of propellant flow rate caused by variable back pressure on the control valve. In the design of a cavitating Venturi valve used to control flow rates, it is necessary to know the total pressure pT(N/m2)a n dt h ev a p o u rp r e s s u r e pv(N/m2) of the propellant whose flow rate is to be controlled."
What does the symbol 'rho' represent in relation to the properties of the propellant?," The ratio pT - pv rho g0 is the total pressure head available for conversion to velocity head in the Venturi tube. In the preceding equation, rho (kg/m3)i st h ed e n s i t yo ft h ep r o p e l l a n ta tt h eg i v e n temperature, and g0=9.80665 m/s2is the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the Earth."
How is the theoretical propellant velocity at the throat of the Venturi tube calculated using pressure head and gravitational constants?," The total pressure head ( pT - pv)/( rho g0)i su s e dt od e t e r m i n et h et h e o r e t i c a l value vt(m/s) of the propellant velocity at the throat of the Venturi tube, as follows pT - pv rho g0=v2 t 2g0 The actual volume flow rate q(m3/s) of propellant through the Venturi tube can be determined by assuming a discharge coef ficient of 0."
"What is the optimal range for the included angle of the diffuser cone in a cavitating Venturi valve, according to experimental findings?","93 [ 25].

What applications have Venturi valves been used for in rocket engines?," Venturi valves have been used successfully in rocket engines for cryogenic and storable propellants [ 3]. A cross section of a gate valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25]. Gate valves have been considered in Sect. 5.8from the point of view of sealing and leakage control. Their use as propellant valves is discussed below."
What mechanism is utilized for varying flow rates when opening or closing gate valves?, Gate valves have a flat plate which moves perpendicularly to the fluid stream in a duct in order to open or close the passage of the fluid through them. They may be operated by any of the usual actuators used for this purpose. Quick-return mechanisms have been used when it was desired to open or close such valves at different flow rates.
What advantage does a gate valve provide regarding fluid flow when it is fully open?," When the plate is completely removed from the fluid stream, a gate valve opposes little or no resistance to the flow. Consequently, the principal advantage of a gate valve is unrestricted fluid stream, and therefore low pressure drop when the valve is in the wide open position. When a gate valve is in the closed position, the contact surface between the plate and the seal extends along the whole circumference of the tube cross section, and therefore this valve provides good sealing, which results in little or no leakage across the plate."
What are the disadvantages of the valve design related to throttling performance and erosion when nearly closed?," 5.9 Design of Propellant Valves 503 Ag a t ev a l v eh a sas h o r td i s t a n c eb e t w e e nt h es e c t i o n so fi n l e ta n do u t l e ti nt h e direction of the flow. On the other hand, it has poor throttling properties and is also subject to erosion when they it is in the near closed position."
"What types of applications are gate valves specifically designed for, considering their pressure capability?"," Its response is slow, because of the large travel and the high actuation forces due to friction. Consequently, gate valves are normally used as on-off mechanisms. They have been designed for propellant line pressures up to 2 ×107N/m2[3]a n df o rl o wp r o p e l l a n t fl o wa p p l i c a - tions (for example, for gas generator control and ground support services)."
What is the primary reason gate valves are utilized in moderate pressure systems?," In ground support systems, they are used as shut-off or block valves in systems subject to moderate pressures. This is because they cannot be balanced. Gate valves have also been used for cryogenic propellants. An example is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 26]. The vent hole on the inlet end of this gate valve is necessary to avoid trapping liquid in the bonnet [ 26]."
What distinguishes an e needle valve from a globe valve regarding the control orifice size and the design of the movable element?," 504 5 Control Systems and Valves Ac r o s ss e c t i o no fan e e d l ev a l v ei ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,r e - d r a w nf r o m [25].

What construction feature of a needle valve enhances its ability to regulate small fluid flows?," A needle valve is used for regulating the flow of small quantities of fluid, for blending carefully a fluid with another, and for speed control of pumps and actuators. The construction property of a needle valve which makes it apt to be used for a fine flow control is the plug of the valve, which moves inside the seat ring and has long tapered slots milled and ground into its surface."
How does the position of the plug affect the flow control through the valve?," The plug remains inside the seat ring at all times, even when the valve is in the wide-open position, in order for the flow through the valve to be closely controllable by the relative position of the long plug and its gradually tapering grooves. A tight shut-off of a needle valve depends on the concentric position of the plug with the seat at the 5."
What materials are recommended for sealing in high-temperature or corrosive fluid applications when non-metallic seals are unsuitable?,"9 Design of Propellant Valves 505 point of closure. In case of need for a repeated shut-off of a needle valve, a good sealing is obtained by using a disc made of rubber or plastic which closes against a metallic seat. When a non-metallic seal cannot be used due to high temperatures or to the necessity of handling a corrosive fluid, then a non-rotating plug may be designed for closing against the seat, or a device may be used to limit the closing force applied to the stem to the amount strictly necessary for a tight shut-off."
What type of valves control fluids that manage components in hydraulic circuits or sequences in rocket engines?," Needle valves are used in lines whose diameter is less than 20 mm, a typical value being 6.35 mm. They are used for temperatures ranging from cryogenic values to 811 K and above, and for pressures ranging from vacuum to 2 ×108N/m2and above [ 25]. 5.10 Design of Pilot Valves Pilot valves are used to control fluids, which in turn control other components of hydraulic circuits (for example, valves for propellants) or a sequence of events occur- ring in a rocket engine (for example, the admission of fuel for ignition purposes)."
"What are the types of pilot valves mentioned, and what configurations do they commonly have?"," The control action performed by a pilot valve is of the on-off, open-loop type. The most common types of pilot valves are solenoid valves, pressure-actuated valves, and position-actuated valves in two-way, three-way, and four-way con figurations. As o l e n o i dv a l v ei sa ne l e c t r o m a g n e t i cd e v i c eh a v i n gas o l e n o i d ,w h i c hi sa helically wound coil of wire, a movable cylindrical core of ferromagnetic material mounted coaxially within the coil, a poppet, and a return spring."
What component closes a small opening when the coil is not conducting current?," This core is called the plunger. When the coil conducts no electric current, the compressed spring closes a small ori fice by means of the poppet. When a voltage is applied to the ends of the coil, the electric current flowing through the coil generates a magnetic field, which exerts a force on the plunger."
What effect does the force applied to the plunger have on the orifice in a solenoid valve?," This force pulls the plunger toward the centre of the coil, thereby opening the ori fice. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [32], shows a cross section of a solenoid valve having a spherical poppet. 506 5 Control Systems and Valves The following figure, re-drawn from [ 25], shows various shapes of poppets which can be actuated by a solenoid in a pilot valve."
What types of valves can solenoid actuators operate aside from simple on-off configurations?," Solenoid actuators can be used not only for simple, two-port, on-off valves, but also for multi-passage valves, in which the flow is directed to three or four ports, as required, as the sequel will show. Solenoid on-off valves are either normally open or normally closed, where the normal position of a valve is the position of its movable element with respect to the upstream pressure when no electric power is applied to the solenoid."
What causes the valve to return to its original position when electric power is cut off?," In the presence of an electric power, the solenoid places the valve to the desired position by attracting a magnetic core attached to the valve stem. When the electric power is removed, a spring pushes back the magnetic core to its normal position. Directly acting solenoid valves have response times ranging from 5 to 50 ms [ 25]."
What factors influence the electric current needed for valve operation?," Al a r g eo p e n i n gc a nb eo b t a i n e dt h r o u g has h o r ts t r o k eo ft h em o v a b l ee l e m e n t . The electric current required to operate these valves depends on their size, on the difference of pressure, and on the response required. Their leakage control is very good, particularly when a soft seat is used."
"What factors influence the attracting force acting on a plunger in a flat-faced, plunger-type magnetic core system?"," When a hard seat is used, it is advisable to lap the seat parts. Solenoid valves do not require external dynamic seals, and have av e r yl o n go p e r a t i n gl i f e ,o ft h eo r d e ro fm a g n i t u d eo fh u n d r e d so ft h o u s a n d so f cycles without degradation of performance [ 25].

What does the variable 'f' represent in the equation related to plunger-type magnets?,"505 ×10 - 6is applicable to round, flat-faced, plunger-type magnets), f is a leakage factor of the magnetic flux, whose value is less than unity and depends on the magnetic circuit, Pis a factor comprising constants and the permeability of the fluid in the gap G(m) between the core and the armature (a value P=1."
What should be considered in designing the resistance of a conductor for a solenoid valve coil?,"255 × 5.10 Design of Pilot Valves 507 10 - 6applies to an air gap), Nis the number of coil turns, and i(A) is the electric current applied to the coil. The radiating surface of a solenoid valve should be suf ficiently large to prevent an overheating of the coil. For this purpose, the resistance of the conductor should be designed according to the maximum allowable temperature."
Why is it essential to cover the plunger's face with non-magnetic material when the solenoid valve is powered off?," It is necessary to use appropriate seals in order to prevent the propellants from contaminating the coil. When the plunger of a solenoid valve is designed to be in contact with the core in the absence of electric power, then it is also necessary to cover the face of the plunger with a layer of non-magnetic material to avoid sticking [ 3]."
What is the electric resistance of the coil if the supply voltage is 28 V and the maximum current is 2 A?," As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to determine the electric resistance of the coil for a solenoid valve to be used in a rocket engine. The following data are known: the required actuating force at the start of the stroke isF=120.1 N, the electric supply has a voltage of 28 V direct current, the maximum current is imax=2A ,t h ea i rg a pb e t w e e nt h es o l e n o i dc o r ea n dt h ep l u n g e ro ft h e valve is G=0."

What is the resistance per meter for copper wire AWG No. 26 at a temperature of 293 K?,"4=1421 The resistance of the conductor used for the coil is R=V i=28 1.4=20/Omega1 We use a copper wire AWG No. 26 for the coil. In [ 33], we find the following data, at a temperature T=293 K, for this wire: diameter d=0.4049 mm, area A= ¼πd2=0.1288 mm2,a n dr e s i s t a n c ep e rm e t r e R=0.1336 /Omega1/m."
What is the average diameter of each turn for a wire of length 149.7 m with 1421 turns?," In order for the coil to have a resistance of 20 /Omega1,t h el e n g t h Lof the wire must be L=20 0.1336=149.7m Since the wire has N=1421 turns, then the average diameter Dof each turn results from D=L Nπ=149.7 1421 ×3.1416=0.03353 m The pilot valve described above is a two-way valve, which can be either fully open or fully closed."
What are the primary functions of multiple-passage valves in fluid systems?," Other pilot valves are multiple-passage valves, which can start, stop, and divert the motion of a fluid between three or more alternate paths. These valves are described below. Multiple-passage valves are used to control fluids moving to and from actuating cylinders. They are also used to control the direction of flow when it is necessary to switch or direct it between various paths."
What types of actuation methods can these valves utilize?," These valves are known as three-way valves, four-way valves, diversion valves, selection valves, sequence valves, and shuttle valves. Their method of actuation may be manual, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrical. They operate in two or more discrete positions, which change only when these valves are shifted."
What types of operation can the valve described perform?," Their mode of operation is only of the on-off type. Therefore, they cannot be used in proportional or throttling mode. The name three-way valve or four-way valve speci fies the number of ports in a valve. The following figure, re-drawn from [ 25], shows a three-way valve (designed by Valcor Engineering Corporation) of the poppet type, which is actuated by a solenoid."
What occurs to the cylinder port when the poppet is actuated towards the pressure port?," 5.10 Design of Pilot Valves 509 The valve illustrated above has a common port (the cylinder port), which can be connected to either one of two alternate ports (the pressure port and the reservoir port) when the non-connected port is closed. The poppet, when actuated in one direction, opens the cylinder port to the pressure port and closes it to the reservoir port."
What type of valve is utilized to manage a single-acting cylinder's flow direction?," The same poppet, when actuated in the other direction, opens the cylinder port to the reservoir port and closes it to the pressure port. The cylinder port of a three-way valve is used to control a single-acting cylinder. Af o u r - w a yv a l v ei sav a l v eh a v i n gf o u re x t e r n a lp o r t sa r r a n g e ds ot h a tt h e r ea r e two simultaneous flow paths in the valve."
What components are designated in a four-way valve used for a double-acting cylinder?," The ports of a four-way valve are identi fied as pressure port, reservoir port, and two cylinder ports. A four-way valve is used to actuate a double-acting cylinder. For this purpose, the valve is connected so that, when pressure is applied to one of the two cylinder ports, then the other cylinder port is connected to the reservoir, and vice versa."
"What is a characteristic feature of a three-position, four-way valve regarding its port configuration?"," Four-way valves are normally two-position or three-position valves. In a three-position, four-way valve, there is a central position in which all ports are closed. The following figure, re-drawn from [ 25], shows how multiple-passage valves can be used to control the position of a pneumatic piston-cylinder."
What type of valve is operated by a single-acting cylinder in the control system described?," 510 5 Control Systems and Valves The pilot stage valve (right) is a three-way, solenoid-operated, ball-type poppet valve. The main stage valve (centre) is a four-way, two position, ball-type poppet valve operated by means of a single-acting cylinder, which in turn is actuated by the pilot stage valve."
What happens to the work cylinder when current flows through the solenoid?," When the solenoid carries no current, then the actuation cylinder of the main stage is not connected with the pressure port, and the work cylinder (left) is in the down position. When the solenoid carries a current, then the actuation cylinder of the main stage is connected with the pressure port and therefore moves down, thereby connecting the upper end of the work cylinder with the reservoir port and the shaft end of the work cylinder with the pressure port, and therefore the work cylinder moves up."

What type of valve is illustrated in the example related to rocket engines?," Huzel and Huang [ 3]d e s c r i b et w oe x a m p l e so fm u l t i p l e - p a s s a g ev a l v e su s e df o r rocket engines. The first example concerns a pressure-actuated, three-way pilot valve, which may be used as an ignition monitor valve. This valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 3]."
What component in the valve prevents fluid leakage and acts as a pressure-sensing element?," 5.10 Design of Pilot Valves 511 The valve illustrated above is held normally closed by a spring, and has a diaphragm at its control port, which is connected to the thrust chamber injector fuel manifold. By the way, a diaphragm is a thin dividing membrane which is used as a seal to prevent fluid leakage and also as a pressure-sensing element having small (less than 1."
What triggers the ignition monitor valve to open during the engine start process?,"5 mm) displacements. During engine start and when a satisfactory igni- tion has been achieved in the main thrust chamber, the increase in pressure sensed at the thrust chamber injector fuel manifold causes the ignition monitor valve to open, because the diaphragm of the valve is put under pressure. This opening, in turn, directs the fuel pressure to the cylinder port connected to the main fuel valve actu- ator opening port."
How does the ignition monitor valve function during engine cut-off in relation to fuel pressure?," The valve spring can be calibrated to correspond to the effective area of the diaphragm, so that the valve opens at a preset sensed pressure. During engine cut-off, the decreasing pressure of the fuel causes the ignition monitor valve to close. This closure, in turn, vents the opening side of the main fuel valve actuator, thereby closing the valve."
How is the diaphragm's effective area determined in the context provided?," The poppet of the valve is balanced by the internal pressure of the fluid which acts on a dynamic O-ring seal having the same diameter ds(m) as the poppet. The valve diaphragm is made of a several layers of thin Mylar®sheets, which are pressure- formed with heat added. The effective area of the diaphragm can be determined experimentally."
"What is the formula to estimate the required preload of the valve spring in relation to diaphragm diameter, threshold pressure, and static friction force?"," The required preload of the valve spring may be estimated as follows 1 4πd2 dps=Ff+Sp where dd(m) is the effective diameter of the diaphragm, ps(N/m2)i st h er a t e ds e n s e d threshold pressure to open the valve, Ff(N) is the static friction force of the valve poppet, and Sp(N) is the required preload of the valve spring."
What is the characteristic flow area of the ignition monitor valve when it is in the fully open position?," For example, we want to determine the required preload Sp(N) and the output power P(W) for a pressure-actuated, three-way ignition monitor valve of the type 512 5 Control Systems and Valves described above, which has the following properties: characteristic flow area of the valve at the fully open position Ac=1."
What is the sensed threshold pressure needed to open the valve?,"226 ×10 - 4m2,d i a m e t e ro ft h ed i a p h r a g m dd =0.05334 m, sensed threshold pressure to open the valve ps=1.379 ×105N/m2, static friction force of the poppet Ff=62.28 N, resistance coef ficient at the fully open position k=3.5, required volume flow rate q=0.003277 m3/s, fuel pressure at the inlet port pf=2."
"What is the calculated value of Sp given dd, ps, Ff, and the area factors provided?","413 ×106N/m2.F r o m[ 34], we also know the density of the fuel (RP-1) to be rho =824 kg/m3at a temperature of 283 K.

What is the output power of the valve based on the pressure at discharge and volume flow rate?,"003277 1.226×10 - 4=26.73 m/s The pressure loss through the valve in the design conditions is ∆p=k⎦parenleftbigg1 2 rho v2⎦parenrightbigg =3.5×0.5×824×26.732=1.03×106N/m2 The pressure of the fuel at the point of discharge of the valve is pd=2.413×106 - 1.03×106=1.383×106N/m2 The output power of the valve results from the product of the pressure of the fluid at the point of discharge by the volume flow rate, as follows P=pdq=1."
What forces maintain the closed position of the port at cylinder 1 in the four-way pilot valve?,"383×106×0.003277 =4531 W The second example concerns a four-way pilot valve of the self-locking type. A scheme of this valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 3]. 5.10 Design of Pilot Valves 513 The valve illustrated above is held normally closed at the cylinder 1 port by two springs s1ands2."
What force maintains the valve in the open position after the actuating pressure is removed?,"T h ea c t u a t i n gp r e s s u r e pais applied to the inlet port (opening) of the valve. The pressure pacauses the translating shaft to move, and consequently the pressure port is connected to the cylinder 1 port, and the cylinder 2 port is connected to the return port. An unbalanced self-locking force ¼ π(d2 3–d2 1)piacts in the opening direction and causes the valve to remain open, even after the actuating pressure pa is removed from the opening port."
"What is the required formula to determine the diameters d2, d3, and d4 for the four-way pilot valve?"," The valve can be closed only by applying the actuating pressure pato the inlet port (closing) and venting the inlet port (opening). As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to determine the diameters d2,d3,a n d d4for the four-way pilot valve shown in the preceding figure, with a contingency factor c=1."
"Calculate the effective force on the poppet, considering preload forces and static friction.","5, knowing the following data: pre-load F1 =155.7 N and elastic constant k1=3.678 ×104N/m of the spring s1,p r e - l o a d F2 =111.2 N and elastic constant k2=4.378 ×104N/m of the spring s2,s t a t i cf r i c t i o n Ff=106.8 N of the poppet, relative pressure pi=2.758 ×106N/m2at the pressure port, relative pressure pa=1."

What happens to the velocity and pressure of a fluid when it flows through a nozzle or orifice?," According to the principle of Bernoulli, a fluid moving through a nozzle or an ori fice increases its velocity and decreases its pressure in the direction of flow. These devices can be used in liquid-propellant rocket engines as flow regulators, as will be shown below. Typical shapes used for nozzles and ori fices are shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 35]."

What component directly controls fluid pressure in a nozzle-flapper type servo-valve?," There are two principal types of servo-valves. In a servo-valve of the nozzle- flapper type, the pressure exerted by the fluid on the actuator is controlled directly by a fl a p p e r ,w h i c hr e s t r i c t st h e fl o wt h r o u g ht w on o z z l e so fv a r i a b l es i z e ,i nr e s p o n s et o an electrical input signal applied to a torque motor."
What determines the position of the sliding spool in a spool-type servo-valve?," In a servo-valve of the spool type, the pressure is controlled indirectly, by means of a sliding spool, whose position in the body of the valve depends on the angular position of the flapper. A spool is a solid cylindrical element having two or more recesses which fits closely in the bore of the valve body, such that the valve opens or closes by translating the spool within the bore."
What type of motion does the spool in a servo-valve utilize to control flow?," In other words, a servo-valve of the spool type is an electro-hydraulic valve having a spool, whose position in the valve body changes proportionally to an electrical input signal received by the valve. The translational motion of the spool in the valve is obtained by hydraulic pressure, and changes the size of two ori fices in order for the valve to control flow."
What component in a spool-type servo-valve converts an electrical signal into mechanical force?," The control exerted by the valve depends on the difference of hydraulic pressure across the ori fices, unless some form of compensation is used. A functional scheme of a servo-valve of the spool type is given in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 42]. 5.12 Design of Servo-Valves 521 The principal components of the servo-valve shown above are: •an electromagnetic torque motor, which acts as a transducer to convert an electrical input signal into a mechanical force; •a fl a p p e rd r i v e nb yt h em e c h a n i c a lf o r c eg e n e r a t e db yt h et o r q u em o t o r ,w h i c h restricts differentially the flow from a pair of nozzles, the flapper stroke being about 0."
What is the stroke length of the spool in millimeters when in motion?,"1 mm; •as p o o l ,w h o s et r a n s l a t i o n a lm o t i o nw i t h i nt h ev a l v eb o d yi sd u et ot h ed i f f e r e n c e of hydraulic pressure when the flapper is off-centre; and •af e e d b a c ks p r i n g ,w h i c ha l l o w st h es p o o lt om o v e ,t h es t r o k eo ft h es p o o lb e i n g about 1 mm, until the restoring force acting on the flapper is in equilibrium with the force generated by the torque motor."
What is the position of the flapper when there is no electrical signal applied to the torque motor?," The direction and the magnitude of the displacement of the flapper caused by the torque motor depend on the input signal. The flapper is located between two opposed nozzles, and therefore its motion in one or in the other direction restricts the flow through one or the other of these nozzles. When no electrical signal is applied to the torque motor, then the flapper is located at an equal distance between the two nozzles (neutral position)."
What components are included in the first stage of a servo-valve?," The presence of an electrical signal causes the flapper to move toward one or the other nozzle, thereby producing an unbalance of hydraulic pressure across the spool. The set of components comprising the torque motor, the nozzles, and the flapper is known as the first stage of a servo-valve. The first stage pilots the second stage, which comprises the spool and the feedback spring."
How does the position of the flapper affect the spool's displacement in response to an input signal?," The spring makes the displacement of the spool proportional to the difference of pressure caused by the off-centre position of the flapper in the first stage. The position of the flapper, in turn, depends on the force generated by the torque motor in response to the input signal. 522 5 Control Systems and Valves Therefore, the direction and the magnitude of the displacement of the spool are proportional to the direction and to the magnitude of the input signal, and are used to control the direction and the magnitude of flow to the actuator through the pressure at the cylinder ports of the valve."
What happens to the pressure upstream of the right nozzle circuit when the flapper moves to the right?," For example, with reference to the preceding figure, an electrical signal resulting in a displacement of the flapper to the right restricts the flow from the nozzle on the right hand side. This restriction increases the pressure upstream of the right nozzle circuit, and decreases the pressure upstream of the left circuit."
What causes the spool to shift and how does this affect fluid flow in the system?," This unbalance of pressure causes the spool to shift to the left, until the difference of pressure is balanced by the pressure exerted by the spring on the spool. The shift of the spool to the left opens a flow path from the pressure port placed on the left to the cylinder port A, and the returning fluid through the cylinder port B moves through the return line to the reservoir."
What is the approximate range of hydraulic power that a servo-valve can amplify from 0.1 W of electrical input?," A servo-valve is not only an electrical-to- hydraulic transducer, but also a power ampli fier, because the electrical input power, whose order of magnitude is about 0.1 W, is ampli fied in the first stage to at least 10 W of hydraulic power, and then used to control, by means of the spool, an amount of about 10 kW of hydraulic power."
What is the power amplification factor of a two-stage servo-valve?," Therefore, the power ampli fication factor in a two-stage servo-valve is 105[42]. Another two-stage servo-valve of the spool type is illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 25]. In the servo-valve shown below, the spool is spring- loaded, in order for its position in the valve to be proportional to the input received from the first stage."
What components are utilized to prevent small particles from obstructing orifices and nozzles in the servo-valve system?," The spool is centred by helical coil springs on each side. Inte- gral filters are used to remove small particles, which would otherwise coalesce and obstruct ori fices and nozzles. These filters are also used to protect the spool from contaminants. This servo-valve has also a drain bleed system to protect the torque motor from leakage fluid."
What is the function of the servo-valves in the main engines of the Space Shuttle?," 5.12 Design of Servo-Valves 523 In the main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, two servo-valves (channel A and channel B) are mounted on each of the five actuators. These servo-valves convert the electrical command signal from the engine controller (described in Sect. 5.2) to hydraulic flow directed to the valve actuator."
What do the two servo-valves ensure regarding the performance of the actuators during a malfunction?," They convert the polarity and the amplitude of the electrical command signal into respectively the rotation direction and the rotation rate of the shaft. The two servo-valves are redundant, in order for the failure of one of them not to affect the performance of the actuators. An assembly of one of these servo-valves is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 7]."
What happens to flow at one nozzle when the torque motor of the servo-valve tilts due to the input signal?," When the torque motor of the servo-valve tilts in response to the polarity and to the amplitude of the input signal, the flow restriction is increased at one nozzle, and decreased at the other. These variable restrictors are paired with constant restrictors at the end of the filter, forming two matched pressure dividers."
What happens to the spool’s offset when the torque motor tilts in one direction?," Therefore, the pressures applied to the ends of the spool in the second stage can be varied, being equal in the null position and not equal otherwise. 524 5 Control Systems and Valves The resulting offset of the spool is opposite to the tilt of the torque motor, and is fed back to the torque motor via the springy connecting rod, thereby assuring proportional control."
What effect does the spool offset have on the pressure levels at the ports in a hydraulic system?," The spool offset in effect simultaneously moves one port toward the input (higher) pressure, and the other port toward the return (lower) pressure, driving the pistons. Therefore, the polarity of the signal determines the direction of rotation, and the amplitude of the signal determines the rotation rate in the valve [ 7]."
Which equations are applicable for designing flapper-nozzle type servo-valves when dealing with liquid substances?," The equations which can be used for the design of servo-valves of the flapper- nozzle type are those shown in Sect. 5.11for the flow of liquid or gaseous substances through nozzles or ori fices. These equations are re-written below for convenience of the reader. In case of liquid substances, the following equation can be used ."

What is the primary function of a pressure regulator in a control valve?,"221×106 - 2.961×106=0.26×106N/m2 5.13 Design of Pressure-Reducing Regulators In general terms, a pressure regulator is a control valve which has no auxiliary source of power during operation. The pressure is controlled by varying the flow in the valve as a function of the sensed difference between the actual value and the desired value of pressure."
What is the function of a pressure regulator in the aerospace field?," Any unbalanced force resulting from this difference of pressure moves am e t e r i n ge l e m e n t ,w h i c hi n c r e a s e so rd e c r e a s e s fl o wt or e d u c et h ep r e s s u r ee r r o r to zero [ 25]. However, in the aerospace field, the name of pressure regulator indicates any device which maintains a desired value of upstream, downstream, or differential pressure by means of a pressure-reducing control element."
What equipment is employed to ensure a steady pneumatic pressure in a tank for liquid propellant storage?," For example, pressure regulators are used to maintain a constant pneumatic pressure in a tank for the storage of liquid propellants. In a pump-fed rocket engine, this constant pressure is used to protect the structure of the tank and to meet the requirements of pump suction head. Af u r t h e rp r o t e c t i o ni sp r o v i d e dt ot h et a n kb yar e l i e fv a l v e ."
How do pressure variations in pneumatic control systems influence valve operations during engine starting and shutting down?," In control systems of large rocket engines, pressure regulators maintain the pres- sure of gas at a constant value to operate engine control valves, main propellant valves, gas-generator valves, and other control components [ 43]. In pneumatic control systems, variations of regulated pressure affect valve timing and sequencing in engine start and shutdown operations."
What are the three categories of pressure regulators mentioned in reaction-control systems?," In reaction-control systems, the source of energy for propellant feed is supplied by gas stored at high pressure [43]. Pressure regulators can be classi fied into the following categories: •pressure-reducing regulators, which are used to reduce the pressure upstream of them to a desired downstream pressure, independently of variations of upstream pressure; •back pressure regulators, which measure and regulate the pressure upstream of them independently of variations of downstream pressure; and •differential pressure regulators, which maintain a constant difference of pressure across a restrictor of constant area, for example, across an ori fice, to maintain a constant desired value of flow rate."
What are the two classifications of pressure-reducing regulators mentioned?, The pressure regulators described in the present section are only those of the first type. The regulators of the other types (relief valves and differential pressure regulators) will be described in the following sections. Pressure-reducing regulators may be modulating or non-modulating. A regulator of the modulating type is a device which maintains a constant regulated pressure in at a n k .

What are the three principal components of directly-operated pressure-reducing regulators?," Modulating pressure-reducing regulators include, in turn, directly-operated, dome-loaded, and pilot-operated regulators. As c h e m eo fad i r e c t l y - o p e r a t e dr e g u l a t o ri ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u e to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]. It consists of three principal elements: a sensing element (for example, a diaphragm), an inlet valve (comprising a movable element and a seat), and a source of reference load, which is usually a spring."
"What is the term for the combination of the sensing element, inlet valve, and stem in the described system?"," The reference load due to the spring acts on the sensing element in one direction, and the force due to the regulated pressure acts in the opposite direction. The combination comprising the sensing element, the inlet valve, and the stem, which connects the sensing element with the inlet valve, is called the metering element."
What term describes the force applied by the reference spring on the sensing component in a pressure regulation system?," The force exerted by the reference spring on the sensing element is called the load. The sensing element is also subject to the actual regulated pressure and compresses the reference spring, which is used to establish the desired pressure setting. The net force acting on the inlet valve controls the flow through the regulator."
What occurs to the outlet pressure when the movable element of the inlet valve is not balanced by pressure?," The movable element of the inlet valve may, or may not, be pressure-balanced. When the movable element is not pressure-balanced, then the inlet pressure acts on the main seat and changes the force equilibrium within the inlet valve. Consequently, al o s so fi n l e tp r e s s u r ea c r o s st h em a i ns e a tr e s u l t si na ni n c r e a s ei no u t l e tp r e s s u r e ."
What component is adjusted using a screw to change the set point in a direct-acting regulator?," When the movable element is pressure-balanced, then there is no variation of outlet pressure resulting from changes of inlet pressure. A regulator having a pressure- balanced movable element requires a dynamic seal to pressure-balance the main seat of the inlet valve. The set point of a direct-acting regulator can be adjusted by means of a screw (not shown in the figure) which lifts or lowers a plate located above the reference 534 5 Control Systems and Valves spring, in order to extend or compress the spring."
What is required for precise control with minimal outlet pressure variations?," To a low value of the constant of the reference spring there corresponds a high value of the stroke of the movable element of the inlet valve which it is possible to achieve. When a highly accurate regulation with small changes of outlet pressure is desired, then a large area of the sensing element is needed to achieve a high driving force."
What impact does a higher number of coils in springs have on the size and mass of a regulator?," Therefore, a high force due to the reference spring is needed. Since a low value of the spring constant is desired, then it is necessary to use springs having a high number of coils. This, in turn, increases the size and the mass of the regulator. The principal disadvantage of a spring-loaded regulator is that any change in the spring length during the regulation cycle changes the load and the set point of the regulator."
How can the negative effects associated with a high spring constant be mitigated?," This undesirable effect can be counteracted by using a spring having low value of spring constant, or by decreasing the stroke of the movable element [ 25]. Ad o m e - l o a d e dr e g u l a t o ri sar e g u l a t o ri nw h i c ht h es o u r c eo fr e f e r e n c el o a d is a force obtained by pressurising the dome above the sensing element with gas."
"What is the source of load in a dome-loaded regulator, if not a spring?"," As c h e m eo fad o m e - l o a d e dr e g u l a t o ri ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et ot h e courtesy of NASA [ 43]. The source of load in a regulator of the dome-loaded type is not a spring. It is the reference pressure which a pilot gas exerts on the dome above the sensing element."
What component regulates the inlet valve's operation based on the pilot gas pressure and diaphragm stroke?," The pilot gas, which may be the same as the gas whose pressure is to be regulated, is supplied to the dome through a small loader valve. The loader valve reduces the supply pressure to the desired reference pressure. The excess of pilot gas is directed to a vent side through an ori fice. The poppet of the inlet valve is opened or closed by the pressure of the pilot gas and by the stroke of the diaphragm, which depends on the chosen pressure."
What type of regulator uses a small actuation force to manage a larger flow?," Ap i l o t - o p e r a t e dr e g u l a t o ri sas m a l l fl o wc o n t r o ld e v i c eo p e r a t e db yas m a l l actuation force which controls indirectly a large flow requiring a large actuation force. A scheme of a pilot-operated regulator is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]."
What components are primarily involved in an on-modulating regulator for pressure control?," 5.13 Design of Pressure-Reducing Regulators 535 An o n - m o d u l a t i n gr e g u l a t o rc o n s i s t sp r i n c i p a l l yo fap r e s s u r es w i t c ha n da no n - off solenoid valve. The pressure switch senses the pressure in a tank, and the on-off valve controls the flow of a pressurising gas to the tank."
What component opens the solenoid valve when the pressure in the tank drops below a specified level?," A pressure transducer with an amplifying circuit may be used instead of the pressure switch. When the pressure in the tank decreases below the minimum desired value, the electrical contacts of the pressure switch close, and an electrical signal opens the solenoid valve. This causes the pressurising gas to flow to the tank to increase the pressure in the tank."
What occurs when the pressure switch contacts open in relation to the solenoid valve and gas flow?," As the pressure in the tank approaches the desired maximum value, the contacts of the pressure switch open, the solenoid valve is not fed by current, and the flow of the pressurising gas stops. Therefore, the pressure in the tank oscillates between am i n i m u mv a l u ea n dam a x i m u mv a l u e ."
What can cause a failure in a pressurisation system using a regulator reliant on an external energy source?,"S i n c et h i sr e g u l a t o rr e q u i r e sa ne x t e r n a l source of energy, then a failure of this source of energy or of any of its components can cause a failure of a system of pressurisation using the regulator [ 43]. Another example of non-modulating regulator is the device developed by the Frebank Company."
What type of valve operates to maintain tank pressure in a missile by opening at a lower set point?," This regulator is a single stage, pilot operated valve meant to control the pressure in the tank of a missile. The metering valve is closed until the pressure in the tank falls below the lower set point. When this happens, the metering 536 5 Control Systems and Valves valve of the regulator opens to full flow until the pressure in the tank reaches the upper set point, at which time the valve closes."
What defines the dead-band in a non-modulating regulator?," A scheme of this valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 25]. The dead-band of a non-modulating regulator is the pressure range between the upper set point and the lower set point. In the regulator shown in the preceding figure, the two set points are determined by the pre-de flection point and the post-de flection point, which limit the travel of the Belleville springs."
What components determine the pre-de flection and post-de flection points in the provided mechanism?," The pre-de flection point is determined by the adjustment ring, and the post-de flection point is determined by the stop. The regulated pressure exerts a force on the sensing diaphragm through the sensing port. The force acting on the diaphragm is transmitted by the diaphragm assembly to the Belleville springs."
What component maintains the pin's position against the stop when no pressure is applied?," In the absence of pressure, no force acts on the diaphragm. In this condition, the actuator assembly (comprising the diaphragm and the Belleville springs) holds the head of the pin against the pre-de flection travel stop, and causes the pilot valve to be fully open. The adjustment ring provides the pre-de flection adjustment."
What effect does the pressure difference across the orifice have on the pressure in the chamber behind the poppet?," Gas at high pressure, introduced into the inlet port, flows through an ori fice, through the open pilot valve, and into the sense chamber through the flow passage. When the pilot valve is open, the pressure difference across the ori fice causes the pressure in the chamber behind the poppet of the main valve to decrease, thereby creating a pressure difference across the poppet."
What happens to the actuator assembly when the pressure in the tank reaches the pre-deflection setting of the Belleville springs?," This pressure difference creates a force unbalance, and the poppet opens until it bottoms on the shank of the seat of the pilot valve. Now, the gas flows directly through the main valve into the ullage space. When the pressure in the tank reaches the value corresponding 5.13 Design of Pressure-Reducing Regulators 537 to the pre-de flection setting of the Belleville springs, the actuator assembly snaps to the post-de flection stop."
What happens to the pressure in the chamber between the poppets when the pilot valve is closed?," Now, the pilot valve, which is no longer held open by the actuator assembly, is closed by the spring between the poppets. When the pilot valve is closed, the pressure increases in the chamber between the poppets, and reaches av a l u ew h e r et h ep o p p e to ft h em a i nv a l v ec l o s e s .T h ep r e s s u r ei nt h ec h a m b e r continues to increase, until it becomes equal to the inlet pressure, and then both poppets are held on their seats by the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet, and also by the spring force of the poppet."
What occurs in the regulator when both poppets are closed and the actuator assembly is at the post-deflection stop?," When the actuator assembly is at the post-de flection stop and both poppets are closed, the regulator is in lock-up. In this condition, any demand on the system decreases the pressure in the ullage space. As the pressure drops to a value of the post-de flection setting, the actuator assembly snaps to the pre-de flection point."
How is the characteristic flow area of the pressure regulator determined?," The pin moves the poppet of the pilot valve to the full open position, and the chamber between the poppets evacuates to create the pressure difference to cause the poppet of the main valve to open. This cycle is repeated to hold the regulated pressure in the dead-band [ 25]. For the pressure regulators described above, the characteristic flow area Ac(m2)o f the regulator, that is, the area of the valve in fully open position, can be determined as af u n c t i o no ft h er e q u i r e dm a s s fl o wr a t e ."

What types of devices can be utilized to measure flow in the main line along with static pressure taps?," The measurement can be performed by using a variable head flow-meter (for example, an ori fice, or a nozzle, or a Venturi tube) installed in the main line. The flow-meter has static pressure taps placed at two points along the fluid stream, as has been shown in Sect. 5.7,f o rt h eV e n t u r it u b e ."
How does the volume flow rate behave when the pressure drop across a flow-meter is constant?,"I nS e c t . 5.7,i th a sa l s ob e e ns h o w n how the volume flow rate depends on the pressure drop. When the pressure drop across a flow-meter is kept constant, then the volume flow rate will also be constant. The pressure drop is kept constant by using a pressure-reducing regulator. The static pressures are impressed to the fluid on opposite sides of the sensing element of the regulator."
How is the force from a spring employed in a direct-acting differential pressure regulator?," These pressures can be adjusted by means of a spring placed on one side of the sensing element. The force provided by the spring can be regulated so as to balance the lower value of static pressure against the upper value. The working principle of a direct-acting differential pressure regulator, designed by the W."
What function does the internal valve serve in maintaining the flow rate despite pressure variations?,"A. Kates Company, is illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 44]. 5.14 Design of Differential Pressure Regulators 539 In this regulator, the internal differential pressure regulating valve maintains a constant pressure drop across the adjustable metering ori fice to provide the set flow rate, independently of pressure variations which may occur upstream or downstream of the device."
What effect does an increase in upstream pressure have on the valve impeller position?," The supply pressure p1upstream of the valve is balanced by the pressure p2within the valve plus the force provided by the spring. When the pressure p1upstream of the regulator increases above the desired pressure drop, then the instantaneous imbalance of pressure moves the impeller downward. This movement restricts the valve ports and therefore increases the ori fice back-pressure p2,s oa st o restore the difference of pressure and the flow rate at the previous settings."
How do relief valves manage fluid pressure within a tank when it exceeds allowed limits?," The valve works oppositely in case of an increase in the outlet pressure p3.Ad i r e c t - a c t i n g differential pressure regulator, designed by the W.A. Kates Company, is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 25]. 540 5 Control Systems and Valves 5.15 Design of Relief Valves Relief valves are devices which measure and regulate the pressure of a fluid in a tank by discharging fluid above the permitted limits to another tank, where the pressure is lower."
What is the primary function of safety valves in pneumatic systems?," They open automatically when a pre-set level of pressure is reached in the tank under control, and are used primarily in hydraulic systems. Safety valves are partic- ular relief valves which control the pressure in pneumatic systems by discharging the excessive gas or vapour to the atmosphere. In aerospace airborne systems, relief valves are used for both liquid and gaseous substances, and differ one from another depending on the fluids for which they are 5."
What distinguishes relief valves from other types of valves in terms of flow operation?,"15 Design of Relief Valves 541 used. For example, there are relief valves for liquid oxygen, and relief valves for gaseous helium. The fluid in excess is discharged overboard. An excess of pressure can occur in a tank due to thermal changes or to leaking valves. Relief valves differ from other valves, because their operation creates a high pressure drop during flow [ 43]."
What components are included in a relief valve according to the description provided?," Ar e l i e fv a l v ec o n s i s t so fav a l v eb o d y ,as o u r c eo fr e f e r e n c el o a d( s u c ha sa spring), and a control element (such as a poppet) which matches with a seat. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43], shows a modulating (left) and a non-modulating (right) directly-operated relief valve."
What role does the reference load from the spring play in the operation of a direct-operating relief valve?," In a direct-operating relief valve, the reference load due to the spring is applied at all times to the control element. The reference load acts on the control element against the pressure in the tank or in the circuit under control. The intensity of the load determines the set point of the relief pressure."
What occurs to the control element when the tank's fluid pressure rises to match the reference load?," When the pressure of the fluid in the tank rises to the level necessary to balance the reference load, then the control element moves from the seat so as to discharge the fluid in excess to a reservoir of lower pressure placed downstream of the valve. Likewise, when the pressure of the fluid in the tank decreases below the set point, then the reference load acting against the pressure closes the valve."
What is the pressure level called at which leakage flow reaches a specified value for a valve?," Ar e l i e fv a l v eh a sg o o do p e r a t i n gc h a r a c t e r i s t i c sw h e nt h ep r e s s u r e pffor rated flow and the pressure prfor reseat closely approach the cracking pressure pc.T h e cracking pressure is the relief setting of the valve, that is, the pressure level at which the leakage flow reaches some speci fied value."
What is the relationship between cracking pressure and allowable working pressure of a tank?," The cracking pressure is always less than the allowable working pressure of the tank, and is usually less than 110% of the normal operating pressure. The rated flow is usually established for pressures 10% greater than the pressure setting of the relief valve. The reseat pressure is less than the cracking pressure, by an amount depending on the con figuration of the closure (control element and seat)."
What is the common reseat pressure expressed as a percentage of the cracking pressure?," A reseat pressure of 95% of the cracking pressure is a common value [ 25]. Ar e l i e fv a l v em a yb en o to n l yd i r e c t l y - o p e r a t e d ,a ss h o w ni nt h ep r e c e d i n g fi g u r e , but also inversely-operated or pilot-operated. The following figure, due to the cour- tesy of NASA [ 43], shows an inversely-operated (left) and a pilot-operated (right) relief valve."
How does the reference load affect the performance of an inversely-operated relief valve in relation to pressure changes?," 542 5 Control Systems and Valves In an inversely-operated relief valve, the reference load holding the poppet on the seat increases with increasing pressure. The diaphragm senses the increasing pressure in the tank and, at some value of pressure, strokes the hanger which comes in contact with the poppet and reduces the closing force applied to the poppet."
What is the relationship between the forces applied to the poppet and the valve's status regarding cracking pressure?," When the forces applied to the poppet are equal, then the valve is at the cracking pressure. The bias spring applies a load to the poppet to place it in the initial position at low- pressure sealing [ 43]. It is desirable that the force which holds the poppet on the seat at a speci fied pressure pt(where ptis less than the cracking pressure pc)s h o u l db ea s great as possible."
What happens to the effective diameter of the diaphragm as the maximum closing pressure nears the cracking pressure?," For this purpose, the effective area Adof the diaphragm is larger than the unbalanced seat area As, as follows Ad≈pc pc - ptAs The effective diameter of the diaphragm becomes increasingly larger than the diameter of the seat when the maximum closing pressure approaches the cracking pressure. Ap i l o t - o p e r a t e dr e l i e fv a l v ei su s e dw h e ni ti sn e c e s s a r yt oc o n t r o ll a r g e fl o w s ."
What happens to the actuator control-pressure when the inlet pressure reaches the cracking value?," When this valve is in the non-relieving conditions, the control pressure of the actuator is at the level of the inlet pressure, and the resulting force holds the main poppet in the position of closure. When the inlet pressure increases so as to reach the cracking value, the pilot valve partially strokes, the control pressure of the actuator is ported to the outlet cavity, the pressure in the actuator control-pressure is reduced so much that the resulting force is zero, and the main poppet is ready to open."
What happens to the main poppet when the inlet pressure rises?," As the inlet pressure continues to increase, the pilot valve stroke increases, the pressure in the control-pressure cavity decreases, and the resulting force opens the main poppet [ 43]. In airborne applications, lightweight materials, such as aluminium, are used for the valve body. The source of reference load is a force acting against an increase in pressure on the control element until the set point of pressure relief is reached."
What shapes can the seat of a closure unit have in relief valve design?," The most common element used for this purpose is a compressed spring. 5.15 Design of Relief Valves 543 The closure unit comprises a seat and a control element. The seat may have a flat, or spherical, or conical shape. The control element may be a ball, or a poppet (which in turn may be conical or V-shaped), or a piston."
What forces are responsible for keeping the main and pilot valves closed in the pilot-operated relief valve?," Another type of pilot-operated relief valve, used to protect propellant tanks from overpressure, has been described by Huzel and Huang [ 3]. A scheme of this valve is illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 3]. Both the main valve and the pilot valve are normally held closed by the spring forces FsmandFs3and by the control pressure pc."
What triggers the actuation of the pilot valve in the control system?,"T h ec o n t r o l l e ro ft h ep i l o tv a l v es e n s e st h ep r e s s u r e ptin the tank. When the pressure in the tank reaches or exceeds the preset level, the pilot valve is actuated to crack. This vents the actuator control pressure pcof the main relief valve and in turn permits the main valve to open."
What factors influence the positioning of the poppet in the main valve?," The position of the poppet of the main valve depends on the control pressure pc,w h i c hi nt u r ni sc o n t r o l l e db yt h ep o s i t i o n of the poppet of the pilot valve and by the pressure ptin the tank.

What is the formula for the area of the cross section of the sensor bellows in square meters?,"138 ×106N/m2is the set point for the absolute pressure of relief in the tank, pa=1.031 ×105N/m2is the ambient (atmospheric) pressure, Ab=¼πd2 b (m2)i st h ea r e ao ft h ec r o s ss e c t i o no ft h es e n s o rb e l l o w s , Fb(N) is the force due to the sensor bellows, Fs1(N) and Fs2(N) are the forces due to the springs acting on the sensor bellows, and Fa(N) is the actuating force of the pilot valve."
What condition must be met for the pilot valve to initiate its opening?," The pilot valve starts to open when Fa>Fp. 5.16 Design of Check Valves Ac h e c kv a l v ei sad e v i c ew h i c hp r e v e n t sam o v i n g fl u i df r o mr e v e r s i n gi t sd i r e c t i o n of motion. A check valve allows a fluid to move freely in one direction, and stops the motion in case of a pressure reversal."
What must be done promptly to prevent overflow or overpressure during a flow reversal in a fluid?," A pressure reversal may occur in a fluid either normally or as a result of a failure. In the latter case, a flow reversal must be promptly stopped, in order to avoid an over flow or an overpressure in a tank, or an unwanted combination of reactive fluids, or other damages to components of a rocket engine."
What ensures the independent operation of a spring-loaded movable element in check valves for aerospace vehicles?," Ac h e c kv a l v eo p e r a t e sa u t o m a t i c a l l y ,b e c a u s ei t sm o v a b l ee l e m e n ti sa c t u a t e db y the forces exerted by the moving fluid. In case of aerospace vehicles, the movable element of a check valve is spring-loaded, in order for the valve to be operated independently of either the gravitational force or the attitude of the vehicle."
What characteristics must be considered when selecting a specific type of non-actuated valve according to Howell and Weathers?, A check valve requires neither an actuation signal nor a source of power for its operation. Howell and Weathers [ 25]h a v ei d e n t i fi e ds o m ec r i t e r i at ob ec o n s i d e r e di nt h ed e s i g n and in the choice of a particular type of check valve. These criteria are brie fly indicated below.
What factors influence the rise in pressure drop across a check valve in aerospace applications?," The first of them concerns the pressure drop across a check valve. In valves used for aerospace applications, it is desirable to keep the increase in pressure drop with increasing volume flow rate as low as possible. The increase in pressure drop in a valve depends on the type (sphere or cone frustum or poppet having another shape) of its closing element."
What factors influence the sealing properties of a check valve?," Another criterion concerns the type of seal used in a check valve. This is because the sealing properties of a check valve depend on the sealing material, on the initial 5.16 Design of Check Valves 549 load of the spring, and on the difference of pressure across the closing element of the valve. In case of a pressure reversal, a check valve leaks until the back pressure acting on it becomes as high as to provide a suf ficient seating force."
What must be high to prevent leakage when the reversal pressure is negligible?," In order for the valve not to leak when the reversal pressure is null or very low, the initial load of the spring must be high, which fact implies a high value of pressure drop when the controlled fluid moves in its normal direction. The use of elastic materials for the seat makes it possible to reduce leakage at low values of the seating load."
What is the minimum pressure required to ensure a specified flow rate in a valve?," Another criterion concerns the cracking and the reseating pressures of a check valve. As has been shown in Sect. 5.15,t h ec r a c k i n gp r e s s u r eo fav a l v ei st h e minimum pressure which assures a given value of flow rate. The reseating pressure of a valve is the reverse differential pressure needed to keep leakage at or below a given value."
What factors influence the cracking and reseating pressures of a check valve?," A proper choice of the spring loading and of the seating properties can reduce the reseating pressure. The cracking and the reseating pressures of a check valve depend on its pressure drop and on its leakage properties. Another criterion concerns the type of fluid moving through a check valve. The materials (including metals, seals, and coatings) of which a valve is made must be compatible with the fluid controlled by the valve."
What must be considered when selecting materials for a check valve used with gases?," In particular, the choice of the materials depends on whether the fluid is a liquid or a gas. In the latter case, special care must be taken with gases of low molar mass, such as hydrogen and helium. Another criterion concerns the operating pressure of a check valve. The body of av a l v em u s tb ed e s i g n e df o rt h em a x i m u mp r e s s u r et ow h i c ht h ev a l v ei ss u b j e c t ."
What phenomenon can occur in a valve due to rapid closure that results in increased pressure levels?," In particular, when a valve is rapidly closed, a water hammer can arise in the valve. This phenomenon increases the level of pressure several times the normal operating pressure. When a valve is subject to a large number of pressure cycles, a failure due to fatigue must be taken into account. Another criterion concerns the temperature at which the fluid and the valve operate."
What is essential for the materials used in valve seals to endure in their operating environment?," Special care must be taken of the non-metallic materials which are used for the seals. All materials used in a valve must be designed to withstand the worst thermal conditions in their operating environment. Since the mass of the valve acts as a heat sink, short-term excursions of temperature beyond the recommended limits are tolerable."
What issues can arise from temperature variations in materials due to their differing thermal expansion properties?," Particular attention should be given to temperature gradients, which can give rise to binding effects due to the different coef ficients of thermal expansion of the materials. Another criterion concerns the sensitivity of either the fluid system or the fluid itself to contamination. Contamination can cause malfunction or internal leakage in av a l v e ."
What should be minimized in the maintenance requirements for a valve to reduce operational challenges?,"S p e c i a lc a r em u s tb et a k e no ft h ev a l v eb o d ya n do ft h es e a l s . Another criterion concerns the operations of maintenance required by a valve. The maintenance requirements should be reduced as far as possible, and the need to use special tools should be avoided. Seals requiring periodic replacement should be readily available and easily accessible."
What is the relationship between the mass of a ball in a check valve and its radius?," Care must be taken to avoid contamination during disassembly and service. Another criterion concerns the mass and the size of a valve, which are aspects of primary importance in valves used for aerospace applications. For example, in a check valve of the ball type, the mass of the ball is proportional the cube of its radius; by contrast, in a check valve of the flapper type, the mass of the closing element is 550 5 Control Systems and Valves nearly proportional to the square of its linear size."
What types of check valves are preferred when the ball radius exceeds 1 cm?," Therefore, check valves of the ball type are rarely used when the radius of the ball exceeds 1 cm. In this case, flapper-type or swing-type check valves are used. Another aspect concerns the cost of a check valve. The cost depends on such factors as operating pressure, temperature, flow rate, leakage requirements, type of fluid, mass, reliability, and life-cycle requirements."
What factors influence the operating life of check valves in aerospace applications?," In case of check valves used for aerospace applications, performance and reliability are factors of primary importance. Another criterion concerns the operating life of a check valve. The operating life depends on such factors as type of fluid, contamination, operating temperature, stresses, number of cycles, type of seals, materials of construction, and procedures of maintenance."
What are the two categories of check valves as classified by Tomlinson and Keller?," In order to increase the operating life of a valve, loads and stresses acting on the valve components should be reduced as far as possible. However, valves to be used for aerospace applications should not be over-designed for their life-cycle requirements. According to Tomlinson and Keller [ 43], check valves can be classi fied in two categories: poppet valves and flapper valves."
What mechanism forces the poppet against the seat in the valve body?," Three different valves (ball, cone, and floating ring) of the poppet type are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]. Ac h e c kv a l v eo ft h ep o p p e tt y p eh a sap o p p e ta si t sc l o s i n ge l e m e n t .T h i sp o p p e t translates axially in the valve body and a compressed spring of the coil type forces the poppet against the seat."
What is the range of cracking pressure for valves with low leakage and low pressure drop?," Valves of this type are used in applications requiring low leakage in the direction of the checked flow and low pressure drop in the direction of the free flow. The cracking pressure is low (in the range going from 21000 to 103000 N/m2,a c c o r d i n gt o[ 43], and the full- flow pressure is as close to the cracking 5."
How can the cracking pressure of a poppet-type check valve be increased?,"16 Design of Check Valves 551 pressure as possible. The cracking pressure of check valves of the poppet type can be increased by increasing the load of the return spring. In these conditions, a check valve can be used as a relief valve or a back-pressure regulator [ 43]. A check valve of the ball type is illustrated in the preceding figure."
What is the purpose of the soft seal in a valve with a hard ball closing element?," This valve has a hard ball as its closing element. The ball is spring-loaded against a circular, conical, or spherical seat. In order to reduce leakage, a soft seal is sometimes used. This soft seat is made of Te flon®,o ro fa n o t h e rp l a s t i co re l a s t o m e r i cm a t e r i a l .O t h e r w i s e ,ac o m b i n a t i o n of soft with hard materials is used for the seat."
What causes the ball in a check valve to experience turbulence and increased pressure drop?," The force due to the fluid stream lifts the ball off the seat against the load provided by the spring, and the flow passes around the ball. Since the flow must surround the ball, then a check valve of the ball type has a tendency toward turbulence and a higher pressure drop than other types of check valves."
"What issue occurs with a ball-type check valve when opened by low flow, related to the valve's seating mechanism?"," In normal operating conditions, the ball may rotate slightly on the return spring, thereby causing wear on the ball and on the seat. A check valve of the ball type is prone to chatter when opened by a low flow which does not fully stroke and hold the ball in the full-open position. By chatter we mean an uncontrolled seating and reseating of the closing element of a valve."
What is the primary advantage of using ball-type check valves in low-flow situations?," Check valves of the ball type are simple and cheap to manufacture, since the seat is the only costly detail. They are used in low- flow applications where the stroke is short and the ball will self-guide into the seat [ 43]. Ac h e c kv a l v eo ft h ec o n et y p ei sa ni m p r o v e m e n to ft h ev a l v eo ft h eb a l lt y p e described above."
What component is used to replace the ball in the described mechanism?," The improvement is obtained by guiding and aligning the closing element in a constant direction, in order for its contact with the seat to be continuous and even. For this purpose, the ball is replaced by a piston sliding in a hollow cylinder and having a conical seating surface at one end. This surface is spring-loaded to seat against a spherical or conical surface, which may be made of either a soft material or ah a r dm a t e r i a l ."
What factors can lead to leakage between the piston and its seating area in a valve system?,"Ac h e c kv a l v eo ft h ec o n et y p eh a sal o w e rp r e s s u r ed r o pt h a no n e of the ball type having the same size, and a lower tendency to chatter, because of the guided movement and the resultant damping of its closing element. The presence of contaminating particles in the seating area and between the piston and the body of the valve can cause sticking or cocking with consequent leakage between the piston and the seating area."
What shape is the poppet in the described valve mechanism?," Ac h e c kv a l v eo ft h e fl o a t i n g - r i n gt y p ei sa l s oav a l v eh a v i n gac l o s i n ge l e m e n t guided and aligned in a constant direction. It has a mushroom-shaped poppet, whose stem slides in the valve body and whose head seals through an O-ring against a circular flat or tapered seat."
What is the mechanism that allows fluid to flow through a valve featuring a poppet head?," The force due to the fluid stream causes the head of the poppet to move off the seat in the flow direction, and the fluid passes through the stem of the poppet, around the head of the poppet, and through the body of the valve. Ac h e c kv a l v eo ft h i st y p eh a sal o w e rp r e s s u r ed r o pa ta ne q u a l fl o wr a t et h a nab a l l or a cone check valve."
What is the purpose of damping chambers in a floating-ring valve?, Damping chambers may be incorporated in a floating-ring valve in order to eliminate chatter and hammering. The presence of contaminating particles between the poppet stem and the valve body can cause sticking and leakage. Ac h e c kv a l v eo ft h e fl o a t i n g - r i n gt y p eh a sm o r ec o m p o n e n t sa n dt h e r e f o r ei sm o r e costly than a ball or a cone check valve.
What are the two types of flapper check valves mentioned?," 552 5 Control Systems and Valves Two check valves of the flapper type, namely, a split- flapper (left) and a swing- flapper (right) valve, are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43]. Ac h e c kv a l v eo ft h e fl a p p e rt y p eh a sar o t a t i n g fl a p p e ra si t sc l o s i n ge l e m e n t ."
What type of springs are utilized in a flapper check valve to enable its operation?," The loaded spring acting on the flapper is of the torsion type, and the flapper may be either a split element which pivots across the centre of the flow path or a single element which pivots from the side. Flapper check valves are used in applications requiring low pressure drop with large flow rates."
What is a characteristic of flapper check valves when exposed to high pressure?," They are often smaller and lighter than those of the poppet type. However, when subject to high pressures, flapper check valves may become excessively heavy [ 43]. As w i n g - fl a p p e rc h e c kv a l v eh a sah i n g e dd i s cw h i c hs e a t sa g a i n s ta fl a to rt a p e r e d surface, or a circular sharp edge."
How does the hinged disc respond when the flow ceases or reverses direction?," A fluid stream moving through the valve in the free- flow direction swings the hinged disc from the seat and out of the flow path, thereby permitting a substantially unrestricted passage with very low pressure drop. When the flow through the valve stops or reverses its direction, the disc swings rapidly to its seat, thereby closing the valve against the reverse flow."
What specific condition makes swing-flapper check valves vulnerable to damage during fluid movement?," Very low pressure drops con be obtained with swing- flapper check valves, because small opening forces are required, and also because their disc swings out of the flow path. The presence of contaminating particles in the fluid has little effect on their performance. On the other hand, they are particularly subject to water hammer in case of sudden reversal of flow."
What type of check valves are preferred for applications needing low pressure drop and minimal fluid contamination control?," This is because their disc rotates through a large angle from the open position to the closed position, and consequently the velocity of the reverse flow increases signi ficantly before the complete closure of the disc. For this reason, their performance in eliminating a reverse flow is poor. Check valves of the swing- flapper type are used for applications requiring the minimum value of pressure drop and scarce control of fluid contamination."
What design feature of split-flapper check valves allows for reduced moment of inertia compared to single hinged disc valves?, They are not used for applications having a high tendency toward sudden flow reversal. Check valves of the split- flapper type have two or more hinged elements instead of one hinged disc. This makes it possible to reduce the moment of inertia of each hinged element. A typical split- flapper valve has two semi-circular elements which are open when the fluid stream moves through the valve in the free- flow direction 5.
What type of valve can better handle water hammer and supports a heavier life cycle?,"16 Design of Check Valves 553 and closed otherwise. A pressure drop in a split- flapper valve can be reduced to a minimum value, as is also the case with a swing- flapper valve. For two valves of the same size, the flapper is lighter in a split- flapper valve than is in a swing- flapper valve. In addition, a split- flapper valve can bear a heavier life cycle and has a better performance in case of water hammer than a valve of the other type."
What type of diaphragm is designed to rupture at a specific pressure in a tank or line?," Split- flapper valves are used principally in pneumatic systems. Their principal advantage is the minimum pressure drop for a given diameter. They are also scarcely sensitive to fluid contamination and have better performance than swing- flapper valves when a sudden flow reversal may occur. 5.17 Design of Burst Discs A burst disc, also known as a safety disc or a rupture disc or a frangible disc, is a thin metallic diaphragm designed to burst when the pressure in a tank or in a line exceeds a pre-set value."
What type of stress causes a burst disc to rupture in a flow-carrying line?," For example, a burst disc is used in a flow-carrying line to initiate flow when ruptured by suf ficient pressure in the line. A burst disc commonly used is one of the pre-bulged type, which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]. The burst disc shown in the preceding figure bursts due to tension induced by pressure, without the use of local weakening such as coined or machined grooves to initiate and control the bursting."
What mechanism allows the reverse-action knife-blade burst disc to require lower pressure to rupture compared to pre-bulged designs?," Another type of burst disc commonly used is the reverse-action knife-blade burst disc, shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]. 554 5 Control Systems and Valves The burst disc illustrated in the preceding figure reverses its form under pressure and buckles onto a knife edge, thus requiring a lower pressure to burst than one of the pre-bulged type."
What mechanism applies pressure to the circular cutter in the described system?," Ab u r s td i s co ft h es h e a rt y p ei ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et ot h ec o u r t e s y of NASA [ 43]. The burst disc shown above, before rupture (left) and after rupture (right), is pressure-loaded on a circular cutter by means of a Belleville spring, which is compressed into the negative-spring-rate region of the spring stroke."
What happens to the supporting force of the Belleville spring when the pressure surpasses the designated burst threshold?," The Belleville spring supports a portion of the pressure acting on the burst disc up to a pre-set burst pressure. When this value of pressure is exceeded, the spring washer starts to stroke, its supporting force decreases rapidly, and the pressure causes the disc to be sheared by the sharp circular cutter."
What is the purpose of a catch screen in relation to the cut disc?," A catch screen may be required to keep the cut disc from moving downstream. The burst pressure of the disc can be pre-set by replacing the cutter with a flat plug and adjusting the Belleville spring washer until the desired burst pressure is indicated by the motion of the burst disc [ 43]. Burst discs are used for many components of rocket engines, such as hypergolic- start cartridges, repeat-start turbine spinner assemblies, pump-seal drain lines, and some instrumentation."
What key factor must be considered in designing a rupture disc to ensure it withstands all storage conditions?," They are also used to seal a cavity against downstream pressure or temperature, or to contain a liquid until a rise of pressure to a desired level ruptures the disc. The burst pressure is the primary element to be considered in the design of a burst disc. This is because a burst disc must remain intact in all conditions of storage, 5."
"What is the typical range of burst pressure for discs used in specific applications, expressed in N/m²?","17 Design of Burst Discs 555 handling, and use of storable or cryogenic fluids, until the desired burst pressure is reached. The value of the burst pressure usually ranges from 6.895 ×103to 6.895 × 107N/m2[43], depending on the application. Low values of burst pressure are desired for a cartridge containing an ignition aid for the thrust chamber of a rocket engine, in order to burst the cartridge discs, release the ignition aid, and establish ignition as soon as possible."
What pressures should not cause early rupture in discs due to vapor pressure or thermal expansion?," Of course, the burst pressure must not be so low as to cause premature rupture in the discs due to the vapour pressure or to the thermal expansion of the propellants, or to handling loads. High values of burst pressure are desired for a burst disc used for the ignition of a pyrotechnic device, so long as the burning rate of the charge does not become excessive and the pressure level remains below the allowable operating pressure of the container [ 43]."
What is the upper temperature limit for aluminium alloys used in burst discs?," Burst discs are made of aluminium alloys, mild steel, stainless steel, nickel, Monel®,I n c o n e l®,c o p p e r ,s i l v e r ,g o l d ,a n dp l a t i n u m .A l u m i n i u mi su s e db e c a u s e of its low physical properties and good forming and machining properties. However, since the properties of this material vary widely with temperature, the upper temper- ature limit is only about 394 K [ 43]."
What materials mentioned resist corrosion and have desirable physical properties?," Mild steel requires protection from corrosion. This material has low cost and good formability. Stainless steel and Inconel®are dif ficult to tool. Inconel®can be used over a wide range of temperatures. Silver, gold, and platinum resist corrosion and have good physical properties. Burst discs can be attached mechanically or by welding."
What is the thickness range of burst discs when referring to coined-groove design?," They must not be corroded by the fluid, and the materials of which they are made must not cause decomposition in the fluid. The thickness of burst discs ranges from 0.05 to 3.18 mm [ 43], in case of coined- groove discs, for the material remaining under the groove. In this type of disc, the material is weakened locally by grooves which are stamped into the metal."
"What are explosive valves also referred to as, and how are they actuated?"," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43], shows three patterns (radial, single hinge, and double hinge) used for these grooves. 556 5 Control Systems and Valves 5.18 Design of Explosive Valves Explosive valves, also known as squib valves, are shut-off devices actuated by a very compact source of energy only once in a given mission."
What is the typical durability of most explosive valves after activation?," The source of energy used by them is an explosive charge which generates high pressure on an actuator. It is possible to actuate repeatedly an explosive valve by using multiple squibs. However, most explosive valves are designed to operate only once, and are either replaced or refurbished after use."
What is the approach taken to evaluate the reliability of valves that cannot be tested without destruction?," Since the explosive charge is expendable, the remaining part of the valve is often designed to be also expendable. This makes it possible to reduce mass and obtain very good sealing. These valves cannot be tested non-destructively. Therefore, their reliability for as p e c i fi cm i s s i o nm u s tb ee v a l u a t e ds t a t i s t i c a l l y ,b yp u r c h a s i n gal a r g en u m b e ro f them for quali fication."
What are the two methods by which chemical energy from explosive charges can be released?," Explosive valves are actuated by mechanical energy resulting from conversion of chemical energy contained in explosive charges. This chemical energy can be released by the charges either by de flagration, which is the rapid combustion of the explosive material, or by detonation, which is the propagation of a shock wave through the explosive material."
What type of energy is produced by the shock wave in detonation compared to the work done by gases in deflagration?," In case of de flagration, the mechanical energy obtained is the work done by the combusted gases acting on a piston. In case of detonation, the mechanical energy obtained is due to the momentum of the shock wave propagating through the explosive charge. This momentum is transferred to a piston, as if the end of the piston were subject to a sharp blow."
What is the diameter of a typical normally-closed valve that requires explosive material for actuation?," In either case, a small amount of explosive material is necessary to actuate a valve. For example, a typical normally-closed valve, 19.05 mm in diameter, whose working pressure is 2.759 ×107N/m2,u s e s1 4 0m go fe x p l o s i v em a t e r i a l .T h e explosive pressure of this valve is about 1.724 ×107N/m8[25]."
What is the thickness of the disc in a typical design valve used for explosive applications?," Ad e fl a g r a t i n gc h a r g eu s e df o re x p l o s i v ev a l v e sc o n s i s t so fs m a l l fl a k e - l i k ep a r t i - cles of powder similar to shotgun powder. A valve of typical design has a disc 0.254 mm in thickness and 1.27 mm in diameter. A detonating charge uses explosive materials such as PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), or DDNP (diazodinitrophenol), or RDX (1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine)."
What methods can ignite a charge in a sensitive primer?," The explosion of a charge is obtained by a transfer of mechanical or electrical energy to a sensitive primer, such as lead styphnate. For this purpose, the charge is ignited by striking a sharp blow to the primer through a metallic barrier, like the firing pin of a gun, or by piercing abruptly the container of the primer by means of as h a r pp r o b e ,o rb yh e a t i n ge l e c t r i c a l l yt h ep r i m e rb ym e a n so fab r i d g e - w i r e ."
What voltage is required for an exploding bridge-wire compared to a conventional firing pulse?," The ignition of a detonating or de flagrating charge may also be obtained without the primer, by using an exploding bridge-wire (EBW). In this case, it is necessary to use a firing pulse of several thousand volts, in comparison with a conventional firing pulse of about 28 V or even less. An exploding bridge-wire is extremely insensitive to accidental firing, but requires a high voltage obtained by discharging a condenser contained in a firing circuit."
"What type of ignition mechanism is utilized in the explosive cartridge designed by Holex, Inc.?"," 5.18 Design of Explosive Valves 557 At y p i c a le x p l o s i v ec a r t r i d g e( d e s i g n e db yH o l e x ,I n c . ) ,c o m m o n l yu s e df o re x p l o - sive valves and having a low-voltage bridge-wire, is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 25]. The charge in the cartridge shown above is ignited by means of an electrical connector incorporated in the cartridge."
What is the maximum pressure generated by the ignition of the charge within the cartridge?," The charge is hermetically sealed to be protected from moisture and damage. The cartridge contains 188 mg of de flagrating charge, and the pressure generated by the ignition can be as high as 4.137 ×108N/m8. The shock attenuator plug incorporated in the cartridge weakens the shock waves before they reach the ceramic seals."
What materials are used for the connector pins and the casing of the cartridge igniter?," The electrical conductors are two connector pins made of stainless steel, and the case is made of the same material. The pins are locked into the case by fused ceramic seals. The current necessary to ignite a cartridge like this ranges from 1 to 5 A, and the firing time ranges from 1 to 20 ms [ 25]."
How can the normally closed valve be made reusable?," Some explosive valves are illustrated below. The following figure, due to the cour- tesy of NASA [ 43], shows a normally closed valve which opens when the explosive charge actuates a pin (ram) which shears the end from the inlet fitting and retains it in a recess of the body. 558 5 Control Systems and Valves The valve shown above can be made reusable by replacing the explosive charge and the inlet fitting."
What component is sheared from the body of a normally closed non-reusable valve after it is fired?," A reusable valve must be cleaned immediately after firing. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43], shows a normally closed non-reusable valve, as it appears after firing. In this valve, a diaphragm is sheared from the body by the ram and is clamped by the ram to be retained within the body."
What component in the valve's design shears through the flow passage to stop the fluid flow?," An o r m a l l yo p e nv a l v e ,a si ta p p e a r sb e f o r e fi r i n g ,i ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e , due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]. In this valve, the explosive charge actuates the ram, which shears through the flow passage and wedges between the openings to close the flow passage."
What is the sequence of steps to open and re-open the normally closed valve using explosive charges?," 5.18 Design of Explosive Valves 559 Ad u a lf u n c t i o ne x p l o s i v ev a l v e( U . S .P a t e n tN o .3 , 1 2 2 , 1 5 4 )i ss h o w ni nt h e following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]. The valve shown above is normally closed (a), is opened (b) by firing the first explosive charge, and is re-opened (c) by firing the second explosive charge."
What type of fit is utilized between the spool's lands and the body for sealing?, Sealing is provided by interference sliding fits between the lands on the spool and the body. Ah o l eb a l a n c e st h ea c t u a t i o np r e s s u r eo ne a c he n do ft h es p o o la f t e rt h es p o o lt r a v e l . Explosive valves are usually employed in lines of small diameters (less than 25 mm).
How are explosive valves for larger diameters operated according to the mentioned patent?," However, explosive valves for lines of greater diameters can be obtained by using the energy of the fluid to open and close the valve, in which case the ram is used only as a latch, as shown for the valve (U.S. Patent No. 3,017,894) illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 43]."
What advantage do redundant explosive valves provide in critical applications?," 560 5 Control Systems and Valves Explosive valves are highly reliable components, when used properly. However, redundant explosive valves have also been used for some critical applications. References 1. Åström KJ, Murray RM (2008) Feedback systems: an introduction for scientists and engineers.

What assumption is made about the wall thickness of a tank relative to the radii of curvature of its middle surface?,"org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_6563 564 6 Tanks for Propellants The word shell is used here because, at any point of a tank, the thickness of its wall is assumed to be constant and much smaller than the radii of curvature of its middle surface [ 2]. As u r f a c eo fr e v o l u t i o nr e s u l t sf r o mr o t a t i n gap l a n ec u r v ea b o u ts o m es t r a i g h t line (called the axis of revolution) lying in the plane which contains the curve."
What term describes the line formed by the intersection of a surface of revolution with a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution?, A line resulting from the intersection of a surface of revolution with a plane containing the axis of revolution is called a meridian.

The structural analysis of tanks which will be presented in this chapter is largely due to Roark’s formulas for stress and strain [ 3]."
What type of stresses in a shell remains consistent throughout its thickness when subjected to loads?," When a shell is subject to distributed loads resulting from internal or external pressure, the predominant stresses acting on the shell are membrane stresses, which are stresses whose amount is constant through the thickness of the shell. Generally speaking, the stresses acting in a point of a shell are •am e r i d i a nm e m b r a n es t r e s s σ1,w h o s ed i r e c t i o ni sp a r a l l e lt ot h el o c a lm e r i d i a n ; •ac i r c u m f e r e n t i a lm e m b r a n es t r e s s σ2,w h o s ed i r e c t i o ni sp a r a l l e lt ot h el o c a l circumference; and •a small radial stress σ3,w h i c hv a r i e st h r o u g ht h et h i c k n e s so ft h es h e l l ."
What types of strains are caused by the stresses in a shell?," In addition to these stresses, there may be bending or shear stresses due to loading, or to physical properties of the shell, or to the supporting structure. The stresses considered above cause meridian, circumferential, and radial strains in a shell, and therefore changes in the slopes if its meridians."
What type of stresses are considered the most significant in a thin shell subjected to uniformly distributed loading?," The circumferences of a shell may also deviate from their circular form when buckling occurs. When a thin shell (one whose thickness is less than one tenth of its smaller radius of curvature) has no abrupt changes in thickness, slope, or curvature, and is subject to a loading uniformly distributed or smoothly varying and axisymmetric, then the meridian σ1and circumferential σ2membrane stresses are practically uniform through the thickness of the wall, and are also the most important stresses acting on the shell."
What types of shapes can the formulae for calculating stresses and strains be applied to?," The radial stress σ3and stresses induced by bending moments are negli- gible. In this case, the formulae of [ 3,T a b l e1 3 . 1 ]c a nb eu s e dt oc o m p u t es t r e s s e s and strains such as those described above for shells of cylindrical, conical, spherical, and toroidal shapes. Examples of application will be given in the following sections."
What is required for the radial deformations and rotations of meridians at the junction of two thin shells?," 6.2 Tanks Subject Only to Membrane Stresses Two thin shells can be joined together to form a tank. When it is desired to have no bending stresses at the junction in case of uniformly distributed or smoothly varying loads, then it is necessary to choose shells such that the radial deformations ∆Rand the rotations ψof the meridians be the same for each of them at the point of junction."
"What is the formula for radial deformation of a cylindrical shell under uniform internal pressure in terms of radius, thickness, Young modulus, and Poisson ratio?"," 6.2 Tanks Subject Only to Membrane Stresses 565 For example, a cylindrical shell of radius R(m) and thickness t(m), subject to uniform internal pressure q(N/m2), see [ 3,T a b l e1 3 . 1 ,c a s e1 c ] ,h a sar a d i a l deformation ∆R(m) ζDeltaηR=qR2 Et/parenleftBig 1 - ν 2/parenrightBig where E(N/m2)a n d νare respectively the Young modulus and the Poisson ratio of the material, whereas a hemispherical shell of equal radius and thickness, subject to the same pressure, see [ 3,T a b l e1 3 ."

The different radial deformations ∆Rcause bending and shear stresses in the vicinity of the junction. The following figure shows a shell, whose middle surface is a smooth surface of revolution, not necessarily a hemisphere, subject to a uniform internal pressure q[3, Table 13."
What do the expressions for radial deformations and rotations indicate about meridians when the radius of curvature reaches infinity at θ equals π/2?,"1, case 4a].

How should control systems and structures of launch vehicles be designed to manage significant loads from moving liquid propellants?," Since the initial masses of these vehicles consist prin- cipally of liquid propellants, then the time-varying loads due to the motion of such masses in their tanks are very large. The control systems and the structures of launch vehicles are to be designed in such a way as to respectively counteract and resist such loads."
"What must be maintained between the natural frequencies of control systems, elastic bodies, and liquid sloshing to prevent large forces and moments?"," The dynamical systems which describe the motion of liquid masses into moving containers are very complex, because of couplings of the components of such systems. In particular, the natural frequencies of the control systems, of the elastic bodies, and of the liquid sloshing are to be kept separated as widely as possible, because large forces and moments can be generated by a liquid propellant oscillating at one of its natural frequencies in a partially filled tank."
What term describes the periodic motion of a liquid's free surface in a partially filled container due to vehicle displacements or rotations?," Unfortunately, such is not always the case, as shown in the following table, adapted from [ 6], which refers to some representative launch vehicles. By sloshing we mean the periodic motion of the free surface of a liquid in a partially filled container [ 7]. This motion results from longitudinal and lateral displacements or angular rotations of the vehicle carrying the container."
What phenomenon occurs on the free surface of a liquid in a partially filled tank when subjected to horizontal oscillation?," In particular, lateral sloshing is the standing wave formed on the free surface of al i q u i dw h e nat a n kp a r t i a l l y fi l l e di sc a u s e dt oo s c i l l a t eh o r i z o n t a l l y[ 8], that is, 594 6 Tanks for Propellants in a plane parallel to the free surface of the quiescent liquid."
What type of sloshing is characterized by a symmetric response to tank motions perpendicular to the liquid surface?," Lateral sloshing is antisymmetric, and occurs primarily in response to translational or pitching motions of a tank. By contrast, vertical sloshing is symmetric, and occurs primarily in response to motions of a tank in the direction perpendicular to the free surface of the quiescent liquid. Rotational sloshing is a motion exhibiting an apparent swirling of a liquid about a normal axis, and arising as an instability of the antisymmetric lateral sloshing near resonance [ 6]."
What are some factors that can cause oscillations in space vehicle tanks?," The tanks of space vehicles may be subject to oscillations for several causes, which act either separately or in combination. Some examples of these causes, identi fied by Abramson et al. [ 9], are •wind gusts during powered flight; •programmed changes of attitude of the vehicle; •control pulses for attitude stabilisation; •separation impulses; and •elastic deformations of the vehicle."
What factors influence the forces and moments resulting from sloshing in a tank?," The magnitude of the forces and moments due to sloshing depend upon •shape of the tank; •properties of the propellants; •damping; •height of the propellant in the tank; •acceleration; and •perturbing motion of the tank. The sloshing phenomenon and its consequence on the stability of a space vehicle can be controlled by a proper design of the tank and by the addition of baf fles, as will be shown in Sect."

The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6], shows (left) ring baf fles mounted on the wall of a circular cylindrical tank wall by means of Z-ring stiffeners, and (right) some typical shapes of tanks."
What factors influence the strength of baffles in tanks subject to propellant sloshing?," 6.5 Tanks Subject to Loads Due to Propellant Sloshing 595 The number and the type of baf fles depend on the damping requirements. The strength of the baf fles depends on several factors, among which the strength and the rigidity required during manufacturing and handling, the mechanical and thermal stresses due to propellant loading, and the forces and moments due to propellant sloshing [ 9]."
How does the interaction between sloshing propellant and tank structure affect vibration frequencies and mode shapes?," The coupling between a sloshing propellant and the elastic structure of its tank may have a large in fluence on the vibration frequencies and on the mode shapes of the tank. In addition, the system comprising a sloshing propellant and its tank may have dynamic instabilities either by itself or by coupling with some other components of a rocket engine subject to oscillations, as is the case with the combustion and feed-line systems."
What components make up the mechanical model used to assess sloshing loads in a space vehicle's oscillating tank?, The dynamic response of a space vehicle to sloshing loads can be determined by using an equivalent mechanical model which represents the behaviour of an oscil- lating tank partially filled with a liquid propellant. This mechanical model consists of fixed masses ( mf)a n do s c i l l a t i n gm a s s e s( ms)c o n n e c t e dt ot h et a n kb ys p r i n g sa n d dashpots or by pendulums and dashpots.
What aspects are matched between the mechanical models and the actual oscillating propellant in the second case?," The second case is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 10]. Each mechanical model refers to a particular shape of tank, and is designed so as to have the same resultant force, moment, damping, and natural frequencies as the actual oscillating propellant. This model is then combined with other dynamic elements of the space vehicle being considered, and the dynamic behaviour of the whole system is studied by means of digital or analogue computers."
What percentage of the first mode's mass does the second mode's sloshing mass represent in a 596 6 Tanks for Propellants tank?," The number of slosh masses msincluded in an equivalent mechanical model corresponds to the number of slosh modes considered in the analysis. In case of a 596 6 Tanks for Propellants circular cylindrical tank, the sloshing mass corresponding to the second mode has been found to be about 3% of the mass corresponding to the first node, and therefore the sloshing effects due to the second and higher modes are generally negligible for a tank of this shape."
What percentage of the first mode mass does the second mode mass represent for a quarter tank?," However, for a quarter tank, the sloshing mass corresponding to the second mode is 43% of the mass corresponding to the first mode, and therefore should be included in determining the total sloshing loads acting on the tank [ 9]. Sloshing effects in tanks having arbitrary shapes have been studied by various authors (see, for example, [ 6,11])."
What is the relationship between angular frequencies and the values determined from the roots of a specific Bessel function equation in liquid sloshing?," For lateral sloshing of a liquid propellant in a rigid circular cylindrical tank with a fl a tb o t t o m ,t h ef r e q u e n c i e s fn(Hz) of the oscillating free surface have been found [6,9]t ob e fn=ωn 2π=1 2π [ εng Rtanh ( εnh R ) ] 1 2 where ωn(rad/s) are the angular frequencies, g(m/s2)i st h ev e r t i c a la c c e l e r a t i o no f the tank, εnare values determined from the roots of the following equation ( dJ1(x) dx ) x=εn=0 J1(x)i st h eB e s s e lf u n c t i o no ft h e fi r s tk i n da n do r d e r , R(m) is the radius of the circular cylindrical tank, and h(m) is the height of the free surface of the quiescent liquid propellant."
What is the value of εn for the fourth slosh mode?," Values of εnfor the first four slosh modes are given in the following table (from [ 9]): Slosh mode (n) εn 1 1.841 2 5.331 3 8.536 4 11.706 Abramson et al.

What is the interval for the angles of oscillation in the linear damping model of the pendulums?," [10]. This linear (dashpot damping c=constant) model assumes the angles θof oscillation of the pendulums to be within the interval ±π/12 [12). 6.5 Tanks Subject to Loads Due to Propellant Sloshing 597 Since the dominant sloshing frequency f1corresponds to n=1a n dt h e r e f o r et o the root ε1=1.841 of the equation J′ 1=0, then Pérez et al."

What is typically inadequate for providing stability in smooth-wall tanks used for propellants?," 598 6 Tanks for Propellants The magnitude of damping in smooth-wall and in baf fled-wall tanks has been determined for several shapes. Generally speaking, the amount of damping due to the wiping action of a liquid propellant against the walls of a tank is insuf ficient, and therefore baf fles must be added to provide the damping required to prevent instability."
What type of damping is specifically studied for circular cylindrical tanks without baffles?," For example, a circular cylindrical tank having ring baf fles of width w along its wall is shown in the preceding figure. The damping of liquid propellants in circular cylindrical tanks without baf fles has been studied by Stephens et al. [ 13]. Viscous damping of liquid propellants in tanks of various shapes has been studied by several authors."
What is the damping ratio for a circular cylindrical tank without baffles according to Mikishev and Dorozhkin's experimental equation?," By viscous damping we mean the damping produced by interaction between the liquid propellant and the wall of the tank. An account of empirical formulae for tanks of various shapes is given in [6, 8]. For example, for a circular cylindrical tank without baf fles, the damping ratio ζis expressed by the following experimental equation due to Mikishev and Dorozhkin [ 8]: ζ=0."
What is the approximate value of ζ when the liquid depth exceeds the tank's diameter?,"79 ( µ rho ) 1 2 R - 3 4g - 1 4/braceleftbigg 1+0.318 sinh(1.84h/R) [ 1 - h/R cosh(1.84h/R)+1 ] /bracerightbigg where µ/ rho is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid, Ris the radius of the cross section of the tank, and gis the vertical acceleration. When the depth hof the liquid is greater than the diameter 2 Rof the tank cross section, then the preceding equation can be approximated as follows ζ=0."
What is the formula to estimate the damping ratio for a flat ring rigid baffle in a circular cylindrical tank with specific depth and radius conditions?,"79 ( µ rho ) 1 2 R - 3 4g - 1 4 Effective damping provided by baf fles of various types has also been investigated by several authors. An account is given in [ 6,8]. With reference to the preceding figure, Dodge [ 8]i n d i c a t e st h ef o l l o w i n ge q u a t i o n ,d u et oM i l e s[ 16], to estimate the damping ratio ζfor a flat ring rigid baf fle in a circular cylindrical tank where the liquid depth his considerably greater than the cross-sectional radius R(h/R>2 ) : ζ=2."
What is the formula for the ratio of the baffle area to the tank cross-sectional area in a circular cylindrical tank?,"83C3 2 1/parenleftBigη R/parenrightBig1 2exp ( - 4.6d R ) where C1is the ratio of the baf fle area ABto the tank cross-sectional area AT,a n d therefore C1is for a circular cylindrical tank C1=AB AT=πR2 - π(R - w)2 πR2=w R/parenleftBig 2 - w R/parenrightBig wis the width of the ring baf fles, Ris the radius of the cross section of the tank, ηis the amplitude of oscillation measured at the tank wall from the free surface of the quiescent liquid, and dis the depth of the baf fle below the free surface of the quiescent liquid."
What is the required spacing between ring baffles for effective linear superposition in cylindrical tanks?," For circular cylindrical tanks, the damping provided by a series of 6.5 Tanks Subject to Loads Due to Propellant Sloshing 599 ring baf fles can be calculated by superposing linearly the contribution of each baf fle, when the spacing sbetween the baf fles is greater than the width wof each baf fle. For tanks of this shape, ring baf fles are usually placed at a distance s≤0."
What types of baffles are examined for circular cylindrical tanks?,"2R[10]. Types of baf fles studied for circular cylindrical tanks include fixed rings, rings with radial clearance, cruciform baf fles, and baf fles shaped as conic sections. Baf fles have also been studied for spherical tanks and for oblate or prolate spheroidal tanks. Flexible baf fles have been compared to rigid baf fles, and the former have been found to provide greater damping than the latter under certain conditions [ 9]."
What are the two types of baffles mentioned for use in cylindrical tanks?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6], shows some types of ring baf fles used for circular cylindrical tanks. The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6], shows some types of cruciform baf fles used for tanks of various shapes. 600 6 Tanks for Propellants Sloshing loads under low gravity conditions have been found small in comparison with the structural capability of propellant tanks."
What are the implications of lateral sloshing on the structural integrity and control systems of tanks used in space vehicles?," This topic is dealt with at length in [6,8]. The lateral sloshing of liquid propellants in their tanks causes a distributed pressure loading on the walls. These loads are important for the structural design of the tanks. In addition, the resultant force and moment due to the distributed pressure are important for the control systems of space vehicles."
"What types of pressure loads on tanks are mentioned, and which is considered less significant?"," The longitudinal sloshing of liquid propellant also causes pressure loads on the tanks. These loads are less important than those due to lateral sloshing. However, the longitudinal pressure modes of a propellant may couple with those of the elastic shell or with those of the feed-line and combustion system."
What type of instability can result from dynamic factors in circular cylindrical tanks during vertical acceleration changes?," This fact can generate dynamic instability, as is the case with the pogo oscillations. 6.5 Tanks Subject to Loads Due to Propellant Sloshing 601 Loads acting on the top or on the bottom of a circular cylindrical tank can be caused by sudden changes of the net acceleration in the vertical direction. This may occur in such cases as abort just after launch, cut-off of the boost engine, engine start in orbit or in coast flight, et c."
What factors influence the pressure loads in a circular cylindrical tank during lateral sloshing?," These loads are very sensitive to the test conditions and to the shapes of tanks [ 9]. In case of a circular cylindrical tank subject to lateral sloshing, a simple estimate of the pressure loads can be done by considering the tank pressurisation p0, the static pressure rho gzdue to the liquid propellant in the tank, and the pressure due to the lateral sloshing at its lowest natural frequency f1=ω1/(2π), corresponding to the first mode of oscillation."
What parameters are involved in the equation for maximum pressure in a tank due to lateral sloshing?," In other words, the maximum pressure pmax(N/m2)o na tank subject to lateral sloshing occurs in the plane of oscillation and can be expressed by using the following equation of [ 9]: pmax=p0+ rho gz+ rho gηcosh [ 1.841 ( h - z R ) ] cosh [ 1.841h R ] sin(ω1t) where rho (kg/m3)i st h ed e n s i t yo ft h el i q u i dp r o p e l l a n ti nt h eo p e r a t i o n a lc o n d i t i o n s , g(m/s2)i st h ev e r t i c a la c c e l e r a t i o no ft h et a n k , η(m) is the maximum height above the free surface of the quiescent liquid at the wall, R(m) is the radius of the tank, h (m) is the height of the free surface of the quiescent liquid, z(m) is the distance from the free surface of the quiescent liquid to any arbitrary depth (positive downward), andω1(rad/s) is the first natural angular frequency of lateral slosh, whose value has been found above to be ω1= [ 1."
What occurs when the total vertical acceleration reaches instantaneous zero during sloshing of a propellant?,"841g Rtanh ( 1.841h R ) ] 1 2 Abramson et al. [ 9]p o i n to u tt h a tt h et o t a lv e r t i c a la c c e l e r a t i o na c t i n go nap a r t i c l e of the free surface varies between g - ηω2 1andg+ηω2 1at the wall of the tank. When the amplitude of the sloshing propellant becomes large enough for the total vertical acceleration to be instantaneously zero, then the sloshing wave breaks up, and turbulent sloshing begins."
What happens to the oscillations of the liquid propellant when the height of the free surface is equal to or greater than the tank's radius?," Taking this condition as an upper limit yields η=g/ω2 1, and therefore the equation expressing the maximum pressure can be re-written as follows pmax=p0+ rho g { z+Rcosh [ 1.841 ( h - z R ) ] 1.841 sinh [ 1.841h R ] } When the height hof the free surface is roughly equal to or greater than the radius Rof the tank, the oscillations of the liquid propellant become independent of h,a n d the equation expressing the maximum pressure can be approximated as follows [ 9]: pmax=p0+ rho g [ z+R 1."
What conditions allow the equation to approximate pressures in tanks with non-flat bottom surfaces?,"841exp/parenleftBig - 1.841z R/parenrightBig ] 602 6 Tanks for Propellants This equation still holds approximately in cases of tanks whose bottom surfaces are not flat. In case of non-cylindrical tanks, the maximum pressure can be expressed by using other formulae, for example, those of [ 6,8], or [ 11]."
What portion of liquid propellant in a tank is generally unaffected by sloshing near the free surface?," Generally speaking, one third of the liquid propellant, the part of it which is near the bottom of the tank, is not affected by sloshing, which occurs near the free surface. The equivalent mechanical models consisting of fixed masses and oscillating masses are based on this fact. The sloshing mass and the resultant force decrease considerably in the higher modes of oscillations."
How does dividing a cylindrical tank into radial sectors affect the first and second slosh frequencies?," For the lower modes, the sloshing mass can be reduced by dividing a tank into radial or concentric compartments. Some typical con figurations used for propellant tanks are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6]. On the effectiveness of dividing a tank into compartments for the purpose of reducing the sloshing mass, Dodge [ 8]n o t e st h a t ,f o rac i r c u l a rc y l i n d r i c a lt a n k , the division into radial sectors raises the first (or fundamental) slosh frequency and lowers the second, so that the two modes are less separated in frequency."
What is the effect of radial compartments compared to ring baffles on sloshing forces and moments?," In addition, radial compartments are less effective than ring baf fles in reducing the amplitude of forces and moments due to sloshing [ 8]. When a liquid propellant sloshes in a longitudinal mode, the pressures integrated over the bottom and the walls of the tank have a zero resultant force. An estimate of the pressure p(N/m2)d u r i n gs l o s h i n gi nac i r c u l a rc y l i n d r i c a lt a n ka tt h e fi r s tl o n g i t u d i n a l angular frequency ω1(rad/s) can be done by using the following formula of [ 9]: p=p0+ rho g { z+ηJ0 ( 3."

What causes the issue of liquid propellant impacting the tank's dome during specific conditions in a launch vehicle?," Longitudinal accelerations impressed to a partially filled tank can cause a liquid propellant to impinge on the dome of the tank. The problem of dome impact arises when the resultant acceleration acting on the tank reverses its direction. This may occur during engine shutdown of a launch vehicle flying through the atmosphere, or when an engine is ignited while the propellant is located in the upper part of a tank [6]."
What types of methods are used to analyze the loads affecting deflector baffles in tanks?," The impulsive pressure resulting from one of such events must be taken into account when assessing the structural integrity of a tank. This problem is considered at length in [ 6]. The impact of a liquid propellant on de flector baf fles may also produce considerable loads. There being no general methods of analysis for predicting such loads, empirical methods or tests or both are used for this purpose."
What factors determine the maximum pressure acting on a submerged baffled fluid?," Ring baf fles and other internal devices can reduce fluid impact loads [ 9]. The maximum pressure p(N/m2)a c t i n go nas u b m e r g e db a f fl eo fw i d t h w(m), subject to an oscillating velocity U=Umcos(ωt)( m / s ) ,d u eal i q u i dp r o p e l l a n t sloshing at an angular frequency ω(rad/s), is given by the following equation of [ 9]: p=K rho U2 m where Kis a non-dimensional parameter whose values are given in the following figure of [ 9,15] 604 6 Tanks for Propellants and rho (kg/m3)a n d Um(m/s) are respectively the density and the maximum velocity of the liquid propellant in the operating conditions."
What variables are necessary to calculate the maximum vertical velocity of the sloshing liquid in a circular cylindrical tank?," The maximum vertical velocity Um(m/s) of the sloshing liquid at any distance z (m), positive downward, from the free surface of the quiescent liquid to any arbitrary depth in a circular cylindrical tank is given by the following equation of [ 9]: Um=1.841g ω1Rηsinh [ 1.841 ( h - z R ) ] cosh [ 1.841 ( h R ) ] where g(m/s2)i st h ev e r t i c a la c c e l e r a t i o no ft h et a n k , R(m) is the radius of the cross section of the tank, h(m) is the height of the free surface of the quiescent liquid, η (m) is the amplitude of oscillation measured at the tank wall from the free surface of the quiescent liquid, and ω1(rad/s) is the first natural angular frequency of lateral slosh, whose value has been found above to be ω1= [ 1."
"What is the pressure on the baffle due to the sloshing liquid propellant in terms of K, ρ, ω, and η?","841g Rtanh ( 1.841h R ) ] 1 2 By using these equation and assuming the height hof the propellant to be equal to or greater than the radius Rof the tank, the equation p=K rho U2 m,w h i c he x p r e s s e s the pressure on the baf fle due to the sloshing liquid propellant, can be approximated as follows [ 9]: p=K rho ω2 1η2exp/parenleftBig - 3."
How can the pressure acting on a ring baffle be decreased?,"682z R/parenrightBig After setting again η=g/ω2 1,t h em a x i m u mp r e s s u r eo nar i n gb a f fl ep l a c e da t the depth zfrom the free surface can be expressed as follows p=K rho gR 1.841exp/parenleftBig - 3.682z R/parenrightBig 6.5 Tanks Subject to Loads Due to Propellant Sloshing 605 The pressure acting on a ring baf fle can be reduced by perforating the ring baf fle with small holes."
What effect does the oscillating flow through holes have on the damping in a perforated baffle?," This is because the oscillating flow through the holes is an additional source of damping. However, this increased damping is partially offset by a decrease in the effective area of a perforated baf fle [ 8]. Ar i n gb a f fl e ,w h i c hi sj u s ta b o v et h ef r e es u r f a c eo faq u i e s c e n tl i q u i dp r o p e l l a n t , is periodically subject to the slapping action of the sloshing wave."
What is the maximum pressure on the baffle when h is greater than or equal to R?," In this case, the pressure acting on the baf fle is expressed by the following equation of [ 9]: p=2 rho U2 m where Umis the velocity of the liquid propellant at impact with the baf fle. By setting Um=ω1η1and substituting in the preceding equation, there results p=2 rho ω2 1η2 1 By setting again η1=g/ω2 1and assuming h≥R,t h em a x i m u mp r e s s u r eo nt h e baf fle is [ 9]: pmax=2 rho gR 1."
What variables must be determined when using different types of baffles for calculating maximum pressure?,"841 The methods discussed above have shown how to compute sloshing loads on baf fles of the ring type. When baf fles of other types, such as anti-vortex baf fles and truss-type baf fles, are used, then it is still possible to use the preceding equation p=K rho U2 m,w h i c h expresses the maximum pressure on the baf fle, but it is also necessary to determine the value of Kand the value of Umwhich apply to the case of interest."
What non-dimensional parameter relates to oscillatory flow around objects according to Keulegan and Carpenter?," Keulegan and Carpenter [ 15]g i v e sv a l u e so f Kfor oscillatory flow around cylinders and plates. Such values depend on the baf fle shape and on the non-dimensional parameter UmT/(2w), where Tis the natural period of oscillation. This parameter, in turn, requires the evaluation of Um.F o rt h i sp u r p o s e ,i nc a s eo fal i q u i dp r o p e l l a n ts l o s h i n g laterally in a circular cylindrical tank at its first angular frequency ω1,t h er a d i a l component urand the tangential component uθof the velocity vector uof the liquid propellant can be computed by using the following equations, due to Bauer [ 17], taken from [ 9]: ur=gη ω1 [ 1."

What devices are commonly utilized to mitigate sloshing effects in liquid propellant tanks?,"5has shown how to compute structural loads induced by the periodic motion (sloshing) of liquid propellants in their tanks. The present section describes some devices used for slosh damping. Those of them which have been most frequently used for this purpose are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [7]."
What is one method to decrease the sloshing mass of liquid propellants in tanks?," 6.6 Slosh-Suppression Devices for Tanks 607 Such devices are used not only to reduce sloshing loads, but also to protect tank bulkheads from impact loads caused by non-periodic motion of liquid propellants. As has been shown in Sect. 6.5,t h es l o s h i n gm a s s msof a liquid propellant, that is, the part of the total mass which moves during sloshing, can also be reduced by using tanks of appropriate shapes or divided into compartments."
What are the commonly employed methods for slosh damping inside a tank?," According to [ 7], slosh- suppression devices include rigid-ring baf fles, cruciform baf fles, de flectors, flexible flat-ring baf fles, floating cans, and positive-expulsion bags or diaphragms. A brief description of them is given below. The most frequently used manner of providing slosh damping in a tank is to install baf fles in the tank."
What are the dual purposes for installing baffles in a liquid propellant tank?," Such baf fles are placed in points which are slightly below the level of the free surface of the liquid propellant at the times in which damping is required. The baf fles can be installed either for the sole purpose of providing slosh damping in a tank, or also for structural reasons, to be used as wall-stiffener rings."
What is the expression for the damping ratio provided by rigid-ring baffles in circular cylindrical tanks?," In the latter case, their size is increased to provide the required damping. Rigid-ring baf fles are widely used as slosh-suppression devices. As has been shown in Sect. 6.5,t h ed a m p i n gr a t i o ζprovided by rigid-ring baf fles in circular cylindrical tanks is expressed by the Miles formula [ 16]a sf o l l o w s ζ=2."

What principle is used to calculate damping ratios for a series of flat-ring baffles when certain spacing conditions are met?," This formula is based on the assumption that the baf fle is completely submerged during a slosh cycle. As e r i e so f fl a t - r i n gb a f fl e si st h em o s tf r e q u e n t l yu s e ds l o s h - s u p p r e s s i o nd e v i c ei n circular cylindrical tanks.

"What types of tank shapes, aside from circular cylinders, are mentioned as studied for damping provided by baffles?"," Damping provided by baf fles in tanks of other shapes than circular cylinders has also been studied by several authors. An account of such studies is given in [ 6,8] for spherical, oblate and prolate spheroidal, and toroidal tanks. An experimental investigation was conducted by Sumner [ 18]t od e t e r m i n et h es l o s h - s u p p r e s s i o n effectiveness of rigid and flexible flat-plate annular-ring baf fles in spherical tanks subject to oscillations in the horizontal plane."
How did the position of the free surface of the liquid affect the effectiveness of the baffles in reducing slosh forces?," The baf fles caused a variation in the fundamental frequency of oscillation, and were found most effective in reducing the slosh forces and increasing the damping when the free surface of the quiescent liquid was slightly above the baf fle, so that the latter remained submerged during the oscillatory cycle of the liquid."
What is the optimal ratio of baffle width to tank radius for the spherical tanks studied?," The optimum baf fle width to tank radius ratio was found to be w/R=0.125 for the spherical tanks considered. A side view of the baf fles in the spherical tanks is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [18]. 608 6 Tanks for Propellants Stephens et al. [ 19]c o n d u c t e da ne x p e r i m e n t a li n v e s t i g a t i o no ft h ed a m p i n go f liquid oscillations in an oblate spheroidal tank."
How does the addition of ring baffles affect effective damping in tanks with varying liquid depths?," The decay of the fundamental mode was studied for a range of liquid depths in tanks with and without baf fles. The results indicate that the addition of ring baf fles to the tank results in an increase in the available effective damping when the baf fle plane is in a region near the equilibrium liquid surface, and that cruciform baf fles are effective in the damping of the fundamental mode in the near-empty tank [ 19]."
What advantages do flexible annular ring baffles have over rigid ones according to the experimental study?," As has been anticipated in Sect. 6.5, fl e x i b l e - r i n gb a f fl e sc a no f f e rs u b s t a n t i a l advantages, upon certain conditions, over rigid-ring baf fles. Such advantages concern higher damping effectiveness and lower mass. An experimental study conducted by Stephens and Scholl [ 20]f o rl a r g e - s c a l ec y l i n d r i c a lt a n k s fi t t e dw i t hb o t h fl e x i b l ea n d rigid annular ring baf fles has shown that slosh damping comparable to that provided by rigid baf fles can be obtained by using smaller and less massive flexible baf fles."
What are the three non-dimensional parameters used to describe the characteristics of sloshing liquid and baffling systems?," Stephens and Scholl have shown that the characteristics of the sloshing liquid, the flexibility of the baf fles, and the damping can speci fied by three non-dimensional parameters. These parameters are: (1) the period parameter P,w h i c hd e s c r i b e st h e velocity of the liquid in the vicinity of the baf fle; (2) the flexibility parameter F,w h i c h de fines the de flection of the baf fle per unit loading; and (3) the relative damping parameter δ/δr,w h i c hi st h er a t i oo ft h ed a m p i n gf a c t o r δprovided by the flexible baf fle to the damping factor δrprovided by a rigid baf fle of the same width wand under the same flow conditions as those of the flexible baf fle."
"What non-dimensional parameter is defined as the product of liquid propellant maximum velocity, natural oscillation period, and baffle width?"," The results found by Stephens and Scholl are shown graphically in the following figure, adapted from [ 20]. 6.6 Slosh-Suppression Devices for Tanks 609 The three non-dimensional parameters P,F,a n d δ/δrare de fined as follows: P=UT w where U(m/s) is the maximum velocity of the liquid propellant at the baf fle location, T(s) is the natural period of oscillation, and w(m) is the width of the baf fle; F=w3 1 ( 1 - ν2 Et3 ) rho w2 T2f/parenleftBigw1 R/parenrightBig where w1(m) is the width of the flexible portion of the baf fle, w(m) is the width of the baf fle, νis the Poisson ratio of the baf fle material, E(N/m2)i st h eY o u n gm o d u l u s of the baf fle material, t(m) is the thickness of the baf fle, rho (kg/m3)t h ed e n s i t yo ft h e liquid propellant, f(w1/R)i sar a d i u sc o r r e c t i o nf a c t o r ,w h o s ev a l u ei sc l o s et ou n i t y for most applications, and R(m) is the radius of the cylindrical tank; δr 2π=2."
What does η(m) represent in relation to the oscillation measured at the tank wall?,"83/bracketleftBigw R/parenleftBig 2 - w R/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig 3 2/parenleftBigη R/parenrightBig1 2exp ( - 4.6d R ) where η(m) is the amplitude of oscillation measured at the tank wall from the free surface of the quiescent liquid, and d(m) is the depth of the baf fle below the free surface of the quiescent liquid."
What factors influence the maximum vertical velocity of the liquid propellant at the baffle location in a cylindrical tank?," The maximum vertical velocity Uof the liquid propellant at the baf fle location, due to the lateral oscillation (antisymmetric mode) impressed to the circular cylindrical tank, is given by the following equation of Sect. 6.5: 610 6 Tanks for Propellants U=1.841g ω1Rηsinh [ 1.841 ( h - z R ) ] cosh [ 1."
"What does the variable z represent in the equation provided, and how is it measured in relation to the free surface?","841 ( h R ) ] =ω1ηsinh [ 1.841 ( h - z R ) ] sinh [ 1.841 ( h R ) ] where h(m) is the height of the free surface of the quiescent liquid propellant, z(m) is the distance from the free surface of the quiescent liquid to any arbitrary depth (positive downward), and ω1(rad/s) is the first natural angular frequency of lateral slosh, whose value has been found in Sect."
"What is the equation for expressing P in terms of η, ω, h, and z using the provided parameters?"," 6.5to be ω1= [ 1.841g Rtanh ( 1.841h R ) ] 1 2 By substituting the preceding expression of UintoP=UT/wand remembering thatT=2π/ω1,t h ep e r i o dp a r a m e t e r Pcan be expressed as follows P=2πη wsinh [ 1.841 ( h - z R ) ] sinh [ 1.841 ( h R ) ] As shown in the preceding figure, Stephens and Scholl [ 20]c o n s i d e r e dv a l u e so f Pranging from 0."
What happens to the relative damping parameter as a baffle's flexibility increases beyond a certain point?,"6 to 2, the latter value being the highest attainable and having the appearance of a relatively severe slosh. The results found by Stephens and Scholl [ 20]i nt h e i re x p e r i m e n t a li n v e s t i g a t i o n on flexible and rigid baf fles can be summarised as follows: •the damping factor δprovided by a flexible baf fle is comparable to or greater than the damping factor δrprovided by a rigid baf fle in the same conditions of oscillatory flow; •the ef ficiency of damping per unit of weight of a flexible baf fle may greatly exceed that of a rigid baf fle; •as a baf fle becomes more flexible (that is, for increasing values of the flexibility parameter F), the relative damping parameter δ/δralso increases and reaches a maximum value, which depends on the value of the period parameter P;a n d •as the flexibility parameter increases further, the relative damping parameter δ/δr decreases rapidly to the point at which the baf fle opposes no resistance to the flow."
How does the liquid height affect the damping behavior of cruciform baffles in spherical or spheroidal tanks?," Cruciform baf fles are located in tanks in the same manner as stringers. This arrangement makes the damping provided by these baf fles in cylindrical tanks inde- pendent of the liquid height. Their behaviour has also been investigated in spherical or spheroidal tanks, where of course their damping depends on the liquid height."
What is the primary function of cruciform baffles in a tank when the tank is nearly empty?," Cruciform baf fles provide a smaller amount of damping than is the case with ring baf fles, except when a tank is nearly empty, in which case cruciform baf fles suppress rotatory motions and formation of vortices near the tank-drain outlet [ 7]. An example is given in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 21], which illustrates the liquid-oxygen tank of the S-II stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle."
What purpose do the ring baffles serve in the propellant tank design?," 6.6 Slosh-Suppression Devices for Tanks 611 Ac u t a w a yv i e wo ft h es a m et a n ki ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et ot h e courtesy of NASA [ 22]. 612 6 Tanks for Propellants The tank illustrated in the two preceding figures has ring baf fles attached to the skin stiffeners, which stabilise the tank wall and reduce sloshing."
What purpose do deflectors serve in relation to liquid motions in the described tank?, This tank has also ac r u c i f o r mb a f fl ea n da n t i - v o r t e xb a f fl e s( t h el a t t e rj u s ta b o v et h es u m p )a ti t sb a s e . De flectors have been placed above the surface of a liquid propellant in order to suppress the large-amplitude liquid motions which may be excited by an engine cut- off or by the pulsing of attitude-control engines during orbital coast.
What shape do deflectors take in propellant tanks to prevent liquid from reaching the vent?," De flectors are shaped as wide, inverted conical-ring baf fles. They prevent liquid propellant from reaching the tank vent, and facilitate propellant drainage. They also contribute, when submerged, to damp oscillatory motions [ 7]. Rigid lids, floating cans or porous mats have also been studied for propellant tanks."
What coverage percentage of the tank diameter is considered effective for rigid lids on a liquid propellant?, Such devices always act at the free surface of a liquid propellant. Rigid lids which cover part of the free surface of a liquid propellant and float up or down as the level changes in the tank have been found effective when they cover 85% or more of the tank diameter [ 8]. Floating porous mats have also been evaluated for the purpose of increasing viscous effects at the surface.
What is a potential issue with lids and covers in tanks for spacecraft?," Floating mats (left) and cans (right) are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 23]. 6.6 Slosh-Suppression Devices for Tanks 613 However, lids and covers may “hang up” on internal hardware of a tank, and therefore such devices have not been proved practical for spacecraft [ 8]."
What methods are used in tanks to transfer liquid propellants under low-gravity conditions?," Dividing a tank into radial or concentric compartments has also been used as a means to suppress sloshing motions for the lower frequencies of oscillations. This is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 23]. However, this solution has the drawbacks mentioned in Sect. 6.5. Positive-expulsion bags and diaphragms of elastomeric materials are used in tanks when it is necessary to transfer liquid propellants in low-gravity conditions or when al a r g e fl o wr a t ei sd e s i r e di nr o c k e te n g i n e sf e dw i t h o u tp u m p s ,a sh a sb e e ns h o w n in Chap."
What is the purpose of the membrane or diaphragm applied to the tank's wall?," 3, Sect. 3.5.T h e s ed e v i c e sp r o v i d ea ni m p e r m e a b l eb a r r i e rb e t w e e nt h e liquid and the gas contained in a tank. For this purpose, a membrane of elastomeric material or a flexible metallic diaphragm is attached around the wall of a tank at some section, as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 8]."
What must the membrane's size ensure in relation to the initial liquid quantity and remaining liquid expulsion in tanks?," 614 6 Tanks for Propellants The size of the membrane must be large enough to contain the initial quantity of liquid, and to expel nearly all the liquid which remains near the bottom of the tank. Stofan and Sumner [ 24]c o n d u c t e da ne x p e r i m e n t a li n v e s t i g a t i o nt oe v a l u a t et h e slosh-damping effectiveness of positive-expulsion bags and diaphragms in spherical tanks ranging from 0."
How do slosh forces correlate with excitation amplitude and diaphragm material thickness?,2413 to 0.8128 m in diameter. The positive-expulsion devices tested were made of butyl rubber and ranged from 0.254 to 1.016 mm in thickness. The excitation was impressed to the tank in the horizontal plane. The maximum slosh forces occurring at the first natural frequency increased with an increase in excitation amplitude and decreased as the thickness of the diaphragm material increased.
How does the thickness of diaphragm material affect the damping factor in terms of excitation amplitude?," The damping factor δwas found to be essentially independent of the excitation amplitude and increased with an increase in the thickness of the diaphragm material. The second natural mode force peak and the fluid swirl at the natural mode frequencies, which were observed for the unrestricted liquid sloshing, were completely suppressed [ 23]."
What shapes of tanks are commonly associated with slosh-suppression devices?," This type of slosh-suppression device has prevalently been used for spherical or oblate spheroidal tanks [ 8]. 6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks The properties of the metallic materials to be considered in the evaluation and selec- tion phases of a given programme have been identi fied by Wagner and Keller [ 22] as follows: 6."
What factors determine the suitability of materials used in the construction of tanks under various operational conditions?,"7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 615 •strength/weight ef ficiency under load/temperature conditions or under other critical failure conditions; •capability of being fabricated into the desired shapes and sizes without loss of their properties; •compatibility with all anticipated environments; •fracture toughness and resistance to subcritical flaw growth; •availability of shapes and sizes within required schedules; and •costs of materials and material processing and fabrication."
What are the principal strength properties essential for designing tanks in rocket vehicles?," These properties are discussed below. The principal strength properties to be considered in the design of tanks for rocket vehicles are ultimate tensile strength (Ftu), which governs ultimate burst pressure under ductile failure conditions; tensile yield strength ( Fty), to comply with the requirement of no yielding at limit load conditions or during proof testing; compressive yield strength ( Fcy), for compression- critical structures; and the elastic properties ( E,G,a n d ν)o ft h em a t e r i a l s ."
What properties are typically not critical in material selection but are significant for design details and mechanical attachments?,"F u r t h e r properties are ultimate shear strength ( Fsu), ultimate bearing strength ( Fbru), and bearing yield strength ( Fbry), which apply to design details, such as mechanical attachments, and are not usually important factors in the selection of materials. High- frequency, low-stress fatigue data are sometimes required to evaluate the effects of structural vibrations."
What factors can influence the mechanical properties of materials in tanks according to Wagner and Keller?," Low-frequency, high-stress fatigue data are often used to evaluate the effects of multiple pressurisation cycles. Wagner and Keller [ 22]h a v ea l s oi d e n t i fi e ds o m ev a r i a b l ep a r a m e t e r sw h i c hc a n affect the mechanical properties of the materials used for tanks. These parameters are temperature, thermal exposure, duration of loading, presence of biaxial and triaxial loads, rate of loading, and unusual environmental conditions such as corrosion and radiation."
What factors must be evaluated regarding the materials' design properties in relation to welding and loading directions?," The design properties of the materials are to be evaluated for the base metal, for the welds, and sometimes also for the weld zones exposed to heat. It is also necessary to consider the loading direction with respect to the grain orientation of the base metal, and the properties of the materials along and across the direction of the weld."
How do increased temperatures during processing affect the strength and ductility of metallic materials used in aerospace structures?," The effects induced on the properties of the materials by processing, forming, and heat treatments are also to be considered. The metallic materials used for structures of aerospace vehicles form the subject of the military standards MIL-HDBK-5J [ 25]. The welds form the subject of [ 26]. Ad e c r e a s ei nt e m p e r a t u r et e n d st oi n c r e a s et h es t r e n g t ho ft h em a t e r i a l ,b u t often decreases their ductility and toughness."
What must be ensured about the material used for tanks with cryogenic propellants in addition to increased strength at low temperatures?," In case of tanks containing cryogenic propellants, an increase in strength at low temperature is desirable, because it results in a mass reduction; however, it is also necessary in this case to ascertain whether the fracture toughness of the material of which the tank is made is adequate to the operational and proof-testing conditions."
How does prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures affect the strength of sensitive materials like certain titanium alloys?," Likewise, an increase in temperature tends to reduce the strength of the materials. This fact is to be considered for materials which are particularly sensitive to temper- ature, as is the case with some titanium alloys. Exposure of such materials to high temperatures for long periods of time can cause a permanent reduction in strength."
What type of deformation occurs in tanks due to prolonged pressurisation stresses?," 616 6 Tanks for Propellants Tanks for fluid propellants are required to withstand a high number (sometimes of the order of one hundred) of pressurisation cycles. Such cycles occur in testing and of course in service. Thank failures due to fatigue can occur as a result of these repeated cycles. Pressurisation stresses in tanks can also cause creep, which is a time-dependent deformation of a material subject to prolonged stresses."
How does multi-axial loading influence the mechanical characteristics of metals in pressurized tanks?," Creep usually occurs at high temperatures, but can also occur at moderately high temperatures for some titanium or aluminium alloys. The multi-axial loading of metals can have signi ficant effects on their mechanical properties. The bi-axial tensile stresses acting in pressurised tanks may in some cases improve, in other cases leave unchanged, and in other cases deteriorate the perfor- mance of the materials."
"What stress ratio typically results in maximum tensile strength increase for ductile, homogeneous, and isotropic materials?"," Materials which are ductile, homogeneous, and isotropic may show an increase in tensile strength, the amount of this increase depending on the bi-axial stress ratio. The maximum effects usually occurs at a bi-axial tensile-stress ratio of 2:1. As shown by experience, the magnitude of this effect is often of the order of that predicted by the von Mises criterion [ 27]."
What is the formula to calculate effective stress during multi-axial loading based on principal stresses?," According to this criterion, the effective stress for yielding σeffin a material element subject to multi-axial loading is σef f= [ (σ1 - σ2)2+(σ2 - σ3)2+(σ3 - σ1)2 2 ] 1 2 where σ1,σ2,a n d σ3are the principal stresses, that is, the stresses acting along three mutually orthogonal planes of zero shear stresses ( τ12=τ23=τ31=0)."
What yield criterion can be applied to titanium with preferred orientations that do not follow the von Mises criterion?," Anisotropic materials do not conform to the von Mises criterion. Such is the case, for example, with titanium processed in such a way as to obtain preferred orientations of the individual crystals or grains. For such materials, other yield criteria can be used, for example, the Hill 1948 criterion [ 28]."
Which criterion do some homogeneous and isotropical alloys conform to according to Wagner and Keller?," Further information on the Hill 1948 and other criteria for anisotropic materials can be found in [ 29]. In addition, Wagner and Keller [ 22]p o i n to u tt h a ts o m eh o m o g e n e o u sa n di s o t r o p i ca l l o y sd on o ta p p e a r to behave in full accordance with the von Mises criterion."
How does biaxial tension affect the strength and ductility of low-elongation materials in spherical tanks?," 6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 617 The strength of some materials may decrease when they are subject to biaxial tension. This effect may occur with low-elongation materials in a biaxial tensile- stress field. This state of stress is typical of spherical tanks, and limits the ductility of the material to the plane which includes its thickness."
What key quality is essential for materials used in designing tanks for aerospace vehicles?," In other planes, such materials in this state of stress tend to behave in a brittle manner [ 22]. The capability possessed by a material of being fabricated into the desired shapes and sizes without loss of its properties is one of the principal qualities considered in the design of tanks for aerospace vehicles."
What are the essential fabrication requirements for high-strength materials used to manufacture tanks?," This is because not all high-strength materials can also be manufactured economically to form tanks having the desired characteristics. Some essential fabrication requirements, indicated by Wagner and Keller [ 22], are indicated below: •availability in suitable forms, sizes, and levels of quality within the necessary schedules; •capability of being formed, and machined to the required con figurations, on the available equipment, and at the appropriate thicknesses and strength level; •capability of being welded to suit the common methods of assembly; and •capability of meeting thermal processing requirements."
What attributes should the fabrication method for a rocket engine tank possess according to Whitfield and Keller?," Some guidelines to be followed by a designer to choose a method of fabrication for a tank have been suggested by Whit field and Keller [ 30]. A brief account is given below. The method of fabrication chosen for a tank of a rocket engine should be reliable, rapid, and cost-effective for the particular case and needs of the programme to which it applies."
"What factors should be evaluated in selecting a fabrication process to balance schedule, cost, and reliability?"," A fabrication process should be selected so as to afford the best compro- mise between fabrication schedule and cost, without reducing reliability below a desired level. An engineering study should include trade-off evaluations of fabrica- tion and welding processes, reliability of various processes based on past experience, schedule effects of material processing, and cost connected with fabrication, tools, and facilities."
What factors influence the selection of materials and fabrication methods for pressure vessel components?," Ac o m p a r i s o no fm e t h o d so ff a b r i c a t i o nu s e df o rp r e s s u r e - v e s s e lc o m p o n e n t si s shown in the following table, taken from [ 22]. 618 6 Tanks for Propellants The size and the shape of a component and the aptitude of its material to be formed and machined are important aspects in choosing a material, a method of fabrication, and a heat treatment."
How does the size of a component affect the choice of fabrication methods and heat treatments?," For example, the large size of a component limits the methods of fabrication and the heat treatments which can be chosen. Speci fic information on the matter can be found in [ 31] (titanium and its alloys), [32] (stainless steel), and [ 33]( p r e c i p i t a t i o n - h a r d e n i n gs t a i n l e s ss t e e l ) ."
What are the key desirable characteristics of a metal that influence its weldability for tank construction?," The welding properties of a metal are of paramount importance in the choice of a metal for a tank. Desirable properties for a weldable metal are its capability of being fused without the formation of unwanted phases or constituents in or near the fusion zone, its ductility in the range from the melting temperature to room temperature (in order to resist cracking), strength, and fracture-resistance."
What welding process is suitable for producing high-quality work requiring minimal clean-up?," Generally speaking, according to NASA [ 34], the welding processes used for space flight hardware are: 6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 619 •Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW also known as MIG Welding), which is used for quickly fusing mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminium of various thicknesses; •Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding, which is used for carrying out work of high quality when a high standard of finish is needed without excessive clean-up by sanding or grinding; •Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), which is used for manufacturing, construction, and repair, and is well suited for heavy metal size 4 mm and upward; •Gas or Oxyacetylene Welding, which is commonly used for brazing soft metals such as copper and bronze, and for welding delicate parts of aluminium; and •Plasma Cutting, which is used to cut steel and other metals of different thicknesses for metal construction and maintenance."
What is the primary mechanism behind the Friction Stir Welding process in terms of heating and bonding?," Af u r t h e rp r o c e s s ,u s e ds p e c i fi c a l l yf o rt a n k so fl i q u i d - p r o p e l l a n tr o c k e te n g i n e s , is Friction Stir Welding (FSW), whose working principle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 35]. This welding process uses frictional heating combined with forging pressure to produce high-strength bonds virtually free of defects."
Who invented and patented the process of Friction Stir Welding?," Friction Stir Welding trans- forms the metals from a solid state into a plastic-like state, and then mechanically stirs the materials together under pressure to form a welded joint. This process was invented and patented by The Welding Institute (a British research and technology organisation), and has been applied to aerospace, shipbuilding, aircraft, and auto- motive industries."
For which series of aluminium alloys is friction stir welding primarily used for square butt joints?," In particular, it has been used primarily for square butt welds in aluminium alloys of the 2XXX series. Carter [ 35]h a sg i v e ns o m ee x a m p l e so fa p p l i c a t i o no fF r i c t i o nS t i rW e l d i n gt o the aerospace industry. They are •Space Shuttle external tank; •United Launch Alliance Delta II, Delta IV, and Atlas V; •Space X Falcon and Falcon 9; •Japan—JAXA H-IIB; and 620 6 Tanks for Propellants •NASA—Space Launch System core stage."
"What is a specific aluminium alloy that can be welded using the mentioned technology, which is unsuitable for fusion arc welding?"," One of the principal bene fits of this technology is that it allows welds to be made on aluminium alloys which cannot be readily welded by fusion arc. An example of such alloys is the Al–Li 2195 alloy, which has been used for the Super Light Weight Tank of the Space Shuttle. A further bene fit of Friction Stir Welding is that it has fewer elements than other welding techniques to control."
What are the three controllable variables in Friction Stir Welding?," In Friction Stir Welding there are only three process variables to control, namely, rotation speed, travel speed, and pressure, all of which are easily controlled. The increase in joint strength combined with the reduction in process variability resulted in an increased margin of safety and in a high degree of reliability for the external tank of the Space Shuttle."
What is the range of angular velocity for the dowel in Friction Stir Welding?," In Friction Stir Welding, a dowel rotates at an angular velocity between 19 and 31 rad/s [ 36], depending on the thickness of the material. The pin tip of the dowel is forced into the material under a pressure going from 3.4 ×107to 6.9 ×107N/m2 [36]. The pin continues to rotate and moves forward at a speed going from 1."
What temperature initiates plasticity in most materials during friction?,"48 to 2.12 mm/s [ 36]. As the pin rotates, friction heats the surrounding material and rapidly produces a softened plasticised area under the pin. Plasticity starts to occur around 700 K for most materials [ 37]. The temperature due to friction is carefully controlled not to exceed the point of turning the material to a liquid, which occurs at about 922 K in most cases [ 37]."
What distinguishes this forging process from fusion welding in terms of melting and material state?," As the pin travels forward, the material behind the pin is forged under pressure from the dowel and consolidates to form a bond at am o l e c u l a rl e v e l . Unlike fusion welding, no actual melting occurs in this process, and the weld is left in the same fine-grained condition as the original metal."
What function does the through-spindle retractable pin serve in the external tank of the Space Shuttle?," For the external tank of the Space Shuttle, a through-spindle retractable pin was developed, which can retract or expand its pin tip within the material. This allows for changes of thickness such as on the longitudinal barrel of the tank [ 36]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 37], shows retractable pin tools used for the Friction Stir Welding process."
What problem in friction stir welding does the retractable pin tool address?," Retractable pin tools were developed by NASA engineers because the original Friction Stir Welding left a opening, known as a keyhole, which was a point of weakness in the weld. The retractable pin tool retracts automatically when the weld 6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 621 is complete and prevents a keyhole."
"What requirements are generally necessary for high-carbon, low-alloy steel welds when the thickness exceeds a value of two?"," This improvement makes the weld stronger and eliminates the need to fill the keyhole during manufacturing. Apart from the choice of a particular welding technique, further processing, such as pre-heat or post-heat or both of them, is generally required for high-carbon, low- alloy steel welds when thickness is higher than 2."
What factors influence the need for pre-heat and post-heat in welding joints 2.5 mm thick or less?,"5 mm. However, pre-heat and post-heat may be required for welds of thickness equal to or less than 2.5 mm, in order to avoid weld cracking, depending on the material, on the welding process, and on the restraint characteristics of the particular weld. When pre-heat or post- heat is performed by using a torch, then oxidation can reduce the quality of the weld."
What materials are mentioned for backup tools used in controlling heat dissipation during welding?," To avoid this, automatic electric heating is desirable in many cases, because electric heaters controlled by rheostats provide appropriate temperatures and uniform heating. Backup tools made of copper, stainless steel, or refractory-covered metals are used to achieve either high, or low, or negligible heat dissipation, as the case requires, to control the final dimensions and properties of the weld [ 30]."
What approach is used to counteract the reduced strength of metal near welds?," A reduced strength of a metal in or near the welding zone can be compensated for by increasing its thickness at the joints. Since ductility decreases in the welding zone, then welds are generally located away from high-stress zones. Such zones are those in which ap a r a l l e lo ram e r i d i a no fas u r f a c eo fr e v o l u t i o nc h a n g e sa b r u p t l yi t sr a d i u so f curvature."
What welding processes can minimize residual stresses in welded zones to prevent issues in tank materials?," Residual stresses can still be present in welded zones, unless appropriate steps are taken. For this purpose, such processes as pressure welding and forge welding can reduce residual stresses to minimum values. Residual stresses should be relieved from materials used for tanks to avoid cracking, warping, and reduction of resistance to fatigue and fracture."
What is the purpose of ageing for the 18%-nickel maraging steel after welding?," To this end, such thermal processes as ageing for titanium and heat treatment for steel are applied. For example, the 18%-nickel maraging steel (so called because its strengthening mechanism consists in transforming the alloy to martensite with subsequent age hardening) requires ageing after welding to acquire maximum mechanical properties in welds [ 22]."
What is the primary reason for selecting specific materials for liquid-propellant rocket engine tanks?," Annealing is sometimes required before or during forming of tank components. However, many of the mate- rials commonly used for tanks do not require heat treatments after welding, either to restore mechanical properties or to relieve residual stresses. The materials which are chosen for tanks of liquid-propellant rocket engines must be compatible with the propellants contained."
What considerations should be made regarding metallic materials used for propellant tanks?," The following table, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22], shows causes and effects of reactions of metals with fluids. 622 6 Tanks for Propellants The metallic materials used for tanks should be considered alone or in combination with suitable types of protective finish. Such materials should also be resistant to the effects of exposure to all possible types of external environment."
What measures should be taken to safeguard metals for tanks from fluids or processes that could cause harm?," It is also necessary to prevent the deterioration or the contamination of metals used for tanks during their processing, manufacturing, inspection, test, transportation, and storage [ 22]. For this purpose, they must be protected from all fluids or processes which might have deleterious effects, as shown in the preceding table."
What impact can manufacturing treatments have on high-strength alloys?," In particular, many high-strength alloys may be to attacked or contaminated by fluids and treatments commonly used in the phases of manufacturing and process. This is because some fluids or treatments have given rise to undesirable chemical reactions, and must therefore be carefully checked before being used."
Which types of contamination affect titanium-based alloys during the manufacturing phase of rocket tanks?," Of the alloys commonly used for rocket tanks, those based on titanium have been found to be the most susceptible to contamination. Examples of contamination of such alloys in the manufacturing phase are 6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 623 •hydrogen contamination at room temperature or at high temperatures; •oxygen and nitrogen contamination at high temperatures; and •halogen contamination, resulting from halide-containing materials, before heat treatment or welding."
"What effect does contamination from hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen have on titanium's structural integrity?"," Titanium contaminated by hydrogen or oxygen or nitrogen becomes brittle. This undesirable effect, when due to heat treatments in air, can sometimes be removed by machining. However, when a titanium alloy is welded in air, then the entire weld becomes brittle. Steel can also become brittle when contaminated by hydrogen."
What effect does hydrogen contamination have on the strength and brittleness of steel and certain alloys in electrolytic processes?," This happens typi- cally in electrolytic processes. Steel becomes increasingly susceptible to contamina- tion due to hydrogen as its strength increases. Other type of alloys used for rocket tanks (such as aluminium alloys and alloys based on nickel and cobalt) may, or may not, become brittle in various degrees when contaminated by hydrogen, depending on temperature [ 22]."
What can occur to the materials of rocket tanks due to chemical reactions from contained fluids?," Fluids contained in rocket tanks can cause chemical reactions which results in either corrosion or reduced strength of the materials of which the tanks are made. This holds with both testing fluids and propellants. Fluids commonly used for testing purposes are not dangerous by their nature, but may become dangerous as a result of contamination."
What protects tank materials from reactions with corrosive or chemically reactive propellants?," Examples are tanks made of titanium alloys pressurised with methanol, or made of steel pressurised with water [ 22]. Some propellants are corrosive or chemically reactive. The containment of these propellants in tanks made of materials sensitive to chemical reactions is possible only when a film or a layer of stable oxide protects the covered material from further reactions."
What factors must be matched during testing to evaluate a material's susceptibility to chemical attack from a propellant?," In order to test the susceptibility of a given material to possible chemical attach due to a given propellant, it is necessary to conduct tests in the same conditions of pressure, temperature, and duration of exposure as those which will be experienced by the material in service. The decomposition of some propellants may be accelerated by the catalysing action exerted by some metals."
What types of substances can affect the external surface of a space vehicle during its operational life?," Examples of propellants subject to catalytic decomposition are hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine. At a n kw h o s ee x t e r n a ls u r f a c ei se x p o s e dt oa t m o s p h e r i ca g e n t sd u r i n gp a r to f the life of a space vehicle is subject to moisture, salts, and chemical substances of industrial origin."
What determines the resistance of certain metals used in tanks to atmospheric corrosion?," This part includes the times of manufacturing, storage, testing, transportation, and operation. Some metals used for tanks are resistant to atmospheric corrosion, because of the formation of a thin layer of protective oxide. Such is the case with titanium alloys, stainless steels and super-alloys having high percentages of nickel and chromium, and some aluminium alloys."
What types of interactions can occur between tank materials and contained fluids during service?, Other alloys and steels must be provided with a protective finish. The reactions which occur in conditions of service between the tank materials and the fluids contained can be classi fied as follows •stress-corrosion cracking; •galvanic corrosion; •loss of ductility due to hydrogen; and •ignition. 624 6 Tanks for Propellants Ab r i e fd e s c r i p t i o ni sg i v e nb e l o wf o re a c ht y p eo fr e a c t i o n .
What are the primary factors contributing to stress-corrosion cracking in high-stressed tanks?," According to the de finition given in [ 38], stress-corrosion cracking is a cracking process caused by the conjoint action of stress and a corrodent. Stress-corrosion cracking is one of the principal causes of failure of high-stressed tanks. Corrosion can be due to either the fluids contained in the tanks or the environments to which the tanks are exposed."
What factors influence the impact of stress-corrosion on materials in a given environment?," The most common of such environments is atmospheric air, which contains moisture, salts, and other chemical substances due to industrial processes. The effects of stress-corrosion on a given material depend on the stress sustained by the material, the degree of corrosion of the environment, and the time of exposure of the material to the environment."
What are three methods to prevent stress-corrosion cracking in tanks?, Means commonly used to avoid stress-corrosion cracking in tanks are •choice of materials resisting to corrosive environments or protection of susceptible materials from corrosive environments; •reduction of tensile stresses in materials exposed to corrosive environments; and •reduction of the times of exposure.
What does Table XIV of MIL-HDBK-729 specify regarding titanium alloys used for tanks and the related corrosive substances?," The matter of corrosion and protection of metals from corrosion forms the subject of the military standards MIL-HDBK-729 [ 39]. In particular, Table XIV on p. 127 of [39]i n d i c a t e st h ec h e m i c a lc o m p o s i t i o no fs o m et i t a n i u ma l l o y su s e df o rt a n k s , and the related corrosive substances, for which stress-corrosion cracking has been observed."
Which aluminium alloy series is prone to stress-corrosion in atmospheric conditions?," In particular, aluminium alloys of the 2XXX and 7XXX series are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking in atmospheric environments. Titanium alloys are normally resistant to atmospheric environments, but are susceptible to salt and other sources of chlorine which remain in contact with the metals at temperatures above about 561 K."
Which factors influence the susceptibility of titanium alloys to stress-corrosion cracking in different environments?, Some titanium alloys have also been found to be susceptible to sea water at room temperatures [ 22]. Ac o m p a r i s o no ft h er e s i s t a n c eo fv a r i o u sa l l o y st os t r e s s - c o r r o s i o nc r a c k i n gi n atmosphere and in other environments is given in Table VII on pp. 35 and 36 of [ 22].
"What is the term for the corrosion phenomenon involving dissimilar metals in an electrolytic solution, as defined by differences in their activity levels?"," Galvanic corrosion, so called after the Italian scientist Luigi Galvani, is an elec- trochemical phenomenon which occurs either on a macro-scale or on a micro-scale. On a macro-scale, it is the increased corrosion (deterioration) of the more active metal (anode) of a couple of dissimilar metals in an electrolytic solution or medium and the decreased corrosion of the less active metal (cathode) as compared to the corrosion of the individual metals, when not connected, in the same electrolytic environment."
What is an example of a solution that can conduct electric current?," By electrolytic solution, we mean a solution capable of conducting an electric current. An example is common sea water. The dissimilarity which provides the driving force to galvanic corrosion is the difference in the electrode potential of each of the two metals when they are in elec- trical contact through the electrolyte."
What does electrode potential indicate regarding a metal's activity compared to another metal in an electrolyte?, Electrode potential is a measure of the tendency of a metal to become more active than another metal when they are immersed in a given electrolyte. Ag a l v a n i cs e r i e si sal i s to fm e t a l sa n da l l o y sb a s e do nt h e i ro r d e ra n dt e n d e n c yt o corrode independently in a particular electrolytic solution or in other environment.
Which material listed is considered noble in the galvanic series when placed in sea water?," 6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 625 Ag a l v a n i cs e r i e si ns e aw a t e r ,d u et ot h ec o u r t e s yo fN A S A[ 40], is given below. This series is arranged in order of increasing activity. Galvanic Series In Sea Water Noble (least active) Platinum Gold Graphite Silver 18-8-3 Stainless steel, type 316 (passive) 18-8 Stainless steel, type 304 (passive) Titanium 13 percent chromium stainless steel, type 410 (passive) 7Ni-33Cu alloy 75Ni-16Cr-7Fe alloy (passive) Nickel (passive) Silver solder M-Bronze G-Bronze 70-30 cupro-nickel Silicon bronze Copper Red brass Aluminium bronze Admiralty brass Yellow brass 76Ni-16Cr-7Fe alloy (active) Nickel (active) Naval brass Manganese bronze Muntz metal Tin Lead 18-8-3 Stainless steel, type 316 (active) 18-8 Stainless steel, type 304 (active) 13 percent chromium stainless steel, type 410 (active) Cast iron Mild steel Aluminium 2024 Cadmium Alclad Aluminium 6053 Galvanised steel Zinc Magnesium alloys 626 6 Tanks for Propellants Magnesium Anodic (most active) When galvanic corrosion occurs on a macro-scale, the anodic and cathodic areas are easily discerned."
What factors can contribute to micro-scale galvanic corrosion in metals?," On a micro-scale, galvanic corrosion may occur with one metal having dissim- ilarities (for example, impurity inclusions, grains of different sizes, difference in composition of grains, differences in mechanical stress), abnormal level of pH, and high temperatures [ 41]. When galvanic corrosion occurs on a micro-scale, the anodic and cathodic areas can only be discerned by metallographic techniques or deduced by inference or observations of the corroded metal [ 39]."
What is the primary reason galvanic corrosion is generally not a concern in liquid-propellant rocket engines?," Galvanic corrosion can occur within a tank containing an electrically conductive fluid, or outside a tank exposed to atmospheric moisture. Generally speaking, in liquid-propellant rocket engines, galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals is of little or no concern, because most propellants either have little electrical conductivity, or do not develop signi ficant electrode potentials in contact with normal structural metals, or both [ 22]."
What issues can occur when untested propellants are combined with contaminants?," However, this problem may arise when new or inadequately tested propellants are used either alone or in the presence of contaminants, or when liquids other than propellants (for example, water) are in contact with dissimilar metals. Metals can be protected from corrosion by providing them with a coating or a treatment."
What are the various types of coatings mentioned for protecting specific metals?," The coating may be a paint, a sealant, a resin coating, or a metallic coating. Several types of coatings, used to protect speci fic metals, are described at length in [42]. The treatment may be a surface or bulk treatment, a chemical or mechanical treatment, or a combination of these. Some metals effectively resist corrosion damages because of their ability to form and maintain, when exposed to an aggressive environment, an adherent and imper- vious film."
What is the primary purpose of applying protective coatings to common metals used in tanks?," These metals are said to have become passivated. However, many of the common or structural metals used for tanks are either scarcely ef ficient or unable in producing such protective films. Consequently, protective coatings or treatments are applied to many common metals to prevent or reduce corrosion [ 39]."
What is the term for the phenomenon where metals lose ductility in the presence of hydrogen due to absorption and diffusion?," Metals which are in contact with pure hydrogen should be evaluated for suscepti- bility to loss of ductility in the presence of hydrogen. This phenomenon, also known as hydrogen-assisted fracture, is due to the easy absorption and subsequent diffusion of hydrogen into metals. On a microscopic scale, hydrogen atoms tend to segregate in certain parts of the crystal lattice of a metal, thereby weakening its chemical bonds."
What happens to the walls of a metallic container holding hydrogen?," Consequently, the walls of a metallic tank containing hydrogen become brittle, which can lead to failure. The compatibility of metals with hydrogen has been investigated by several authors. Some of them are Cataldo [ 43], Caskey [ 44], San Marchi and Somerday [45], and Chandler [ 46]. A brief account is given below."
Which type of alloys primarily exhibits increased brittleness from hydrogen exposure?," Brittleness of metals due to hydrogen occurs principally in ferrous alloys, such as high-strength and martensitic steels. In most cases, the greater the strength of a metal, the more susceptible it is to brittleness caused by hydrogen. Low-strength metals, such as copper, aluminium, and nickel alloys, have low susceptibility to 6."
What is the impact of strain-hardening on the brittleness of certain metals in relation to hydrogen damage?,"7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions of Tanks 627 hydrogen damage. However, in case of these metals having undergone a strain- hardening process, there would be a greater risk of induced brittleness. In some cases, steels and alloys of low strength can be used to decrease the risk of loss of ductility."
What is the relationship between the reduction in notch strength and the ambient strength of the material according to the provided information?," However, of course, the metal chosen must withstand the loads applied to it during operation. In quantitative terms, the following table, adapted from [ 43], shows the effects induced by gaseous hydrogen, at a pressure of 6.895 ×107N/m2,i nv a r i o u sa l l o y s . As has been anticipated above, the reduction in notch strength resulting from the preceding table is inversely related to the ambient strength of the material, but there are exceptions to this rule."
Which materials are preferred for tanks holding propellants due to their resistance to ignition and violent reactions?," For example, the A-286 stainless steel (an age-hardened iron base superalloy) has a high yield strength, but an apparent low susceptibility to hydrogen. The best alloys are aluminium alloys, copper, and stabilised stainless steels [ 43]. The materials which are used for tanks containing propellants should not be susceptible to ignition or to violent reactions in the presence of the propellants."
What factors should be considered to prevent ignition when using materials for tanks?," Consequently, titanium and titanium alloys should not be used for tanks containing oxidisers such as red fuming nitric acid, liquid oxygen, pressurised gaseous oxygen, mixtures of liquid oxygen and liquid fluorine, and other strong oxidisers. It is also necessary to consider the possibility of ignition due to impact, rupture, friction, elec- tricity, heat, or any other source of highly concentrated energy."
Which materials are advised against using in tanks for hydrazine and related propellants?," This holds in particular 628 6 Tanks for Propellants with titanium and titanium alloys in contact with oxidisers [ 22]. For the same reason, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, and other alloys which contain free elements should not be used with hydrazine or with other propellants related to hydrazine. As a general rule, it is necessary to ascertain the compatibility of the materials used for tanks with the propellants (in liquid and gaseous phases) to be contained in them, before such materials come in contact with the related propellants."
What can flaws in materials used for tanks lead to regarding load capacity and lifespan?, 6.8 Fracture Control of Metals Used for Tanks Tanks and other pressure vessels containing propellants may have flaws or defects which are either present in the original materials before processing or induced in the materials by processes of fabrication. These defects can reduce the capability of carrying loads and the operational life of the tanks.
What happens to tanks with large defects when they are subjected to pressure tests?," When such defects are large in comparison with those causing failure, then failure occurs as soon as the tanks are put under pressure for test purposes. When such defects are small, the tanks may withstand several cycles of pressure loading for a considerable number of hours before the size of the defects grows to such an extent as to cause failure."
What criteria are presented for designing metallic tanks to minimize failure risks during testing and operation?," It is necessary, for reasons of economy, to reduce the possibility of failure of tanks used for a space vehicles during testing. It is mandatory, for reason of both safety of the crew and economy, to reduce the possibility of failure of such tanks during operation. The present section presents criteria and practices to be used in the design of metallic tanks for propellants, in order to reduce the possibility of failures caused by defects during test, pre- flight, and flight."
What must be true about the initial sizes of flaws compared to the critical sizes to avoid failures during testing?," For this purpose, it is necessary to consider: •the initial sizes of the flaws; •the critical sizes of the flaws (meaning by that, the sizes required to cause fracture at a given level of stress); and •the subcritical characteristics of the flaws which can cause their growth. To prevent failures during test, the initial sizes of the flaws must be less than the critical sizes at the level of stress given to the material in test phase."
What factors influence the critical size of a flaw in a tank?," To prevent failures during service, it must be proven that the largest possible size of an initial flaw in a tank cannot grow to the critical size during the required operational life of the tank. The critical size of a flaw depends on the level of stress, on the toughness of the material to fracture, on the thickness of the wall, and on the location and direction of the flaw."
What kind of inspection methods limit the determination of a flaw's initial size?," The determination of the initial size of a flaw is limited by the available methods of non-destructive inspection. However, further information may come from the results of a successful proof test. In other words, a proof test in which a tank has not failed provides information on the maximum possible value of the ratio of the initial to critical stress level."
What factors influence the growth of subcritical flaws in metals used for tanks?," This value, in turn, makes it possible to estimate the maximum possible size of the initial flaws. 6.8 Fracture Control of Metals Used for Tanks 629 The growth of subcritical flaws depends on the stress level, the initial size of the flaws, the material, the environment, and the pressure applied as a function of time to a given tank."
What type of flaw causes a tank to fail during testing when its size exceeds a certain critical limit?," Examples of flaws which are rarely detected in metallic tanks or in other pressure vessels are surface flaws and internal flaws. When a tank has an initial flaw whose size exceeds the critical size at the level of stress applied in testing, then the tank fails just in phase of testing. A tank fails in service, when the size of an initial flaw is less than the critical size at the level of stress applied in testing, but this size grows due to the stress applied in service to such an extent as to reach the critical size at the level of stress applied in service."
What factors influence the critical dimensions of surface and internal flaws in a tank's wall before reaching leakage?," When the size of an initial flaw grows through the thickness of the wall of a tank before reaching the critical size, then leakage occurs. In the elastic field of stress, the critical sizes of surface and internal flaws depend on the critical value KIc(Pa m 1/2 ,w h e r e1P a =1N / m2)o ft h ef r a c t u r et o u g h n e s s of the material, and on the level of the stress applied."
Define thick-walled and thin-walled tanks based on the relationship between flaw sizes and wall thickness. What is the significance of critical sizes in this context?," When the critical sizes of the flaws are small in comparison with the thickness of the wall, then a tank is said to be thick-walled. Otherwise, when the critical sizes of the flaws approach or exceed the thickness of the wall, then a tank is said to be thin-walled. The critical sizes of surface flaws in uniformly stressed thick-walled tanks can be calculated by using the following equation of [ 47]: ( a Q ) cr=1 1."
What parameter is defined as Q=φ² - 0 in the calculation of critical sizes of small internal flaws?,"21π ( KIc σ ) 2 The critical sizes of small internal flaws in uniformly stressed thick-walled tanks can be calculated by using the following equation of [ 47]: ( a Q ) cr=1 π ( KIc σ ) 2 In the two preceding equations, a(m) is the minor semi-axis of the ellipse of equation x2 c2+y2 a2=1 that is, a(m) is the depth of the semi-elliptic surface flaw, 2 c(m) is the length of the semi-elliptic surface flaw, Qis the flaw-shape parameter de fined as follows Q=φ2 - 0."
What is the expression for the modulus k used in the calculation of the elliptic integral?,"212 ( σ σys ) 2 φis the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, of modulus k=(1 - a2/c2) 1/2 , de fined as follows 630 6 Tanks for Propellants φ(k)=π 2/integraldisplay 0 ( 1 - k2sin2θ ) 1 2dθ=π 2/integraldisplay 0 ( 1 - c2 - a2 c2sin2θ ) 1 2 dθ θ(rad) is an angular variable of integration, σ(N/m2) is the uniform gross stress applied at in finity in a direction perpendicular to the plane of crack, and σys(N/m2) is the uniaxial tensile yield strength of the material."
What does the equation (a/Q)cr=(KIc/σ)²/(1.21 π) represent in relation to flaw characteristics?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 47], shows the relationship between the flaw-shape parameter Q and the flaw depth-to-length ratio a/(2c). The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 47], is a graphical representation of the preceding equation ( a/Q)cr=(KIc/σ)2/(1.21 π)."
What is necessary to determine critical flaw sizes and operational life of thin-walled tanks or pressure vessels?," 6.8 Fracture Control of Metals Used for Tanks 631 By the way, the complete elliptic integral of the second kind can be evaluated numerically by using the following expansion [ 48]: φ(k)=π 2 [ 1 - ( 1 2 ) 2k 1 - ( 1·3 2·4 ) 2k2 3 - ( 1·3·5 2·4·6 ) 2k3 5 - ··· ] where | k|<1 . In order to predict critical flaw sizes, failure modes, and operational life of thin- walled tanks or pressure vessels, it is necessary to know the stress intensity for flaws which become very deep with respect to the wall thickness."
What percentage of material thickness is considered accurate for the given equation regarding semi-elliptic surface flaws?," The solution given by the preceding equation (a/Q)cr=(KIc/σ)2/(1.21π)for a semi-elliptic surface flaw has been found to be suf ficiently accurate for flaw depths up to about 50% of the thickness of the material [ 47]. For flaws of greater depths, the intensity of the stress applied is magni fied by the effect of the free surface near the flaw tip."
What does the magnification factor indicate about the critical value of fracture toughness in thin-walled tanks?," In other words, in thin-walled tanks, the flaw-tip stress intensity can reach the critical value KIcat a flaw size smaller than that which results from the preceding equation (a/Q)cr=(KIc/σ)2/(1.21π). The effect of the magni fication factor MKon the critical value KIcof the fracture toughness of a material is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [47]."
What is the significance of the parameter MK in determining critical fracture toughness for deep surface flaws?," 632 6 Tanks for Propellants The magni fication factor MKis applied to the equation (a/Q)cr= (KIc/σ)2/(1.21π)as follows KIc=1.1MKπ1 2σ ( a Q ) 1 2 cr This application determines the critical value of the fracture toughness in case of deep surface flaws (such that the value of a/(2c)i ss m a l l ) . As shown in the preceding figure, the value of MKhas been found to vary from less than 1."
What is the range of values for semi-circular imperfections compared to deeper long flaws in tanks?,"1 for semi-circular flaws ( a=c,a n dt h e r e f o r e a/(2c)=0.50) to 1.6 for flaws having smaller values of a/(2c). In case of tanks having flaws which are long with respect to their depth ( Q≈1), the following equation can be used for a thin-walled tank KIc=1.1MKπ1 2σa1 2 and the following equation can be used for a thick-walled tank KIc=1."
What values can be obtained from laboratory tests to predict critical sizes for flaws in a tank?,"1π1 2σa1 2 In order to predict the critical sizes for surface and internal flaws by using the preceding equation (a/Q)cr=(KIc/σ)2/(1.21π),i ti sn e c e s s a r yt ok n o wt h ev a l u e s ofKIcfor the original material and for the welds of a tank. These values can be obtained from laboratory tests. 6."
What method is necessary to identify actual initial flaw sizes in tanks?,"8 Fracture Control of Metals Used for Tanks 633 In order to prevent failure in a tank, either the actual initial flaw sizes or the maximum possible initial flaw sizes must be known. Non-destructive inspection is the only means of determining the actual initial flaw sizes. A successful proof test provides a measure of the maximum possible initial-to-critical stress intensity ratio, and this in turn makes it possible to estimate the maximum possible initial flaw sizes."
What are the inspection methods mentioned for evaluating rocket tanks?," Non-destructive inspection techniques commonly used for rocket tanks are radio- graphic testing, ultrasonic testing, liquid penetrant testing, and magnetic particle testing. Other techniques are eddy current testing and infrared testing [ 47]. When multiple inspection techniques (for example, radiographic testing, ultra- sonic testing, and liquid penetrant testing) are used, then most surface and internal flaws are detected."
What types of flaws are particularly challenging to identify during inspections?," However, it is not safe to assume that all existing flaws can be detected at any time, because some of them (for example, tight cracks) are particu- larly dif ficult to detect. The largest initial flaw sizes which cannot escape detection cannot be established with con fidence. The inspection techniques commonly used do not measure precisely the lengths and the depths of the initial flaws to be used in a fracture mechanics analysis."
What is the primary non-destructive inspection method mentioned that helps ensure tanks do not have initial flaws?," However, it is necessary to rely on non-destructive inspection to prevent proof-test failures of most high-strength tanks [ 47]. Proof-pressure testing is probably the most reliable non-destructive inspection technique available to ensure the absence of initial flaws of suf ficient sizes to cause failure of a tank in operating conditions."
What is the maximum possible value of the ratio of the plane-strain stress-intensity factor at initial conditions to the fracture toughness when conducting a proof test?, Let KIi(Pa m 1/2 )a n d KIc(Pa m 1/2 )b er e s p e c - tively the plane-strain stress-intensity factor at the initial conditions and the fracture toughness of a given material. A successful proof test conducted at a pressure of αtimes the maximum pressure in operating conditions indicates that the maximum possible value of the ratio KIi/KIcis equal to 1/ α.
What influences the allowable value of the ratio KIi/KIc for a tank's required service life?,"T h i sv a l u ec a nb eu s e dw i t h subcritical flaw-growth data to estimate the minimum life of a tank. From the point of view of the initial design, the minimum required proof-test factor αfor a tank is α=1 allowable value of the ratio KIi/KIc The allowable value of the ratio KIi/KIcdepends on the required service life of the tank and on the subcritical flaw-growth properties of the material [ 47]."
What factors may cause local stress levels in a tank to exceed the yield strength of its material during proof testing?," In order to prevent yielding in proof testing, the membrane stresses applied to a tank are limited to a value equal to or less than the yield strength of the material. In practice, the local level of stress may exceed the yield strength of the mate- rial, because there may be discontinuities due to design or manufacturing, and also because of the presence of residual stresses."
What happens to the critical flaw size when the applied stress exceeds the material's yield strength?," When the applied stress approaches and exceeds the yield strength of the material, the critical flaw-size curve deviates from the theoretical curve based on a constant value of KIc,a n dt h e r e f o r et h ec r i t i c a l flaw sizes are smaller than those predicted by the linear-elastic theory of fracture mechanics."
What should the minimum operational life of a tank exceed when the stress at proof pressure surpasses the material's yield strength?," When the stress applied to a tank at proof pressure exceeds the yield strength of the material and the tank also passes the proof test, then the maximum possible value of the ratio KIi/KIcresulting from the test is smaller than 1/ α.I nt h i sc a s e , 634 6 Tanks for Propellants the minimum operational life of the tank should exceed the required life, which has previously been used to determine α."
What factors influence the proof-test value in relation to wall thickness and material fracture toughness?," In is to be observed that the equation α=1/(allowable value of the ratio Kii/Kic), which expresses the required minimum proof-test factor αfor a tank, does not take account of the thickness of the tank. However, the value of the proof test in providing assurance against failure in service changes with decreasing wall thickness or with increasing fracture toughness KIcof the material [ 47]."
What factors influence the selection of fluid for a proof test in relation to alloy performance?," When a proof test is performed at a temperature which differs from the temperature in operating conditions, then the required minimum value of the proof-test factor is expressed by the following equation of [ 47]: α=1 allowable KIi/KIcat operating temperature×KIcat proof - test temperature KIcat operating temperature The choice of the proper fluid to be used in a proof test is an important consid- eration for all alloys."
What fluids can be used to mitigate the detrimental effects of water in high-strength alloys?," Water may have a detrimental effect in high-strength alloys, because it promotes slow growth of flaws due to the effect of hydrogen cracking. This problem has been solved by using either other fluids, such as oil, or water with corrosion inhibitors, such as sodium bichromate (Cr 2Na2O7), or distilled water."
What factors can lead to the growth of a subcritical flaw in a tank?," Subcritical flaw growth can occur after cyclic loading, sustained-stress loading, and combined cyclic and sustained-stress loading. Data from fracture specimen tests can be used in a fracture mechanics analysis to predict the number of cycles or the time needed for an initial flaw in a tank under sustained pressure to grow to critical size."
What does the ratio KIi/KIc influence regarding the failure of a heat-treated Ti-6Al-4V alloy in air?," The time or the number of cycles needed to cause failure has been found to depend primarily on the ratio KIi/KIc. The following figure, adapted from [ 47], shows the ratio KIi/KIcversus cycles to fracture for a heat-treated Ti-6Al-4V alloy in air at room temperature. The quantity Ris the ratio of the minimum stress to the maximum stress during a cycle."
What phenomenon is observed in sustained-stress experiments regarding flaw growth in materials in specific environments?," Both the best- fit, least-square curve and the 96% probability, 99% curve are shown in the plot. 6.8 Fracture Control of Metals Used for Tanks 635 An important property observed in all sustained-stress experiments of flaw growth is the existence of a threshold level of stress intensity for a given material in a given environment."
What is the significance of the specific stress intensity value KTH in relation to flaw growth in materials?," In other words, below a given value of stress intensity (or of KIi/KIcratio), flaw growth has not been detected. Above this value, flaw growth occurs and can result in fracture. This stress intensity has been designated as KTH. The discovery of a unique value of KTHfor a given material in a given environment makes it possible to design a safe tank subject to a sustained load."
What factors influence the threshold value of KTH for a Ti-6Al-4V alloy in different environments?," KTHmay be 80% of KIcor higher in an inert environment, but may also be less than 50% of KIcin a hostile environment. The threshold value KTHfor a Ti-6Al-4V alloy subject to sustained load in two different liquids (distilled water and methanol) is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 47]."
How does the thickness of a specimen affect the values determined for KTH in crack tests?," The value of KTHhas been found to decrease with increasing yield strength in steel alloys. The flaw growth for sustained load has the highest values in conditions of plane strain. The values of KTH,d e t e r m i n e df r o mt e s t so fs p e c i m e n sc r a c k e dt h r o u g h the thickness, increase with decrease in specimen thickness."
How does the crack growth rate behave with increasing stress intensity in chemically inert environments?," In chemically inert environments, the crack growth rate initially decreases with increasing stress intensity. When the initial stress intensity is suf ficiently low, the crack may halt. At higher stress intensities, the crack growth rate passes through am i n i m u mv a l u ea n dt h e ni n c r e a s e ss t e a d i l yu n t i lt h ec r a c kb e c o m e su n s t a b l e ."
What types of alloys exhibit two thresholds in various environments according to the observations made?," This behaviour has been observed for AM 350®steel (a heat-treatable austenitic or martensitic alloy, depending on heat treatment) in a puri fied argon environment. For some alloys, such as Ti-5Al-2.5Sn (ELI) and 2219-T87, two thresholds have been observed in environments of room air, liquid nitrogen, and liquid hydrogen."
What distinguishes the two specified threshold stress intensities regarding flaw growth and its occurrence?," One of these threshold stress intensities was de fined as the value of stress above which flaw growth to failure can be expected. The other of them was de fined as the value of stress below which there is no flaw growth. In the interval between these 636 6 Tanks for Propellants two threshold intensities, small amounts of flaw growth can occur, but the growth apparently arrests after a short time at load [ 47]."
What are the identified criteria for designing metallic tanks used in rocket engines according to Tiffany?," Some examples of ratios KTH/KIc,d e t e r m i n e de x p e r i m e n t a l l y ,a r es h o w ni nt h e following table, adapted from [ 47]. 6.8 Fracture Control of Metals Used for Tanks 637 Some criteria to be observed in the design of metallic tanks for rocket engines have been identi fied by Tiffany [ 47]."
What factors must be considered in the design of tanks to prevent failure and ensure low catastrophic failure probability?," They may be summarised as follows. All tanks must be designed to avoid failure in service caused by flaws and to ensure a very low probability of catastrophic failure caused by flaws during proof tests. For this purpose, it is necessary to consider not only the internal pressure to which a tank is subject, but also the pressures, temperatures, environments, and stresses to which the tank is exposed."
What sources are mentioned for ensuring the appropriate characteristics of fracture-growth and flaw-growth in tank materials?," The materials used for tanks must have appropriate characteristics of fracture- growth and flaw-growth. These characteristics must come from reliable sources of data, for example, from the military standards MIL-HDBK-5 J [ 25], and must also be con firmed by tests. The critical flaw sizes must be determined for the stress levels of interest by either analysis or tests, as appropriate."
What should the maximum size of initial flaws in tanks be relative to the critical size during proof pressure?," If possible, the maximum size of initial flaws allowable in tanks should be so great as to be detected by non-destructive inspection, but not so great as to grow to critical size during life in service. The allowable initial size of flaws must be less than the critical size at the level of stress of proof pressure."
What is the purpose of selecting the initial stress intensity ratio in a tank's design?," The initial stress intensity ratio allowable in a tank must be chosen to ensure that the critical intensity ratio is not attained during the design life of the tank. Each tank must be proof tested. The level of proof pressure must be chosen to demonstrate that the tank is free of flaws larger than the allowable initial size, or that the actual initial stress-intensity ratio is less than the allowable initial stress-intensity ratio."
What factors should be considered to prevent failures during proof tests?," Account must be taken of the differences between the proof test temperature and the service temperature, and of the time required to apply or remove pressure during the proof test. In order to prevent failures in proof tests, low levels of stress and materials having high values of fracture toughness must be used during such tests."
What are the desirable characteristics for ensuring safe performance during proof testing of tank walls?," By so doing, the critical sizes of flaws are large and greater than the thickness of the tank walls. Consequently, the worst case which can occur during proof testing is leakage. In order to obtain maximum assurance of safe performance in service, it is desirable to use large proof-test factors, low levels of operational stresses, and materials having low rates of flaw growth under cyclic loads and high values of KTHin the expected environment of service."
What are the main structural elements included in the evaluation of tank design?," On the other hand, the use of large proof-test factors, low levels of operational stresses, and materials having high values of fracture toughness leads often to high masses of tanks. Therefore, trade-offs can and should be made to arrive to an optimum compromise for a given tank. 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks The structural elements considered in the present section are tank shells, weld joints, access openings, support fittings, and accessory attachment provisions."
What types of pressures must tank components endure during propellant servicing or decontamination?," 638 6 Tanks for Propellants Not only the tank shells but also the other elements are required to withstand internal and external pressures, the latter acting during propellant servicing or during decontamination. Vacuum is frequently used to remove gas from the liquid side of expulsion devices (described in Sect."
What is the required external pressure that tank shells must withstand?," 6.6), and also to remove residual propellants from tanks. The tank shells and the other elements are required to withstand an external pressure of one atmosphere (101325 N/m2). One of the principal requirements of tanks for rocket engines is low mass. Other requirements are cost, schedule times, easiness of manufacturing, reliability and availability of the materials used for them, technical skills of the personnel, tools, and testing facilities."
What elements are included in the detailed design phase of a tank's structure?," In the phase of structural design, the detailed design of a tank includes sidewall, fore and aft bulkheads, access openings, and accessory mounting provisions. The design of these elements depends on the material chosen for the tank. The detailed design of a tank also includes the primary structural junctures."
What is the term for the maximum stress a tank structure is expected to withstand under specified operating conditions?," The design of a tank is based on the relation between the loads imposed and the capability of the tank to withstand such loads. Wagner and Keller [ 22]h a v ei d e n t i fi e d the following factors to be taken into account in the analysis of the loads imposed on a tank: •limit load or stress, which is the maximum stress or pressure which the tank struc- ture is expected to bear, in the speci fied operating conditions and with allowance for possible variations; •design safety factor, which is a multiplier, whose value (greater than unity) is chosen by the designer to take account of small variations of the properties of the material, of the quality of manufacturing, and of the magnitude and distribution of the load in the structure; •design load or stress, which is the limit load multiplied by the design safety factor; •allowable load or stress, which is the load not to be exceeded to avoid failure, the latter being due to either buckling, or yield, or ultimate loading; and •margin of safety ( ms), which is the fraction by which the allowable load exceeds the design load, as follows ms=allowable load or stress (limit load or stress )×(design safety factor ) - 1 The magnitude of the design safety factor depends on the degree of con fidence in the properties of the materials, on the processes of production, and on the validity of the predicted conditions of use."
What are the typical ranges for the design safety factor used for yield and ultimate stress in rocket vehicle structures?," In practice, a uniform design safety factor is chosen by the designer for the entire structure of a rocket vehicle on the basis of experience and judgement. Values in use for the design safety factor range from 1.0 to 1.1 for yield stress and from 1.25 to 1.5 for ultimate stress, the higher values being used for manned flight vehicles."
What types of stresses must the structural elements of a rocket tank endure?," The structure of a rocket tank is required to withstand the stresses due to vibration, thermal shock, propellant slosh, and internal pressure. This structure is also required 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 639 to provide the load path for the loads acting on the body of the rocket vehicle. The structural elements of a rocket tank are subject to different types of stresses, which are brie fly described below for each element."
What types of forces and moments affect the tank sidewall of the S-IVB stage?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 49], shows schematically the structural elements of the S-IVB (the third stage of the Saturn IV launch vehicle), which has one J-2 engine. The tank sidewall of a tank is subject to pressure, inertial forces due to the propel- lant, axial loads, and bending moments."
What factors contribute to the calculation of circumferential stresses in a storage tank?," The circumferential stresses are determined by combining the ullage pressure, the load pressure, and the inertial force due to the propellant. The meridian stresses are determined by combining the ullage pressure, the axial loads, and the bending moments. The stresses acting on the end closures of a tank result from the ullage pressure and the acceleration impressed on the propellant."
What factors must be considered to evaluate stress at a specific location on end closures of tanks during boost time?," During the boost time, the aft bulkheads of tanks have a maximum pressure at the apex, and the forward bulkheads have a minimum pressure at the apex. In order to evaluate the stress at a speci fic location on the end closures, the pressure and the shape of the closure must be considered. When there are separate bulkheads on two contiguous tanks, the load acting on each of them is to be determined as indicated above for end closures of tanks."
What determines the pressure loads at specific locations on a common bulkhead in tanks?," 640 6 Tanks for Propellants As i n g l ec o m m o nb u l k h e a di ss u b j e c tt oe i t h e rb u r s to rc o l l a p s el o a d sa n dt o temperature gradients through its thickness. The pressure loads acting at any given point of a common bulkhead are determined as described above for end closures of tanks, but a common bulkhead is subject only to the difference between the forward pressure and the aft pressure acting at any given point."
What design feature enhances stability against collapsing pressure loads in bulkheads?," The stability under collapsing pressure loads is obtained by designing a bulkhead of large bending stiffness in comparison with its membrane stiffness. A stiffened skin for a tank requires a more complex analysis of internal loads. In this case, a multi-layer shell of revolution is frequently used. At a n ki sa l s os u b j e c tt ol o c a ll o a d sa ta n yp o i n ti nw h i c hi ti sm a t e dt oo t h e r components of a rocket vehicle."
What factor influences the magnitude and direction of loads on structural elements?, The magnitudes and the directions of these loads depend on the weight of each component multiplied by an ampli fication factor due to acceleration and vibration. The magnitude of these loads is felt to its full extent by the attachment bolts and by the immediate structural elements. It is felt to a lesser extent by the contiguous structural elements.
What criteria are used to evaluate the lower magnitude of damping in structures away from the excitation point?," This lower magnitude is evaluated according to criteria suggested by experience and judgement, taking account of the damping which occurs away from the point of excitation. In most cases, tanks for liquid-propellant rocket engines are thin-walled surfaces of revolution, meaning by that, structures whose thickness tis assumed constant and much smaller than the radii Rof curvature of its middle surface [ 2]."
What assumption allows for the use of simplified formulas for calculating stress and strain in materials?," In practice, the value of R/tis assumed greater than 10. As has been shown in the first four sections of the present chapter, this assumption permits the use of simple formulas for stress and strain, such as those which are given in [ 3]. The choice of the materials and the evaluation of the corresponding thicknesses and stresses can be done by using only data on mechanical properties with safety factors selected by the designer."
What factors must be evaluated before making a preliminary choice regarding materials in manufacturing?," Of course, practical considerations concerning manu- facturing, handling, and stiffness are also taken into account in this preliminary choice. Before this choice can take place, the level of stress in working condition, the thickness of the skin, and the fracture strength of the materials must be evaluated."
What characteristics must a proposed material have to meet life service requirements for a tank?," The proposed material must possess appropriate values of toughness and resistance to the growth of subcritical flaws, in order to comply with the requirements of life service for a given tank. After a material has been chosen, the proof-test stress, the operational stress, and the non-destructive inspection requirements are de fined according to the desired mission performance."
What factors influence the determination of skin thickness for a tank's sidewall?," The skin thickness is determined by taking account of the most restrictive conditions, such as safety factor, criteria of fracture control, manu- facturing, and handling. The skin thickness for the sidewall of a tank depends on the product of the circumferential tension load under the predicted maximum pressure times the factor of safety [ 22]."
What effect does internal pressure have on the structural integrity of thin-walled tanks during flight?," In order to reduce mass, the skin thickness should be as low as possible. There are several methods for constructing thin-walled tanks. Sometimes, a tank can be put under internal pressure to keep its walls from buckling. This is because the net tensional force due to internal pressure is made greater than the compressional force due to the flight loads."
What method is utilized in conventional aircraft construction to stabilize thin metallic sheets?," Consequently, the tank is only subject to tension, and buckling is avoided. Such was the case with the Atlas and Centaur launch vehicles, in which additional membrane rigidity was obtained through the internal 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 641 working pressure within the tank [ 22]. Another method of stabilising thin metallic sheets is used in the construction of conventional aircraft."
What structural elements are fastened to the skin to handle compressive loads in this method?," In this method, stiffening members (stringers) are fastened to the skin in the direction of the compressive loads, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 50]. The same result can also be obtained in a single piece of metal by chemically milling or machining a solid sheet to remove all metal except ribs or waf fles which act as stringers, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 50], which illustrates a rectangular waf fle structure."
What geometric shape is used for the arrangement of ribs in an isogrid structure?," Still another method (developed by McDonnell Douglas) of stiffening a skin is the use of an isogrid structure, in which the ribs are arranged in a repetitive equilateral triangular pattern, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 51], where an isogrid structure (left) and a square waf fle structure (right) are illustrated."
What structural features are employed to enhance buckling resistance in tank sidewall skins?," 642 6 Tanks for Propellants An isogrid structure results in a surface whose stiffness is orthogonally isotropic. Details and methods of calculation for isogrid structures are given in [ 49]. This method was used for the external skin structure of the Delta launch vehicle [ 51]. Summarising, the sidewall skin is usually stiffened against buckling by using stringers, frames, or ribs spaced in a grid pattern (either isogrid or rectangular waf fle)."
What are the principal types of designs for pressurized tanks in large space vehicles?," The sidewall design is particularly important for tanks of large space vehicles. This is because the sidewall in such vehicles not only contains the propellant but also transmits the body loads. The principal types of sidewall designs for tanks under pressure are skin-stringer-frame, grid, and monocoque."
What design is typically used for a tank with a highly loaded sidewall?," The choice of one or another type of design for a tank depends on the magnitude of the body loads applied externally and on the type of propellant to be contained in the tank. A highly loaded sidewall is usually designed with the skin-stringer- frame structure, whereas a lightly loaded sidewall is designed with the waf fle or isogrid structure."
What type of design is best suited for propulsion tanks to reduce leakage risks?," A very lightly loaded sidewall can be designed with the monocoque structure, but pressurising is often required for stability. Integral stiffening is the type of skin-stringer design which is best suited to propel- lant tanks [ 22]. This type of design eliminates the many sources of possible leakage associated with the points of mechanical attachment involving the skin, the stringers, and the frames constructed in the conventional manner."
What is the primary construction method used for the “blade” stringer design as described in the figure?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22], shows two types of skin-stringer designs. They are: (a) “Blade” stringer; and (b) “T” stringer. The type (a), shown on the left-hand side of the preceding figure, consists of panels in which the skin, the “blade” stingers, and the horizontal ribs are machined as an integral unit, where the frames are attached mechanically to the horizontal ribs after the panels are formed."
What is the fabrication method used for panel type (b) involving skin and stringers?," 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 643 The type (b), shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure, consists of panels in which only the skin and the “T” stringers are machined, and the frames are added after forming by mechanical attachment to the inboard flanges of the “T” stringers [ 22]. The thickness of the skin depends on the circumferential tensional loads under maximum internal pressure."
What factors influence the configuration and spacing of stringers in tank design?, The stringer spacing depends on the local requirements of stability. The stringer con figuration and the frame spacing for tanks of minimum mass depend on general requirements of stability under axial compressive loads combined with internal pressures. The material used for a sidewall of skin-stringer-frame design must be readily machinable and must also have good forming and welding properties.
Why should the thickness increase at weld joints in design?," Compensation should be made by increasing the thickness at the weld joints, because the design strength of a weld is generally taken lower than the strength of the original material. The stringer spacing should be designed so as to keep the skin from buckling at limit load, account being taken of the buckling data of the curved panel and also of the stabilising effect of the internal pressure."
What design feature is used to enhance the stiffness of a fuel tank's skin?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22], shows a typical sidewall design used successfully for the liquid-hydrogen tank of the Saturn S-II stage. 644 6 Tanks for Propellants As has been shown above, the skin of a tank can also be stiffened by using integral ribs spaced in a grid pattern (either isogrid or rectangular waf fle)."
What methods are mentioned for forming integral rib stiffeners from thick plates?, The integral rib stiffeners are usually formed by mechanical or chemical milling of the waf fle pattern in a thick plate. Mechanical milling is more ef ficient than the other method [ 22]. The waf fle structure is usually designed according to criteria of shell stability. Aluminium alloys are frequently used for the waf fle plate material.
What was the orientation of the pockets in the S-IVB stage relative to the vehicle's longitudinal axis?," Aw a f fl ed e s i g nw a su s e df o rt h ep r o p e l l a n tt a n ks t r u c t u r eo ft h eS a t u r nS - I V B stage. The waf fle pattern of the S-IVB consisted of pockets 241.3 mm on centre, which were oriented ±π/4 rad with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. These pockets were surrounded by ribs which were 15."
What is the thickness of the weld land areas at the edges of the segments in the described structure?,"93 mm high and 3.658 mm wide. The skin or web thickness at the bottom of the pocket was 3.124 mm, and the weld land areas at the edges of these segments were 6.4 mm thick. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 52], shows the propellant tank structure of the Saturn S-IVB stage and, in particular, the machined waf fle pattern."
What are the advantages of the isogrid pattern compared to rectangular or square patterns in structural design?," 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 645 The isogrid pattern has the following advantages over the rectangular or square pattern: •high twisting rigidity of the structure, which distributes the loading over a wide region; •isotropic behaviour of the material, which has the same strength in all directions; and 646 6 Tanks for Propellants •uncoupling of the bending and the in-plane resultants."
What does the isogrid pattern allow for in the analysis of structures?," Therefore, the isogrid pattern makes it possible to apply the many available solu- tions of the classical theory of plates. In other words, a structure stiffened by an isogrid pattern can be analysed as a solid continuous sheet of material having appropriate thickness and elastic modulus [ 49]. Am o n o c o q u es t r u c t u r es t a b i l i s e db yi n t e r n a lp r e s s u r eh a st h el o w e s ts t r u c t u r a l mass."
What must the meridian tensile stress exceed to prevent buckling in a specific pressure-stabilised structure?," This type of structure requires a material having a high tensile stress. Extreme care must be taken during manufacturing and transportation to avoid handling damage. In order to prevent buckling in a monocoque pressure-stabilised structure, the meridian tensile stress due to internal pressure must be greater than the meridian compressive stress due to external loads."
What type of structure is utilized for the Atlas and Centaur launch vehicles and the Space Shuttle's liquid-oxygen tank?," This type of structure has been used for the Atlas and Centaur launch vehicles. It has also been used for the liquid-oxygen tank of the Space Shuttle, which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 53]. The shape of the end closures of tanks affects their lengths and also the means used for structural stiffening, to an extent which depends on the materials chosen."
What is a common type of closure for two tanks positioned one above the other?," Ac h o i c es h o u l da l s ob em a d eo nw h e t h e ru s i n gt w os e p a r a t ec l o s u r e so rac o m m o n closure for two tanks stacked onto each other. Some surfaces of revolution, which have been analysed by computer subroutines for end closures, are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]."
What shapes were used for end closures of the Titan and Saturn S-IV tanks?," 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 647 In practice, end closures of hemispherical shape were chosen for the tanks of the Titan and for those of the Saturn S-IV. Oblate spheroids were chosen for the Saturn S-II, and ellipsoids were chosen for the Atlas, the Saturn I-C, and the Centaur [ 22]. As a n d w i c hs t r u c t u r ei su s e dt or e s i s tb u c k l i n gi nt h ep r e s e n c eo fc o m p r e s s i v e loads."
In what situations are monocoque structures applicable for use?," Where only tensional loads exist, monocoque structures can be used. An example of honeycomb sandwich structure is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]. 648 6 Tanks for Propellants Further information on sandwich structures is given in several textbooks. A short course on the matter can be found in [ 54]."
What type of stresses must be carefully determined to avoid circumferential buckling in the forward bulkhead of a tank?," The forward bulkhead of a tank is usually a surface of revolution, convex on its external side, which is loaded principally by internal pressure. A thin skin subject to membrane stresses is the structural scheme generally used. Compressive stresses should be carefully determined, especially where the radius of curvature of the surface of revolution changes, in order to avoid circumferential buckling, and the results found analytically should be con firmed by tests."
What is the purpose of varying the shell thickness in relation to the bulkhead’s allowable stress?," To reduce mass, it is desirable to vary the thickness of the shell so that the bulkhead is subject to the maximum allowable stress along its meridians. On the other end, to reduce cost, it is desirable a shell of constant thickness. As has been shown in the preceding figures of this section, a bulkhead is generally manufactured by welding together an apical tank skin (also known as the dollar hatch) to a welded sub-assembly consisting of some triangular segments or gores."
What distinguishes the aft bulkhead of a tank from the forward bulkhead in terms of force action?," This method avoids the juncture of the multiple welds where the gore segments meet at a common point. 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 649 The aft bulkhead of a tank differs from the forward bulkhead only because some forces can act on it under certain conditions. For example, such forces act during the filling of a tank with a liquid propellant and during the propelled flight."
How are the fuel and oxidiser separated in a bi-propellant rocket engine?," Aft bulkheads are constructed by using sandwich or waf fle structures. Engine feed-lines are usually located in the central part of a bulkhead, in case of a single engine. The fuel and the oxidiser of a bi-propellant rocket engine are separated by either two distinct bulkheads or one common bulkhead, according to the scheme shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]."
What type of structures are typically utilized for a common bulkhead designed to withstand both bursting and collapsing pressures?," Ac o m m o nb u l k h e a d ,i fp r e s e n t ,m a yb ee i t h e rs e l f - s u p p o r t i n go rp r e s s u r e - stabilised. A common bulkhead of the self-supporting type must be designed for both bursting and collapsing pressures. Sandwich or waf fle structures are generally used for this purpose."
What types of attachment junctures are utilized in a tank for storing propellants?," The forward surface of a common bulkhead is usually convex, as shown in the preceding figure. The attachment junctures used in a tank for propellants include: •weld joints; •bulkhead/sidewall juncture; and •bosses and support provisions. Ab r i e fd e s c r i p t i o ni sg i v e nb e l o wf o re a c ho ft h e s ee l e m e n t s ."
What modifications are required at weld joints due to the decreased strength of the material in the weld area?," The principal welding processes used in space flight hardware have been described in Sect. 6.7.W ed e s c r i b eh e r et h ew e l dj o i n t su s e ds p e c i fi c a l l yi nt a n k sf o rp r o p e l l a n t s . Since the strength of the material in the weld area is less than the strength of the original material, then an increase in thickness is necessary at the weld joints."
Why is maintaining a smooth outer surface at a weld joint important in the context of aerodynamics?," The thicker weld land ( tweld>tskin)i su s u a l l ya s y m m e t r i c a lo nt h et w os i d e s( e x t e r n a l and internal) of the skin at a weld joint, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]. 650 6 Tanks for Propellants This is because it is desirable to maintain a smooth external surface for aerody- namic reasons, and also because milling on the two sides of a weld land is more expensive than milling on one side only."
What is the range for the width of a weld land used in the construction of propellant tanks?," The preceding figure illustrates two types, (a) and (b), of weld land for aluminium alloys 2014-T6 and 2219-T87, which are materials commonly used for propellant tanks. The thickness tweldof a weld land is greater, by a factor ranging from 2 to 2.25, than the thickness tskinof the skin. The width dof a weld land ranges from 32 to 51 mm."
What is the primary benefit of a tapered termination compared to an abrupt termination in weld land design?," The stepped or tapered termination (type b) of a weld land has the advantage, over the abrupt termination (type a), of avoiding bending stresses and strength reduction where the skin meets the weld land [22]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22], shows some pre-weld joint preparations which have proven satisfactory for tank design."
What manufacturing method is preferred for cylindrical sections of tanks to avoid longitudinal welds?," 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 651 When possible, cylindrical sections of tanks are manufactured by spin forging, in order to eliminate longitudinal welds. Post-weld processing of tanks is limited to ageing, to relieve internal stresses caused by welding. This is because heat treat- ments after welding could induce distortion and oxidation, and also because complex equipment would be needed for that effect."
"What type of fitting, commonly used in specific tanks, is shaped like a ""Y"" and has historical applications in the Saturn I-C and Titan II?"," Junctures are also needed in a tank between bulkhead and sidewall and between skirt and sidewall. These junctures are usually made at a common location with an appropriate fitting. A fitting commonly used is a Y-ring, so called due to its shape, which has been used for the Saturn I-C and for the Titan II."
What type of rocket stage utilized the Y-ring fitting and the different types of fittings for the bulkhead/sidewall junction?," A Y-ring fitting is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]. 652 6 Tanks for Propellants Ad i f f e r e n tt y p eo f fi t t i n gf o rt h eb u l k h e a d / s i d e w a l lj u n c t u r ei ss h o w ni nt h e following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]. It was used for the Centaur rocket stage."
What primary function does the assembly provide regarding load distribution and leak prevention?, AY - r i n g fi t t i n gp r o v i d e sas t r u c t u r a lp a t hf o rt h el o a d sf r o mt h eb u l k h e a dt o the tank and from the skirt to the tank. It also makes the tank leak-proof at the bulkhead/sidewall juncture. The system components and the tank mounting structure are usually attached by means of bosses.
How are bosses integrated with the basic structure if the latter is a thin shell?," Such bosses are made deep enough to accommodate mechanical 6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks 653 fasteners, in order to avoid tank penetration. When the basic structure is of suf ficient thickness, then the bosses are integrally milled with the basic structure. When the basic structure is a thin shell, then the use of integral bosses requires a material of larger initial thickness and a more extensive milling."
What welding process-related issue arises from fabricating bosses on the bulkhead using a circular machined ring?," Bosses can also be fabricated by welding a circular machined ring, containing the bosses, to the bulkhead. However, this method induces residual stresses in the material as a result of the welding process. Non-integral support provisions are machined fittings, such as ports, flanges, and support pads, which are welded to the tank skin."
What must be done to maintain strength when welding tank skins?," For this purpose, it is necessary to provide a material whose thickness is greater than the thickness of the tank skin, in order compensate for the loss of strength due to welding. Otherwise, for the same reason, it is necessary to lower the permissible operating pressure of the tank. In tanks for liquid propellants, a single access opening is frequently used."
What is the purpose of connecting inlet lines to standpipes in multiple tanks?," This is obtained by using a close-out cover which contains the lines for input and output. When multiple tanks are connected in series, the inlet lines are connected to standpipes within the tanks, in order to preclude reverse flow of propellant and to ensure feed-out in series. Openings and access doors are ports and access points in the skin of a tank."
What design feature is used in method (a) to minimize rotation at the joint due to eccentric bolt shear loading?," Three examples are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 22]. Openings and access doors are usually located in or near the apex of a bulkhead. The primary requirements for these access points is the prevention of leakage during the entire service life of a rocket vehicle. The method marked with (a) in the preceding figure uses a door with a bearing lip and oversized holes, in order to reduce rotation at the joint because of eccentric bolt shear loading."
What configuration is utilized for the forward door of the Centaur rocket stage?," The method marked with (b) uses ab u l k h e a db o s so fl a r g ec r o s s - s e c t i o n a la r e a ,i no r d e rt of o r c em o s to ft h el o a dt o remain in the bolting ring instead of going through the door. The method marked with (c) uses a door ring placed above the apex of the bulkhead, and has been chosen for the forward door of the Centaur rocket stage."

What elements are mentioned as part of the interconnecting structures and fluid-carrying ducts in this chapter?,"pdf Chapter 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures 7.1 Fundamental Concepts The present chapter describes interconnecting structures and fluid-carrying ducts which incorporate elements such as bellows, flexible joints, flexible hoses, and flanges. An example is provided by the propellant-supply ducts which convey the fuel and the oxidiser from their tanks in a rocket stage to the respective turbo-pumps."
What flexible components do these ducts utilize to allow movement during engine gimbal adjustments?," These ducts employ flexible components (hoses, bellows, and joints) to permit freedom of movement during engine gimballing. Some typical assemblies for lines, bellows, and hoses are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], which illustrates the J-2 engine, used for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles."
What is the purpose of filters in the ducts of a liquid-propellant rocket engine?," ©T h eE d i t o r ( s )( i fa p p l i c a b l e )a n dT h eA u t h o r ( s ) ,u n d e re x c l u s i v el i c e n s e to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines , Springer Aerospace Technology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_7657 658 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures The ducts of a liquid-propellant rocket engine have often filters, which maintain the fluids at a desired level of cleanliness, by removing contaminant particles which such fluids may contain."
What is the term for a sealed passage used to transport fluid between parts of a rocket engine?," A de finition of the principal terms used in this chapter is given below. A line or duct is an enclosed leak-proof passageway through which a fluid is conveyed from one component of a rocket engine to another. A bellows is ac y l i n d e r ,c o r r u g a t e da l o n gi t ss i d e w a l l ,w h i c hm a yb ee n c l o s e di nal i n et op e r m i t movement by de flection of its corrugations."
What is the purpose of a flexible hose in fluid transfer?," A bellows joint may be either a bellows with a restraint linkage or a free bellows alone. A flexible hose is a bendable duct used to carry or transfer a fluid from one point to another. A flange is a rib or rim placed at one end of a duct for attachment to another piece or duct. A flange joint is an attachment of ducts, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together."
What are the reasons for utilizing flexible ducts over rigid ducts according to Howell and Weathers?," A filter is a device which removes a contaminant from a fluid by 7.1 Fundamental Concepts 659 trapping particles of the contaminant within or on the surface of a porous material. According to Howell and Weathers [ 2], flexible ducts are considered for use instead of rigid ducts under any of the following conditions: •existence of angular or lateral misalignment of the points to be connected; •necessity of removing ducts for repair or replacement; •occurrence of relative motion caused by thermal expansion, duct movement, or structural bending; and •presence of severe vibration."
What is the function of the ducts in a rocket engine as described in the document?," The principal interconnecting ducts and structures in a rocket engine are described in Sect. 7.2.T h ef o l l o w i n g s e c t i o n sd e s c r i b em a t e r i a l s ,c o n s t r u c t i o n ,d e s i g nc r i t e r i a , and methods of calculation. 7.2 Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket Engine Propellant-supply ducts convey the fuel and the oxidiser from their tanks to the respective turbo-pumps."
What is the main objective for the ducts supplying propellant in terms of pressure?," These ducts, due to their location at the centre of an engine gimbal, are subject to bending and torsional loads. They are also subject to internal pressure, due to the fluids carried by them. The principal requirement for propellant- supply ducts is to keep the pressure losses between the tank outlets and the pump inlets to the minimum possible value."
What are the potential drawbacks of internal and external restrainers in ducts regarding pressure losses and interference with engine components?," As a result of the many forces acting upon these ducts, restrainers against buckling are frequently required. Such restrainers, if located inside the ducts, contribute to undesired pressure losses. On the other hand, the external location of the restrainers increases the duct size and may create problems of interference of the ducts with other components of the engine."
What type of device is designed to absorb rotational deformation within a pump inlet duct?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], shows a bellows of the compressed type, externally restrained against buckling. 660 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], shows an anti-buckling device designed to absorb torsional de flection in a pump inlet duct."
What issue prompted the incorporation of a bellows assembly in the pump inlet ducts of the J-2 engine?," 7.2 Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket Engine 661 The device shown above is a tightly formed bellows assembly, which was incor- porated into the pump inlet ducts of the J-2 engine, when the torsional moment of the ducts was found to be too high for the resistance of the pump casing. The bellows is thin-walled (0."
What is the height of the stacked deep corrugations mentioned in the description?,"254 mm) and over 2540 mm long. It has 40 deep corrugations stacked in a 31.75 mm height. Flanges encompass the bellows and permit the application of only torsional de flections. The joint is substantially a torsion spring of low elastic constant, which can absorb torsional rotations up to π/60 rad or 3° [ 1]."
What information is necessary for the manufacturer regarding the gimballed engine ducts in a rocket vehicle?," The manufacturer of a rocket vehicle must know the sizes of the connecting flanges, the types of gasket used, and the forces transmitted by the engine ducts to the vehicle when the engine is gimballed. This information is provided by the engine designer. In pump-feed rocket engines, the working relative pressure of propellant- supply ducts ranges from 0."
What is the maximum allowable working absolute pressure for propellant ducts in pressure-fed rocket engines?,"3447 ×106N/m2to 0.6895 ×106N/m2and over. In pressure-fed rocket engines, the working absolute pressure of the propellant ducts is less than 3.447 ×106N/m2[3]. In rocket engines fed by turbo-pumps, the high-pressure propellant ducts for pump discharge connect the outlet sections of the pumps (for respectively the oxidiser and the fuel) to the main fuel valves attached to the thrust chamber."
What materials were used to replace bellows joints in the pump discharge ducts of early F-1 engines?," These ducts also contain bellows components. However, some engines have also had rigid (instead of flexible) components, as shown in following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]. The early F-1 engines incorporated bellows joints in the pump discharge ducts, but these joints were later replaced by hard lines of aluminium with large bends for flexibility."
What configuration is commonly used for pump discharge ducts in gimballing engines?," The low modulus of elasticity of aluminium permitted lower end reactions for a given de flection than did a comparable duct of steel or nickel-base alloy. This change was possible because the ducts were not gimballing and were required to absorb only misalignments and thermal effects. 662 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures In case of gimballing engines, a classic con figuration for pump discharge ducts is the wraparound duct arrangement, which is shown in following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]."
What type of flexible component encircles the thrust-vector-control mechanism in rocket engines?," The term wraparound indicates a flexible duct or hose which, as it were, wraps around the thrust-vector-control gimbal of a rocket engine in the plane of the gimbal. This con figuration was used for the Navaho, Atlas, Thor, and Jupiter engine pump discharge ducts, for the pump inlet ducts of the H-1 engine, for the gimballing feed lines of the Apollo Service Module engine, and for the descent engine of the Apollo Lunar Module."
"What specific configuration was used for the vehicle-to-engine interface lines of the F-1 engine on the S-IC, excluding the primary propellant lines?"," This con figuration was also used for all of the vehicle-to-engine interface lines of the F-1 engine on the S-IC, except the main propellant lines. In addition, the wraparound concept was used extensively for each of the three main engines of the Space Shuttle. Details on the matter can be found in [ 1,4]."
What are the components of the described high-pressure propellant duct?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], shows a typical pump- discharge high-pressure propellant duct with restraining linkage. 7.2 Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket Engine 663 The duct shown above has two bellows separated by a spool piece. This type of duct is subject to vibration of the long unsupported mass."
What component in the oxidiser high-pressure duct acts as a thrust compensator in the J-2 rocket engine?," The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], shows a bellows thrust- compensating linkage with external tie bar installed in the oxidiser high-pressure duct of the J-2 rocket engine. This duct has an external tie bar which acts as a thrust compensator, and two bellows held together by the external tie bar, which limits the movements of the two bellows."
What is the function of the pressurisation lines connected to the propellant tanks?," One bellows opposes the other in balancing the pressure exerted by the propellant flowing in the duct. Pressurisation lines for the propellant tanks are used to connect the propellant tanks to sources of pressures, such as gases stored under pressure, gas generators, and heat exchangers for cryogenic propellants."
What type of high-pressure flexible hoses were utilized for the Saturn I-B rocket stage?," For this purpose, high-pressure hoses and tubing are used. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 5]. shows two 6.35 mm, 34.6 MPa (relative pressure) flexible hoses, which were used for the Saturn I-B rocket stage. 664 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Seal drain lines are often used in case of dynamic seals applied to the shafts or to other moving components of turbo-pumps."
What components are included in the seal drain lines used between dynamic seals?," Since perfect sealing is dif ficult to obtain, then drain lines are used between two dynamic seals placed in series. The seal drain lines, which include flexible hoses and tubing, are routed away and overboard. In case of a combination of liquid oxygen with RP-1, the seal drain lines can be routed along the wall of the thrust chamber up to the exit plane of the nozzle."
Where are the seal drain lines directed during boost flight?," In case of combinations of propellants which can form highly explosive mixtures, these lines are routed to vent ports at the periphery of space vehicles. The seal drain lines are usually routed to the periphery of the vehicles during boost flight, and to the exit of the thrust chamber during stage operation [ 3]."
What precautions are taken regarding liquid hydrogen leaks inside a rocket vehicle to prevent accumulation?," Seal drains for liquid hydrogen are routed to a safe disposal area, because of the hazard of mixing liquid hydrogen with atmospheric air. Therefore, leaking hydrogen is not allowed to accumulate inside a rocket vehicle. For liquid-hydrogen turbo- pumps, the external drains are usually eliminated, and the seal leakage is allowed to vent into the turbine area, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 6], which illustrates a particular of the liquid-hydrogen turbo-pump used for the J2-S engine."
What functions do pneumatic supply lines support in a rocket engine?," 7.2 Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket Engine 665 Pneumatic supply lines are used in rocket engines to provide pneumatic pressure required for several purposes. For example, as described at length in [ 4], the pneu- matic control assembly of the Space Shuttle provide central control of all pneumatic functions, such as: •engine preparation and shutdown purges; •bleed valve operation; and •engine pneumatic shutdown, including pogo post-charge."
What factors influence the design of high-pressure flexible lines in pneumatic systems?," The pneumatic pressure is provided by gases stored in vessels, which are charged before flight through high-pressure flexible lines. The design of such lines depends on the mating connexions on the vehicle side, on the type of gas used, and on its temperature and pressure. Cryogenic-propellant bleed lines are used in cryogenic-propellant engines feed by turbo-pumps."
What factors contribute to the adverse conditions for engines during the startup phase?," This is because adverse conditions for such engines may occur during start, when the metallic walls containing cryogenic fluids are at insuf ficiently low temperatures, and also when the cryogenic fluids downstream of the tank outlet are superheated. In addition, the pressure which opens the main valves and starts the turbo-pumps reduces further the static pressure at the inlet of the turbo-pumps, and this accelerates the production of gas."
What is the purpose of continuous bleed from a location farthest downstream of the pump inlet?," This, in turn, may lead to cavitation in the pumps and to malfunction of the gas generator. In order to avoid such undesirable events, a continuous bleed from a point farthest downstream of the pump inlet is applied before engine start. By so doing, fresh liquid at the bulk temperature of the tank replaces continuously the warming fluid and cools the metallic walls of the containers."
What materials are typically utilized for lines that channel away bleeds from the launch site?," The bleeds are ducted away from the launch site, because they can form combustible or even explosive mixtures. This 666 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures requires a line to duct away the bleeds. Wire-braided flexible hoses and tubing are generally used for such lines. In case of cryogenic-propellant engines used for upper stages of rockets, a re-circulation system is used, which re-directs the propellants to their tanks instead of dumping them overboard."
What methods can be implemented to maintain propellant temperatures below their boiling points in a rocket vehicle?," Flexible lines between the engine and the rocket vehicle are required for this purpose. In order to reduce bleeds and re-circulating flows, it is possible to provide the rocket vehicle with means (such as cooling, thermal insulation, etc.) apt to keep the bulk temperatures of the propellants suf ficiently below their boiling temperatures at the operating pressures in the tanks."
What is the purpose of using non-reactive gases during the operation of rocket engines?," Purge lines are required for rocket engines. This is due to the necessity of performing purges during the start and shutdown sequence, and also before and after servicing, to keep the engines dry. These purges are executed by using non-reactive gases, such as nitrogen at ambient temperature, in order to prevent the formation of combustible mixtures, and to expel residual propellants."
What is the purpose of applying heated nitrogen in the space between the engine and its envelope?," As an example, for the F-1 engine, a gaseous nitrogen purge is applied for thermal conditioning and for elimination of explosive mixtures under the engine envelope. Since low temperatures may exist in the space between the engine and its envelope for thermal insulation, then heated nitrogen is applied to this space."
What condition prompts the manual operation of the purge regarding the ambient temperature and the substance onboard?," This purge is manually operated, whenever there is a prolonged hold of the countdown with liquid oxygen onboard and with an ambient temperature below approximately 286 K. This purge is turned off five minutes prior to ignition command and is continued during the time of umbilical connexion. Ac o n t i n u o u sn i t r o g e np u r g ei sa l s or e q u i r e dt oe x p e lp r o p e l l a n tl e a k a g ef r o mt h e seal housing of the liquid-oxygen turbo-pump and from the liquid-oxygen injector of the gas generator."
What role does the purging gas play in relation to the liquid-oxygen seal and radiation calorimeter?, The pressure of the purging gas improves the properties of the liquid-oxygen seal. This purge is required from the time at which the propellants are loaded and is continuous throughout flight. An i t r o g e np u r g ep r e v e n t sc o n t a m i n a n t sf r o ma c c u m u l a t i n go nt h ev i e w i n g surfaces of the radiation calorimeter.
What is the purpose of the purge that begins 52 seconds prior to lift-off?, This purge is started 52 s before scheduled lift-off time and is continued during flight. Ag a s e o u sn i t r o g e np u r g ei sr e q u i r e dt op r e v e n tc o n t a m i n a n t sf r o me n t e r i n gt h e liquid-oxygen system through the liquid-oxygen injector of the main engine or the liquid-oxygen injector of the gas generator.
What is the purpose of the ethylene glycol solution filled in the thrust tubes and manifolds before engine start?," This purge is started prior to engine operation and is continued during the time of umbilical connexion. At approximately 13 h before scheduled lift-off time, an ethylene glycol solution fills the thrust tubes and the manifolds of the engine. This inert solution serves to smooth out the combustion sequence at engine start."
What is the volume supplied approximately 5 minutes before scheduled lift-off to compensate for liquid loss?," Flow is terminated by a signal from an observer at the engine. At approximately 5 min before scheduled lift-off time, 186.3 l (0.1893 m3)are supplied to top off the system to compensate for liquid loss which occurred during engine gimballing [ 7]. Hydraulic ducts for high-pressure liquids are used in liquid-propellant rocket engines, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 7], which illustrates the outboard engine fluid system used for the five F-1 engines of the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V rocket."
What is the purpose of gimbaling the four outboard engines in the S-IC during the burn phase?," 7.2 Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket Engine 667 The flight control system of the S-IC gimbals the four outboard engines to provide attitude control during the burn phase of the S-IC. For this purpose, the hydraulic pressure is supplied from a Ground Support Equipment (GSE) pressure source during test, pre-launch checkout, and engine start."
What components control the sequencing of the engine valves during system startup?," When the engine starts, hydraulic pressure is generated by the turbo-pump of the engine. Pressure from either source is made available to the engine valves, such as the main fuel and liquid-oxygen valves and the igniter fuel valve. These valves are sequenced and controlled by the terminal countdown sequencer, stage switch selector and by mechanical and fluid pressure means."
What types of hydraulic fluids are utilized in the fluid power system for the flight control servo-actuators?," Fluid under pressure also flows through a filter, shown in the preceding figure, and to the two flight control servo-actuators on each outboard engine. The fluid power system illustrated above uses both RJ-1 ramjet fuel and RP-1 rocket propellant as hydraulic fluid. The RJ-1 is used by the Hydraulic Supply and Checkout Unit (GSE pressure source)."
What is the role of the check valves in the fuel pressurisation system for the S-IC stage?, RP-1 is the fuel used in the S-IC stage. It is pressurised by the engine turbo- pump. The two pressure sources are separated by check valves while return flow is directed to GSE or stage by the ground checkout valve. Drilled passages in the hydraulic components (valves and servo-actuators) permit a flow of fluid to thermally condition the units and to bleed gases from the fluid power system [ 7].
What is typically required in certain rocket engines between the gas generator and turbines that is not needed in turbo-pump-fed engines?," 668 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures In most rocket engines feed by turbo-pumps, the gas generator is connected directly to the turbine inlet, and consequently no special ducts are necessary. In other rocket engines, high-pressure hot-gas ducts are required to connect the gas generator to the turbines."
What type of cycle is utilized in engines like the J-2S that requires high-pressure hot-gas ducts?," Such is the case with engines having two individual turbo- pumps. Still in other rocket engines, high-pressure hot-gas ducts are required to connect the tap-off ports of the thrust chamber with the turbine. Such is the case with engines (the J-2S, for one) based on the thrust chamber tap-off cycle, which has been described in Chap."
What materials are used for high-pressure hot gas ducts to withstand temperatures near 1200 K?," 2, Sect. 2.7.H i g h - p r e s s u r eh o t - g a sd u c t sh a v er i g i dp o r t i o n sa n d also flexible portions, which are made of stainless steels and nickel-based alloys apt to resist temperatures up to about 1200 K. These ducts must be capable of absorbing de flections due to thermal expansion and also de flections due to misalignments and dynamic loads [ 3]."
What are the two potential destinations for hot gases exhausted by turbines in liquid-propellant rocket engines?," Liquid-propellant rocket engines have ducts for the hot gases exhausted by the turbines. These gases may be ducted either to a region near the exit plane of the nozzle or to a manifold of the thrust chamber. By the way, a manifold is a duct having one or more branches off the main flow stream. Common types are T-shaped and Y-shaped manifolds."
What is the primary purpose of a manifold in a liquid-propellant rocket engine?," The main function of a manifold is to distribute flow from one or more inlet passages to one or more outlet passages. A typical manifold for turbine exhaust gas used in a liquid-propellant rocket engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. The manifold illustrated in the preceding figure is designed for equal distribution of flow."
How does the design of the manifold affect the distribution of flow among its branches?," In other words, the flow areas inside the manifold are designed so as to split equally the flow among the branches. The gas exhausted by the turbine is dumped into the mainstream exhaust of the thrust chamber through an annular manifold. The cross-sectional area of the manifold decreases as it wraps around the thrust chamber, 7."
How are the turbines of the oxidiser and fuel turbo-pumps arranged in the J-2 engine?,"2 Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket Engine 669 in order for the gas to maintain a constant velocity as it is bled off through openings in the wall of the thrust chamber [ 1]. In the particular case of the J-2 engine, the turbines of the oxidiser (liquid oxygen) and fuel (liquid hydrogen) turbo-pumps are connected in series by exhaust ducting which directs the discharged exhaust gas from the fuel turbo-pump turbine to the inlet of the oxidiser turbo-pump turbine manifold."
What components prevent the mixing of oxidiser fluid and turbine gas in the turbo-pump system?," One static and two dynamic seals in series prevent the turbo-pump oxidiser fluid and the turbine gas from mixing. Both turbo-pumps are powered in series by a single gas generator, which uses the same propellants as the thrust chamber. During burn periods, the liquid-oxygen tank is pres- surised by liquid oxygen flowing through the heat exchanger in the oxidiser turbine exhaust duct."
What effect does the heat exchanger have on liquid oxygen?," The heat exchanger heats the liquid oxygen, causing it to expand. The liquid-hydrogen tank is pressurised during burn periods by gaseous hydrogen from the thrust chamber fuel manifold [ 7]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 8]i sa ne x p l o d e dv i e wo ft h e principal interconnecting components of the J-2 engine."
What is the primary role of the thrust structure assembly in a rocket vehicle?," Each stage of a rocket vehicle has a thrust structure assembly, whose principal function is to redistribute the loads applied locally by the engines into a uniform loading about the periphery of a tank (usually, the fuel tank). It also provides support for the engines, engine accessories, base heat shield, engine fairings and fins, propellant lines, retrorockets, and environmental control ducts."
What type of engines propel the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle?," 670 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures The following figure, adapted from [ 7], shows the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This stage is propelled by five F-1 engines. The lower thrust ring shown in the following figure has four hold-down points, which support the fully loaded Saturn/Apollo (approximately 2 ."
What type of aluminium alloy is used for the skin segments in the vehicle design?,"722×106kg) and also, as necessary, restrain the vehicle from lifting off at the full thrust of the F-1 engines. The skin segments are made of 7075-T6 aluminium alloy. 7.2 Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket Engine 671 In most liquid-propellant rocket engines fed by turbo-pumps, the complete engine assembly is gimballed by using a gimbal mechanism having a spherical joint, as has been shown in Chap."
What is the purpose of the turbo-pump structure in relation to the thrust chamber of the rocket vehicle?," 5, Sect. 5.6.T h i sj o i n tc o n n e c t st h et h r u s tc h a m b e rt ot h et h r u s t structure (described above) of the rocket vehicle. At u r b o - p u m ps t r u c t u r ei su s e dt of a s t e nt h et u r b o - p u m p st oe i t h e rt h et h r u s t chamber or other structural elements, such as the thrust structure."
What loads do the mounts of the turbo-pump assembly support besides the weight of the assembly itself?," The turbo-pump mounts are the connexions between the turbo-pump assembly and the engine. These mounts support the loads due to the weight of the turbo-pump assembly and also react to the loads due to engine inertia, propellant inertia, engine gimballing, differences of pressure in fluids, forces on the flanges, and gyroscopic forces."
What is the function of turbo-pump mounts in relation to thermal changes in turbo-pump and thrust chamber assemblies?," In addition, the turbo-pump mounts adapt to the differential thermal expansion or contraction of the turbo-pump assembly and of the thrust chamber assembly [ 9]. The most common types of turbo-pump mounts use struts having at least one ball- joint end connexion to accommodate dimensional tolerances and differential thermal expansion or contraction."
What configuration allows for pure compression or tension in ball-ended struts for the lightest structure?," Ball-ended struts can be arranged triangularly, to yield the lightest structure by loading its members in pure compression or tension. Another arrangement consists of close-coupled, rigid pads at one end of the turbo-pump, and one or two ball-ended struts at the other end to accommodate the dimensional variations [ 9]."
What are the common materials utilized for lines and bellows in rocket engines?," 7.3 Materials Used for Tubing in Rocket Engines The 18–8 (18% chromium and 8% nickel) corrosion-resistant steels are the most frequently used materials for lines and bellows in rocket engines. Nickel-base alloys, such as those of the Inconel®and Hastelloy®families, are also used for ducts and bellows, because of their higher strengths, greater fatigue lives, and better corrosion resistances."
What type of structure do metals used for bellows-joint restraining brackets possess that contributes to their toughness at reduced temperatures?," Aluminium alloys are used in some non-critical or low-stress appli- cations. Due to forming requirements, only high-ductility alloys in the annealing condition are used for corrugated sections [ 1]. Bellows-joint restraining brackets for cryogenic propellants are made of metals having face-centred cubic structure, which have high toughness at low temperatures."
What materials are used for flexible hoses that include a wire braid?," Restraining brackets for storable propellants are made of high-strength steels having body-centred cubic or face-centred cubic structure. Flexible hoses, including wire braid, are made of 321 CRES, which is a stabilised austenitic stainless steel with addition of titanium. Other alloys, such as Hastelloy®Ca n dI n c o n e l®718, are used for applications in special environments."
What criteria are considered for selecting materials for fluid-carrying ducts in rocket engines?," Materials used for tubing in rocket engines are chosen according to criteria of chemical compatibility with fluids, physical and mechanical properties, formability, weldability, and costs. These criteria have been considered at length in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.7for propellant tanks. A brief account is given here for what concerns speci fically fluid-carrying ducts and their flexible components."
What factors influence the loss of ductility in metallic alloys when exposed to gaseous hydrogen at high pressure?," 672 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures As to chemical compatibility of fluids with tubing materials, gaseous hydrogen at high pressure causes a loss of ductility in many metallic alloys. This effects depends on the temperature, pressure, and purity of the gas, and also on the exposure time and level of stress."
Which types of alloys show increased susceptibility to brittleness when exposed to pure hydrogen at room temperature?," Ferritic, martensitic, and bainitic steels, nickel-base alloys, and titanium alloys become brittle when exposed to pure hydrogen at room temperature, this effect being higher at increasing pressure. High-strength alloys are often more susceptible than low-strength alloys to loss of ductility. Austenitic stainless steels such as 310 and 316, some aluminium alloys such as 6061-T6, 2219-T6, and 7075-T73, pure copper and beryllium copper, and the precipitation-hardened stainless steel A-286 are slightly affected."
"What factors contribute to the deterioration of mechanical properties in Inconel®718, Inconel®X-750, Waspaloy®, and René®41 when exposed to high-pressure hydrogen?"," Inconel®718, Inconel®X-750, Waspaloy®,a n dR e n é®41 are highly susceptible to loss of ductility when exposed to gaseous hydrogen at high pressure [ 1]. The loss of ductility due to hydrogen is associated with a loss of fracture toughness. The presence of hydrogen, water vapour, and other gases increases the effects of crack initiation and crack growth rate."
What substances can lead to stress-corrosion cracking in stainless steel 321 CRES?," In addition to hydrogen, substances which can have undesirable effects on metallic tubing are: •propellants susceptible to catalytic decomposition, such as anhydrous hydrazine, mono-methyl-hydrazine, and Aerozine 50, which generate hot gas in the presence of molybdenum, iron, copper, or silver; •nitric acid resulting from absorption of water in nitrogen tetroxide, which attacks aluminium alloys; •chlorides from cleaning fluids, which can induce stress-corrosion cracking in stainless steel 321 CRES; and •uninhibited (brown) nitrogen tetroxide, which can induce corrosion cracking in titanium alloys."
What are the primary properties evaluated for metals utilized in tubing applications?," It is also necessary to take account of the environment to which metals used for tubing are exposed. For example, titanium exposed to oxygen can ignite and oxidise explosively as a result of an impact. The principal physical and mechanical properties of metals used for tubing are strength, elongation, and density."
What characteristics are essential for materials intended for the construction of corrugated bellows walls?, Minimum bend radius and fatigue resistance are desirable properties in materials to be used for corrugated walls of bellows. Cryogenic temperatures reduce the tough- ness of most materials having body-centred cubic structure. Data of some metals and non-metals exposed to low temperatures (from 20.37 to 533.
What are the materials mentioned for use in flexible lines?,"15 K) are given in [ 10]. Some materials used for flexible lines are aluminium alloy 6061-T6, stainless steel 321 CRES, Hastelloy®C, Inconel®625, titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V annealed, and Inconel®718 age-hardened. The principal physical and mechanical properties of these materials are given in Table 3, page 45, of [ 1]."
What key characteristics must materials for flexible duct parts demonstrate compared to those for other components?," The materials to be used for flexible parts of interconnecting ducts must be chosen with more demanding requirements than the materials for the remaining parts. Among these requirements, the most important are those of formability, and resistance to corrosion and fatigue. In particular, the materials chosen for bellows corrugations or 7."
What properties must materials have to be suitable for tubing in rocket engines?,3 Materials Used for Tubing in Rocket Engines 673 inner cores of flexible hoses must be ductile. Corrosion resistance is also required for these materials in order to avoid holes and cracks which can give rise to leakage. Fatigue resistance is required in order for a bellows to bear the desired number of flexural cycles.
Which material is noted for being unaffected by ductility loss due to hydrogen?," Materials which have shown good properties of strength-to-weight ratio, weldability, and elongation are Inconel®718, Nitronic®40 (a high-manganese stainless steel with high strength and excellent resistance to corrosion at high temper- atures), and 321 and 347 CRES. In particular, the Nitronic®40 alloy is scarcely affected by loss of ductility due to hydrogen."
What are the corrosion-resistant metals typically used for aerospace bolts and nuts?," Bolts and nuts for aerospace applications are usually made of corrosion-resistant metals, such as Inconel®718, Inconel®X-750, Monel®K-500, and René®41. The materials indicated above for fluid-carrying ducts have generally good prop- erties of ductility, and therefore deform plastically under stress around the tips of cracks."
What factors should be considered in selecting materials to avoid loss of ductility and failure?," However, particular conditions of either load or temperature can cause a loss of ductility, in which case a material may fail. Therefore, the choice of a possible material should take account of its fracture toughness and resistance to subcritical flaw growth, as has been shown in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.8."
What types of materials have shown superior performance in forming elements for fluid-carrying ducts?," The formability of a given material depends on its ductility, that is, on its aptitude to form rolls, bends, fittings, and corrugations for bellows. Under this aspect, corrosion- resistant steels and nickel-base alloys have proven to be the best materials for all formed elements of fluid-carrying ducts."
What are the two methods mentioned for welding elements of lines?," The weldability of a material is important, because welding is the most used method of joining permanently various elements of a line. In case of flexible hoses, brazing is the most common method of connecting permanently the braid of a hose to each of the connecting points. Methods of welding elements of lines include tungsten-inert-gas (TIG) and electron beam, as has been shown in Chap."
What type of coating is recommended for corrosion-resistant steels used on bellows and similar components?," 6, Sect. 6.7. Lubricants are sometimes used on the surfaces of bellows or other elements of lines. For this purpose, a corrosion-inhibiting type of molybdenum disul fide (MoS 2) coating can be used for corrosion-resistant steels. Nickel-base alloys resist better than steels to chemical attack. Plating or lubricants are also used on bolts and nuts to prevent thread galling."
What is the type of lubricant utilized in the Saturn engine systems?," A thread lubricant used for the Saturn engine systems was a phosphoric-acid-bonded dry- film lubricant. Platings are used at temperatures higher than 422 K [ 1]. 7.4 Coupling Components for Tubing The components described here are devices which contain and control the flow of fluids in ducts. These devices can be classi fied into the following categories: disconnects, couplings, fittings, fixed joints, and seals."
What components are typically found in a manually-operated disconnect for parabole connectors?," A brief description is given below for each category. Ad i s c o n n e c ti sat y p eo fs e p a r a b l ec o n n e c t o rc o n s i s t i n go ft w os e p a r a b l eh a l v e s , an interface seal, and usually a latch-release locking mechanism. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11], shows three stages of operation of a typical manually-operated disconnect."
What type of connections require more than a few seconds for engagement or disengagement?," 674 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Disconnects are used as interfaces between rocket vehicles and ground systems, or between stages of a rocket vehicle. Ac o u p l i n gi sam e c h a n i c a l l y - a c t u a t e d ,s e p a r a b l ec o n n e c t o rw h i c hr e q u i r e sm o r e than a few seconds for engagement or disengagement."
What type of mechanical joint is formed by a threaded connector?," Examples of couplings are threaded connectors, bolted flanges, and dynamic swivel couplings. A threaded connector is a line fitting which provides a separable mechanical joint secured by a single threaded nut, whereas a bolted flange connector uses several bolts, a clamp, or a combination of these to secure the joint [ 2]."
What factors influence the selection of threaded versus flanged connectors?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11], shows four types of threaded connectors. 7.4 Coupling Components for Tubing 675 The choice between threaded and flanged connectors is determined by the size of the line and by the amount of preloading required to establish a satisfactory seal over the entire range of loads [ 2]."
What type of connectors should be used when loads necessitate a restraining force from bolts or clamps?," Flanged connectors are used where loads require the type of restraining force provided by bolts or clamps, or where coupling reliability dictates the use of more than one threaded clamping fastener [ 11]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11], shows eight types of flanged connectors."
What design feature of a swiveling rotary tubular shaft helps reduce friction forces resulting from axial pressure thrust?," 676 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Ad y n a m i cs w i v e lc o u p l i n gi saj o i n td e s i g n e ds u c ht h a tt h es w i v e l l i n go rr o t a r y tubular shaft is pressure-balanced, so as to eliminate high sealing and bearing friction forces caused by axial pressure thrust [ 2]."
"What is the purpose of fittings in a tubing, line, or ducting assembly?"," On the Saturn engines, swivel couplings were used successfully between moving members of mechanical components (for example, valve stems, actuator shafts, and pistons). However, provisions were made to dispose of leakage, which is inherent in this type of coupling [ 11]. Fittings are devices used to change flow area or direction while connecting two or more straight elements in a tubing, line, or ducting assembly."
What types of fittings does NASA's figure illustrate for connecting tubes of varying diameters?," Such devices are the L-shaped, T-shaped, Y-shaped, et c. tubes used to route fluids to required areas. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11], shows (above) a low-pressure- loss fitting for joining tubes of different sizes, and (below) two types of tap-off fittings. 7.4 Coupling Components for Tubing 677 Fixed joints are permanent (that is, non-separable) connexions of fluid-carrying ducts."
What joining techniques are preferred for fixed joints when low weight and high reliability are prioritized?," They are used when low weight and high reliability are more important than ease of separation [ 2]. The joining methods used for fixed joints are welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, soldering, and interference fit. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11], shows six types of welded joints used in tubing."
What are the three common types of welded joints mentioned?," 678 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures With reference to the preceding figure, the butt (a), fillet (b), and sleeve (c) types of welded joints are very common. These three types are sometimes used in combinations, the most common of them being fillet and sleeve (f). When possible, weld joints are located in areas free from vibrations."
Which welding method is primarily used for creating fixed joints?," In particular, locations in which vibrations are perpendicular to the tube axis are avoided. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding is the most widely used of the joining methods for fixed joints. Gas Metal Arc (GMA) Welding is also used to join heavy sections, when it is desirable to reduce the number of weld passes needed to complete a joint."
What specific situations make electron beam welding particularly suitable for use?," These methods have been described in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.7.E l e c t r o nB e a m( E B )W e l d i n g( a vacuum-based process in which a beam of high-velocity electrons is applied to the two metals to be joined) is applied in particular cases, for example, to join metals where a narrow weld bead or minimum heat input to the parts is necessary, or to join parts made of titanium alloys, which must be protected from oxygen."
What are the key differences between brazing and welding regarding the bonding process and joint creation?," According to Howell and Weathers [ 2], brazing is a metal-joining operation performed at temperatures ranging between those of welding and soft soldering, where soft soldering temperatures are considered to be below 723 K. Brazing differs from welding, because in the former: (1) bonding results from wetting rather than melting the base alloy; (2) the brazing filler metal (brazing alloy) is made to flow into the joint by capillary action to create the bond; and (3) the brazing filler metal is an alloy having a composition different from that of the metals to be joined."
What materials are commonly used as brazing filler metals in bonding processes?," Brazing filler metals used are often alloys of silver, aluminium, gold, copper, cobalt, or nickel. According to Kazakov [ 12], diffusion bonding is a process by which a joint can be made between similar and dissimilar metals, alloys, and non-metals, through 7.4 Coupling Components for Tubing 679 the action of diffusion of atoms across the interface, brought about by the bonding pressure and heat applied for a speci fic length of time."
What titanium alloys are typically used for diffusion bonding with stainless steel in tubular transition sections?," Diffusion bonding has been used for a titanium-to-stainless-steel tubular transition section. These transition joints were developed to provide a fixed joint between titanium propellant tanks and stainless steel lines. Materials commonly diffusion bonded are Ti-5Al-2.5Sn or Ti-6Al-4 V alloys with 304L, 321, and 347 stainless steel."
What temperature threshold must fillers used in soldering not exceed for successful metal joining?," All titanium alloy-to-stainless-steel combinations have been used successfully [11]. Soldering is a metal-joining operation similar to brazing, but takes place with fillers (also known as solders) which melt at a temperature below 723 K. Soldered joints have been successful in low-pressure applications."
What type of joint utilizes pressure from one part against another to achieve fastening?," They are light, require simple heating tools, can be assembled in a minimum envelope, do not need inert-gas shielding, and are readily made on in-place hardware [ 11]. An interference fit joint, also known as tight fit connector, is a fastening between two parts which uses the pressure exerted by one of the parts against the other to obtain the desired result."
What occurs along the mating surface after the enveloped part is joined with the enveloping part?," For this purpose, the inner diameter of enveloping part (also known as the hole or the hub) is smaller than the outer diameter of enveloped part (also known as the shaft). Therefore, in order to fasten the two parts, it is necessary to apply force during assembly. After the parts are joined, the enveloped part exerts a pressure against the enveloping part along the mating surface, with consequent elastic deformation of the whole assembly."
In which type of ducts are interference fit joints occasionally utilized?," Interference fit joints without the use of some other joining method are not used in ducts for propellants, but are used sometimes in ducts for pneumatic or hydraulic fluids [ 11]. The de finitions of the joining methods indicated above (welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, etc.) are rather intuitive than rigorous, for the sake of clarity."
What characteristics must flanges possess to ensure the static seals' integrity in aerospace applications?," Formal de finitions of such methods can be found, for example, in [ 13]. Connecting flanges or glands for tubing used in aerospace vehicles should be rigid enough to maintain the integrity of static seals. Flanges should have the surface finish, the radial clearances, and the rigidity required by the speci fic seal used."
What are the two types of flange deflection resulting from insufficient rigidity?," Flanges having insuf ficient rigidity or inadequately bolted are susceptible to rotation under operational loads. Two types (bowing and rotation) of flange de flection due to lack of rigidity are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11]. 680 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures As a general rule, it is desirable to keep the bolt circumference of a flanged joint as close as possible to the seal, and to use rather many bolts of small diameter than af e wb o l t so fl a r g ed i a m e t e r ."
What are the factors contributing to pressure loss in tubing?,"N A S A[ 1]r e c o m m e n d st h ef o l l o w i n gd e s i g nf o ra flanged joint. 7.5 Control of Pressure Loss in Tubing Causes of pressure loss in tubing are changes of flow direction, changes of flow area, changes of flow distribution, and friction between a flowing fluid and the walls of a duct."
How does the pressure loss coefficient for an elbow change with the ratio of bend radius to inside diameter?," As to the first cause, when the interfaces between the tanks and the pumps or between the pumps and the combustion chamber of a rocket engine do not permit rectilinear ducts, then elbow-shaped parts of tubing must be used. For a given Reynolds number, the pressure loss coef ficient for an elbow decreases, reaches a minimum value, and then increases as the ratio R/Dof the bend radius to the inside diameter of the elbow increases."
How can pressure losses be mitigated when routing lines with small bend radii elbows?," When the routing of a line requires elbows of small bend radii, the consequent pressure losses can be reduced by either choosing the optimum value of the R/Dratio for each elbow, or adding flow guide vanes to the elbows, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. 7.5 Control of Pressure Loss in Tubing 681 Flow guide lines have been used in sharp elbows at the pump inlet ducts of the engines of the Centaur, Thor, Atlas, and Saturn S-IC."
What role do flow guide vanes play in enhancing the performance of a propulsion system?," Such vanes have also been used in the pump discharge ducts of the Thor and Jupiter. The reduction of pressure losses improves the performance of a rocket engine. Since oscillations of the fluid can excite the flow guide vanes, then their natural frequencies must be calculated, in order to avoid resonance phenomena."
What is the primary purpose of flow liners in bellows concerning friction losses?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], shows flow guide vanes used in elbows at the inlet ducts of centrifugal turbo-pumps. In bellows, flow liners are frequently used to reduce the high losses due to friction at the corrugations. 682 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Ac h a n g ei n fl o wa r e ao c c u r sf r e q u e n t l ya tt h et w oe n d so fad u c t ."
What angle should not exceed π/18 rad in expanding conical ducts to minimize pressure losses?,"T h es h a p eo f the transition portion near each end is to be determined in such a way as to prevent excessive pressure losses, which would take place in case of an abrupt change in flow area. For the same purpose, the edges of a duct at each end should be rounded instead of sharp. In case of expanding conical ducts, the included angle of the cone frustum should be less than or equal to π/18 rad (10°)."
How does the inner diameter of a fitting affect pressure losses in small diameter ducts?," For ducts of small diameter having threaded fittings, it is necessary to determine the pressure losses by taking account that the inner diameter of the fitting is usually smaller than the inner diameter of the duct. The flow distribution at the exit of a duct (for example, at the exit of a feed duct for a rocket engine) is to be determined carefully because of its implications on the performance of the components."
What methods can enhance flow distribution when rocket engine discharge ports are oppositely placed?," For example, when the pumps of a rocket engine have discharge ports placed oppositely, care must be taken in order to have equal pressure losses at the two ports. A flow distribution can be improved by using either flow guide vanes at the elbows, as shown in the preceding figure, or flow straighteners of the egg-crate type placed downstream of the elbows, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]."
What component was utilized in the Apollo Lunar Module's propellant feed lines to balance pressure loss in ducts?," Another method of achieving a balanced distribution of pressure loss at the terminal ends of two ducts is based on a flow splitter. This method was used in the propellant feed lines of the descent engine of the Apollo Lunar Module. 7.5 Control of Pressure Loss in Tubing 683 Friction between the walls of a duct and the fluid flowing into it can cause large losses of pressure, in cause of ducts having rough walls."
What types of vibrations are specifically mentioned in relation to pump inlet control?," To reduce friction, it neces- sary to use ducts with smooth walls and to avoid protrusions into the flow stream, such as those which are sometimes caused by welds. 7.6 Control of Vibrations at the Inlet of Pumps The fundamental concepts on the longitudinal vibrations, called pogo vibrations, of ar o c k e tv e h i c l eh a v eb e e nd i s c u s s e di nC h a p ."
What causes pogo vibrations in a rocket stage according to the description provided?,"2 ,S e c t . 2.9.T h ep r e s e n tp a r a g r a p h is meant to show in further detail how such vibrations can be suppressed by using devices installed in the feed lines of rocket engines. The pogo vibrations are due to a feedback interaction between the propulsion system and the structure of a rocket stage."
What causes the vibrations in the structure of a propellant feed system?," These vibrations are generated by pulsa- tions in the thrust force, which cause a response in the structure. The structural response applies accelerations to the suction part of a propellant feed system. The two feed lines (for respectively the fuel and the oxidiser) respond separately to these accelerations, and cause pressure pulses at the inlet of the two pumps."
What effect do pressure pulses have on the rate of propellant flow to the combustion chamber?," As a result of these pressure pulses, the pumps and the discharge lines transmit a varying rate of propellant flow to the combustion chamber. The combustion chamber, in turn, generates a pulsating pressure and a pulsating thrust. Instability occurs when the pulsating thrust is fed back to the structure, so as to reinforce the initial perturbation."
What role did the gas bubble in the standpipe serve for the oxidiser in the Titan II system?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], illustrates the vibration suppressing method used for the two pumps of the Titan II. 684 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures In the Titan II, a bubble of gas was enclosed in a standpipe connected to the oxidiser feed-line. This bubble provided a cushion or a soft spring, which acted on the mass of the oxidiser in the standpipe."
How was energy from pressure oscillations in the oxidiser feed-line transferred to the spring-and-mass system?," In this manner, the energy due to the pressure oscillations in the oxidiser feed-line was transferred to this spring- and-mass system, by choosing judiciously the volume or the height of the bubble enclosed in the standpipe. The fuel feed-lines had accumulators of the piston type, which used a mechanical arrangement comprising an helical spring and a piston to provide the desired soft-spring action."
What elements contributed to the equivalent mass necessary for the described mechanical system?," The fixed mass of this mechanical arrangement and the mass of fuel in the accumulator provided the equivalent mass required for ar e s o n a n tm e c h a n i c a ls y s t e m .T h eo s c i l l a t i o ns u p p r e s s i o nd e v i c e sd e s c r i b e da b o v e were designed and tuned so that their frequency responses, coupled with the feed-line 7."
What system successfully minimized pressure oscillations in the suction ducts of pumps during the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle?,"6 Control of Vibrations at the Inlet of Pumps 685 properties, would provide the maximum possible attenuation of pressure oscillations in the suction ducts of the pumps, as a result of the tank-structure oscillations. The pogo suppression system used for the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle is shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 7]."
What is the function of the liquid oxygen pre-valve cavities in the described system?," This system shown above uses the liquid oxygen pre-valve cavities as surge cham- bers to suppress the pogo vibrations. The liquid oxygen pre-valve cavities are pres- surised with gaseous helium 11 min before scheduled lift-off time from ground supply by opening the pogo suppression valves. During the initial fill period (from 11 to 9 min before scheduled lift-off time), the filling of the valves is closely moni- tored by using measurements supplied by the liquid level resistance thermometers R3(primary) and R 2(backup)."
How is cavity pressure maintained after umbilical disconnect?," The gaseous helium ground fill continues to maintain the cavity pressure until umbilical disconnect. After umbilical disconnect, the cavity pressure is maintained by the cold helium spheres located in the liquid oxygen tank. The status on the system operation is monitored through two pressure transducers and four liquid level resistance thermometers."
What is the maximum absolute pressure that the first pressure sensor can measure?, One pressure transducer (0–5.516 MPa absolute pressure) monitors the system input pressure. A second pressure transducer (0–1.034 MPa absolute pressure) monitors the pressure inside the No. 1 engine liquid oxygen pre-valve cavity. The pressure readings are transmitted via telemetry to ground monitors.
How many liquid level resistance thermometers are used to monitor the liquid level within each pre-valve?, The liquid level within the pre-valves is monitored by four liquid level resistance thermometers in each pre-valve. These thermometers transmit 686 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures a“ w e t ”( c o l d e rt h a n1 0 8K )a n da“ d r y ”( w a r m e rt h a n1 0 8K )r e a d i n gt og r o u n d monitors [ 7].
What is the purpose of the system illustrated in the NASA figure concerning the Space Shuttle's liquid oxygen feed-lines?," The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], is a scheme of the pogo suppression system used in the liquid oxygen feed-lines on the main engines of the Space Shuttle. The pogo suppression system shown in the preceding figure is incorporated in the feed system of liquid oxygen at the inlet of the high-pressure oxygen turbo-pump."
What medium is utilized for flow suppression after the initial helium precharge in the accumulator system?," This system uses an accumulator filled with gas to suppress flow oscillations induced by the vehicle. Gaseous oxygen is tapped off the heat exchanger in the oxidiser-tank pressurisation system. This gas is used as the compliant medium after an initial helium precharge. The system controls the level of liquid oxygen in the accumulator by means of an over flow line, which routes over flowing fluids to the inlet of the low-pressure oxygen turbo-pump."
What is the frequency range of flow oscillations that the accumulator prevents from transmitting to the turbo-pump?," The accumulator, which is shown in detail in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9,s e r v e sa sa n attenuator in the flow of liquid oxygen in the circuit, and prevents the transmission of the flow oscillations (at frequencies ranging from 20 to 30 Hz) into the high-pressure oxygen turbo-pump. This system is designed to provide suf ficient over flow at the maximum decreasing pressure transient in the discharge duct of the low-pressure oxygen turbo-pump."
What is the purpose of a bellows joint as defined by Howell and Weathers?," The engine controller (shown in detail in Chap. 5, Sect. 5.2) provides signals for valve actuation, and monitors the system operation [ 1]. 7.7 Bellows Joints 687 7.7 Bellows Joints According to the de finition given by Howell and Weathers [ 2], a bellows joint is an elastic, corrugated, tubular connector used for conducting a fluid between points of relative angular, transverse, lateral, or combined motion."
What components make up a bellows joint in a pipeline system?," Bellows joints are used where axial, lateral, angular, or combined de flections exist between interconnected components of lines. A bellows joint in a line consists of the following parts: •ab e l l o w s ,w h i c hi st h e fl e x i b l ec o r r u g a t e dt u b ec a r r y i n gt h ep r e s s u r ee x e r t e db y the fluid conducted in the line; •restraints on the bellows, which prevent movements caused by internal pressure; •means of attaching the bellows to the line; and •a fl o wl i n e rf o rt h eb e l l o w s ."
What are the four types of motions that a free bellows can absorb at its ends?, Ab e l l o w sj o i n ti nad u c tc a na b s o r bd e fl e c t i o n sw i t hm u c hs m a l l e rr e a c t i o nl o a d s than the loads in a hard line. A free bellows can absorb four types of motion applied to its ends: (a) axial motion due to tension or compression forces; (b) offset motion with end planes parallel; (c) angular motion about its centre; and (d) torsional motion about its axis.
What type of motion can a gimbal ring linkage specifically absorb in a bellows system?," Various restrains or linkages can be used in order for a bellows to absorb only certain types of motion. For example, a gimbal ring linkage allows a bellows to absorb only angular motion. An internal (left) and an external (right) mounting of gimbal rings for a bellows joint are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]."
What is the frequency range of vibrations associated with bellows joints in this context?," Other drawings showing bellows joints mounted on gimbals or hinges can be found in [ 14]. Ab e l l o w sj o i n tm u s ta l s oa b s o r bv i b r a t i o n s ,w h i c ha r ed u et om o t i o n so fe i t h e r the fluid conducted in the line or mechanical parts of the engine. The frequencies of 688 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures these vibrations are of the order of magnitude of several thousand hertz."
What happens to a bellows when vibrations cause stresses to surpass the material's fatigue limits?," When the stresses resulting from such vibrations exceed the fatigue limits of the material of which a bellows is made, then failure occurs. Bellows are used for ducts of rocket engines in various sizes and operating condi- tions. A bellows operates usually in the plastic range of the material of which it is made."
What are the four types of pressures that a bellows must manage during operation?," This is because the necessity of reducing weight implies small values of thickness for the bellows walls, provided that the magnitudes of the reactions at the bellows ends are acceptable. A formed bellows with straight corrugated sidewall is the type most frequently used for rocket engines. The types of pressures to be carried by a bellows in operating conditions are: •normal operating pressure; •surge pressure; •proof pressure; and •burst pressure."
What causes the fluctuation in pressure within a fluid conducting line?," By surge pressure we mean the variation of pressure which occurs in a line conducting fluid as a result of a change in the flow velocity. This variation of pressure may occur in a line, for example, when a pump starts or stops, or a valve is opened or closed rapidly, or the diameter of the line changes abruptly."
What occurs upstream of a valve when it is closed rapidly regarding the velocity and pressure head of the fluid?," When a valve is closed rapidly, the velocity head of the fluid moving forward in a line decreases whereas its pressure head increases suddenly, due to the compression which occurs upstream of the valve. By proof pressure we mean: proof pressure =(normal operating pressure +surge pressure )×safety factor As has been shown in Chap."
What is the relationship between burst pressure and proof pressure as described?," 6, Sect. 6.9,t h es a f e t yf a c t o ri sam u l t i p l i e r ,w h o s e value (greater than unity) is chosen by the designer to take account of small variations of the properties of the material, of the quality of manufacturing, and of the magnitude and distribution of the load. Finally, by burst pressure we mean: burst pressure =proof pressure ×safety factor These pressures generate hoop (circumferential) stresses and bulging (meridian) stresses, which must be carried by the corrugated sidewall."
What is allowed for a bellows under burst pressure in terms of deformation and leakage?," A bellows must resist column buckling under application of proof pressure. Under application of burst pressure, a bellows is permitted to deform and take permanent set, but not to leak. The limiting bulging stresses and allowable motion stresses (bending stresses) of materials frequently used for bellows are given in the following table, adapted from [1]."

What factors contribute to the low fatigue lives of bellows?," These causes are brie fly considered below. As to fatigue, bellows are subject to large de flections at their ends, due to the offset motion cited above. Bellows have usually thin walls, in order to reduce weight. Consequently, the materials of which bellows are made operate under stresses near or in the plastic range, with resulting low fatigue lives."
What factors should be considered to prevent fatigue life reduction in bellows subjected to vibrations?," Bellows are also subject to vibrations, caused by the fluids or by mechanical parts. They must be designed so that no reduction in fatigue life is caused by vibration. In order to predict vibratory stresses, it is possible to use known vibration inputs relating to other engines in the same conditions, and compare such inputs with the frequencies of resonance of the given ducts, which can be calculated."
What is the most common failure mode for a bellows that leads to leakage?," Otherwise, it is possible to construct a prototype and test it on various engines, while the vibration environment is measured. When a bellows operates at excitation frequencies matching any of its natural frequencies of vibration, then its fatigue life can be exceeded in a short interval of time. The most frequent failure mode for a bellows is a fatigue crack, which gives rise to leakage through the corrugated wall."
What are the three primary modes of vibration observed in a bellows?," The cracks develop circumferentially in areas of maximum bending stress, which are the crowns and the roots of the corrugations. 690 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures The primary modes of vibration for a bellows are: (a) the axial or accordion mode; (b) the lateral mode; and (c) the individual convolution mode, in which the individual corrugations rotate back and forth at the inner diameter, and pivot about the outer diameter."
"What phenomenon is common in braided hose vibrations due to flow oscillations, involving fixed pivot points for corrugations?"," In particular, the individual convolution mode occurs often in vibrations of braided hoses caused by flow oscillations, where the outer diameter of the corrugations is restrained by the braid friction, and consequently the outer point of each corrugation is a fixed pivot point for the corrugation excited by flow forces."
What factors affect the phase of individual convolution modes in flexible flow lines?," The individual convo- lution mode may be in phase or out of phase, depending on how each corrugation moves with respect to the others. The primary modes of vibration (a), (b) and (c) described above are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. Bellows incorporated in flexible flow lines are frequently subject to vibrations induced by fluids moving at high velocity, with consequent failure due to fatigue stresses."
What are two types of components that can experience vibrations in engines?," This type of failure is avoided by using internal flow liners, which prevent the flow stream from impinging on the corrugations. However, care must be taken, because internal flow liners, too, may be subject to flow-induced vibrations. Bellows are also subject to vibrations induced by mechanical parts of engines."
What should be avoided in the design of bellows to prevent resonance with exciting vibrations?," When the frequencies of the exciting vibrations are known, for example, through measurements, then bellows can be designed so that their natural frequencies should not match the excitation frequencies. 7.7 Bellows Joints 691 Bellows may be subject to buckling due to excessive internal or external pressure."
What are the two types of buckling mentioned and what conditions lead to their occurrence?," Buckling due to high internal pressure results in column instability, whereas buckling due to high external pressure results in crushed corrugations. Buckling can occur only when the pressures in actual operating conditions are beyond the pressures predicted in the original requirements. Ab e l l o w sm a yb es u b j e c tt oc o r r o s i o n ,d e p e n d i n go nt h em a t e r i a lo fw h i c hi ti s made."
What are the principal challenges faced during the manufacturing process of bellows?," A material commonly used for bellows is stainless steel 321 CRES, which is resistant but still susceptible to corrosion, because of its high percentage of iron. This and other materials have been discussed in paragraph 3. The principal dif ficulties in the manufacturing of bellows are material thinning, heat-treatment control, welding, and convolution stack-off."
What percentage below the nominal thickness are bellows thinned at the corrugation crowns?," Bellows are thinned at the corrugation crowns, about 5% or 10% below the nominal thickness of the wall. As a result of this thinning, higher de flection takes place in the thinned section, because its stiffness is reduced, and consequently higher stresses and lower resistance to fatigue can occur. Heat treatment of bellows is controlled in order to avoid degraded performance caused by improper treatment."
What is the consequence of oxidation during heat treatment on material strength?," In particular, this control requires the maintenance of the proper gaseous environment during heat treatment, to avoid oxidation and consequent strength reduction. Welding problems are due to insuf ficient quality control. Such problems can be avoided by inspecting radiographically all welds. Convolution stack-off is the eccentricity of convolutions or corrugations of the bellows with respect to each other."
How does convolution stack-off affect the alignment of components for welding in assembly processes?," Since this eccentricity depends on the tools used in the process of fabrication, then all of the eccentricity is accumulated in the same direction, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. 692 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Convolution stack-off makes it dif ficult to align the bellows for welding into its next assembly."
"What type of devices are necessary for handling bellows during processing, shipping, and installation?"," This accumulation can be controlled by rotating the bellows after the forming of each convolution. It is necessary to use handling-protection devices in the duct assembly and during processing, shipping, and installation of bellows. This is particularly important in case of bellows having thin walls (less than or equal to 0."
What is the purpose of strong-back fixtures in relation to bellows joints in a duct?,"762 mm). In order to protect the bellows joints incorporated in a duct from over-de flection, it is necessary to use strong-back fixtures which attach to the duct on either side of each bellows joint and form a protective bridge around it. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1], shows (right) a strong-back fixture and (left) a shell-type cover for protection of bellows."
"What are the characteristics of the gimbal-ring joint regarding pressure, temperature, torsional loads, and angular deflections?"," As has been shown above, the most common type of restraint used for bellows joints is the one mounted on gimbal rings. Other types of restraint are the hinged joint, the ball joint, and the braided wire sheath. The gimbal-ring joint can be designed to withstand high pressures and temper- atures. It can also withstand torsional loads and absorb angular de flections in all planes."
What prevents excessive angular motion in bellows?," Excessive angular motion of the bellows can be prevented by means of stops, and the pivot pins which carry the loads can be designed for either single-shear or double-shear support. The same considerations apply to the hinged joint, which allows angular motion in only one plane. Another type of external, tension-tie restraint is a braided wire sheath, as is the case with a flexible hose."
What type of joint can absorb angular and shear deflections while also functioning as a vibration damper?," A joint of this type can absorb both angular and shear de flections. It also acts as a vibration damper for the bellows. Friction between the braid and the bellows can be reduced by using an adapter, which provides clearance at the end of the corrugations, and by applying a solid dry- film lubricant on the outer surface of the bellows and on the inner surface of the braid."
What type of joint can be used instead of a bellows joint when a duct experiences small or medium pressure?," 7.7 Bellows Joints 693 The lubricants used for this purpose must be compatible with liquid oxygen, when this is the fluid conducted through the given line. Al i n kj o i n tw i t hi n t e r n a lt i er e s t r a i n tc a nb eu s e di n s t e a do fag i m b a lj o i n tw h e n a duct is subject to small or medium pressures."
What causes high friction losses in low-pressure ducts of gas turbines?," It is used frequently in low-pressure ducts of gas turbines. It has de disadvantage of high friction losses, due to the restric- tion to flow in the frontal section. In particular, a chain-link joint is a link joint in which the pivot point of the linkage is not fixed, but depends on the plane in which the joint lies."
What type of joint was utilized in the inlet line to the liquid-oxygen pump of the F-1 engine?, A chain-link joint with internal tie restraint is shown in the following figure die to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. Ab a l l - b e a r i n gb a l l - j o i n tr e s t r a i n ti ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r ed u et ot h e courtesy of NASA [ 1]. This type of joint was used for test in the inlet line to the liquid-oxygen pump of the F-1 engine.
What type of motion does the bellows joint provide while applying a uniform load to the pump flange?," 694 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures The bellows joint using the restraint illustrated in the preceding figure was located immediately upstream of the pump inlet flange, due to the large pressure separating load. This joint could provide a restraint and a motion of the gimbal type while applying a uniform circumferential load to the pump flange."
What purpose do the flexible joints in the RS-25 engine serve regarding vehicle movement?," The flexible joints used for the RS-25 engine (burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen) are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 4]. The flexible joints in the lines of the RS-25 engine allow movement for vehicle steering, while maintaining the internal pressure and temperature in the lines."
What type of joints are used to connect the gimballed engine to the vehicle or non-gimballed components?," These joints must be flexible, because the lines connect either the gimballed engine with the vehicle or the gimballed engine with non-gimballing components. 7.7 Bellows Joints 695 A fl e x i b l em e t a l l i cb e l l o w si su s e da st h ep r e s s u r ev e s s e l .T h i sb e l l o w sh a se a c h of its ends welded into a section of fluid ducting, in order to provide a continuous, leak-proof pathway."
What structure provides flexibility and pressure integrity in bellows?," The bellows have several thin plies in a sandwich con figuration, instead of a single thick sheet of metal. This arrangement makes the bellows more flexible and maintains integrity against pressure. The ducts which contain flexible joints internally tied have an internal diameter large enough to allow an internal support mounted on gimbals."
"What type of joint is used for the internal support arrangement described, which maintains the connection of the flexible joint ends?"," This internal support arrangement saves weight in comparison with an external support. Were it not for the gimbal joint, which holds both ends of the flexible joint together, the internal operating pressure of the duct would expand the flexible bellows longitudinally like an accordion. The joint of the internal gimballed support is of the ball-and-socket type."
What is the purpose of the integral flow liner in the flexible joints?," Ducts with small internal diameters use an internal gimbal ring to restrain the bellows. The ends of the flexible joint are attached to the gimbal ring (which is centred over the bellows) at two points, so as to form a universal-type joint. The flexible joints contain an integral flow liner. This liner prevents the propellant flowing through the duct from impinging on the corrugations of the bellows, which could cause turbulence in the flow and vibrations in the materials."
What shape are the overlapping sections of the liner designed to facilitate joint movement?," The liner is made up of two or three overlapping pieces. The outside ends of the end pieces are welded into the flexible joint, so as to form a continuous, smooth internal diameter when the flexible joint is welded into a duct. The overlapping portions of the liner are shaped as a truncated ball and socket, to allow movement of the flexible joint."
What component provides a route for propellant to exit after the engine shuts down?, The liner allows propellant to fill the space between it and the bellows. Screened ports at the upstream ends of the flow liner provide a path for propellant to exit the space behind the liner after engine shutdown [ 4]. The flexible joints used in the RS-25 engine are the internal tripod and the external-gimbal ring joints.
What serves as the primary application for the internal tripod joint?," The internal tripod joint is used for the low-pressure discharge ducts, where the pressure loss can be tolerated and the overall joint enve- lope must be kept as small as possible. The following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [ 4], shows the internal tripod joint non-jacketed (left) and jacketed (right)."
What materials are used for the joints in the low-pressure discharge duct of the oxidiser?," 696 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures According to the data given in [ 4], these joints are made of Inconel®718 and ARMCO 21-6-9 stainless steel, and their design life is 200 operational, 1400 non- operational full de flection cycles. The non-jacketed joint is used for the low-pressure discharge duct of the oxidiser."
What is the inside diameter of the system in millimeters?," It works at an operating pressure of 2.916 MPa and at an operating temperature of 92.04 K. Its inside diameter is 160 mm, and its angular displacement is ±0.2269 rad ( ±13°). The jacketed joint is used for the low-pressure discharge duct of the fuel. It works at an operating pressure of 1.924 MPa and at an operating temperature of 22."
What is the range of internal diameters suitable for the ducts used in the RS-25 engine's externally-tied gimbal ring joint?,"04 K. Its inside diameter is 132 mm, and its angular displacement is ±0.2007 rad ( ±11°30′). The externally-tied gimbal ring joint used in the RS-25 engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. This joint is used in the RS-25 engine on small-diameter (50.80–68.58 mm) high- pressure ducts, where the pressure losses associated with internal ties are not accept- able."
What component provides lateral support to stabilize long bellows in externally-tied joints?," The high pressures and gimbal angles of the externally-tied joints make it necessary to use long bellows, which are unstable in column buckling. 7.7 Bellows Joints 697 This joint is stabilised by a linkage, shown in the preceding figure, which provides lateral support at the mid-span of the bellows live length."
How is angular deflection managed in the joint assembly of the Shuttle Orbiter's fuel and oxidiser drain ducts?," By so doing, the angular de flection of the joint assembly is equally distributed between the two bellows. A fl e x i b l ej o i n tw i t hl i n k a g er e s t r a i n tk n o w na s“ G i m b a r ”( g i m b a lr i n gw i t h crossed bars for structural strength) is used in the fuel and oxidiser drain ducts of the Shuttle Orbiter."
What type of joint is lighter than a gimbal ring joint and suitable for large diameter ducts with low fluid velocities?," This joint is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. This joint is lighter than a gimbal ring joint having internal or external ties, and can be used in ducts of large diameters carrying fluids moving at low velocities, in which the pressure loss due to the structure across the flow stream can be tolerated."
What is the purpose of thrust-compensating bellows in relation to axial thrust?," This joint is also capable of carrying torsional loads, by means of its linkage. Thrust-compensating bellows are sometimes necessary to offset the thrust of primary bellows. An example of thrust-compensating bellows is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. 698 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures In a thrust-compensating bellows, the axial thrust due to the pressure separating force is balanced by the compensating bellows."
What role do thrust-compensating bellows play in relation to volumetric changes in straight-run gimballing ducts?," Of course, in order to compensate for thrust, the volume of the bellows must also be compensated. Thrust-compensating bellows also eliminate volumetric changes which occur in straight-run gimballing ducts. Such changes cause pressure perturbations which are detrimental to engine operation. In the duct at the inlet of the pump of the F-1 engine, a bellows (which is external to and concentric with the main bellows) offsets the separating force of the main bellows, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]."
What components are utilized to secure the bellows in the annular chamber described?," The annular chamber is vented to internal duct pressure. Axial-tension rods tie across the bellows alternately along the circumference. Telescopic flow sleeves can also be provided [ 1]. Bellows joints are also used in compression systems. A compression system consists of one or more bellows having no tension ties, which are used to absorb the de flections of a duct in operating conditions."
What effect can eccentric pressure separating forces have on the engine's support structure in compression-restrained bellows?," In a compression system, the mating structure of the engine reacts to the pressure separating forces and to the elastic forces due to the fluid moving in the duct. The reaction exerted by the mating structure places the duct in compression. 7.7 Bellows Joints 699 In engines having ducts with compression-restrained bellows (for example, low- pressure ducts, such as those at the outlet of turbines), the support structure of the engine can be overloaded with moments caused by eccentric pressure separating forces acting on the bellows."
What happens to shear stresses in bellows when they are installed with opposing deflections in operational conditions?," These moments cause shear stresses in the bellows. When the de flections induced in a bellows in operational conditions are known, then that bellows con be installed in an engine with a bias which gives rise to opposite de flections. By so doing, the bellows move, when placed in operational conditions, toward a nearly neutral position, corresponding to little or no stress."
What manufacturing techniques are essential for joining bellows to adjacent thicker components?," An installation of a compressed-restrained bellows made according to this criterion is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. As has been shown above, bellows are made of thin, sometimes laminated, and often dissimilar materials. Consequently, junctions between bellows and adja- cent parts of higher thickness require the use of careful manufacturing techniques."
What welding techniques are advantageous for joining dissimilar metals with varying thicknesses without affecting heat treatments?, Electron-beam welding and diffusion bonding (discussed in paragraph 4) offer advan- tages over other techniques when parts made of dissimilar metals and having different thicknesses are to be joined. Bellows made of heat-treatable alloys can be welded to ducts made of non-heat- treatable alloys without disturbing the heat treatments in the bellows materials.
What are the two main types of welds associated with bellows in the RS-25 engine?," For this purpose, a transition portion of the duct is welded to the bellows before heat treating the bellows material, so that the final weld to the duct involves identical alloys. In the RS-25 engine, the welds of the bellows to the ducts are of two principal types: (a) welds for thin-wall bellows subject to low pressures; and 700 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures (b) welds for thick-wall bellows subject to high pressures."
What type of welding is used to join the bellows to the end rings after trimming?," The necks of the thin-wall bellows are resistance-welded together, then trimmed around the circumference through the centre of the nugget. The bellows is then electron-beam welded to end rings, and the resultant assembly is heat treated. The two types of welds indicated above are shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 1]."
What is the primary purpose of internal flow liners in bellows?, Internal flow liners or sleeves for bellows are used to solve the problem of fatigue failures of bellows. Such failures are due to vibrations induced by the fluid stream. Flow liners are also used to reduce the pressure losses which occur at the joints. Flow liners have been used as structural members supporting tube coils in heat exchangers mounted on the J-2 and J-2S engines.
What design feature prevents flow liners from binding at maximum bellows excursion?," Flow liners must be designed so that they should not bottom out or bind on either the bellows or the ducts, when the bellows are at the maximum limits of excursion. They must also be designed with drain holes placed as near as possible to the weld attachment, in order to make it possible to remove cleaning fluids and contaminants."
What design modification was implemented to address fatigue failures in flow liners?," Fatigue failures of flow liners have occurred, in which cracks have appeared in the trailing edge and in the weld joint. These failures have been attributed to vibrations of the cantilevered end of the sleeve. This problem has been solved by an increase in the thickness of the wall, with a consequent increase in the rigidity of the liner [ 1]."
What effect do vent holes have on the pressure difference across a liner's wall?," Collapse of liners has also occurred as a result of pressure on the outer diameter of the liner exceeding that of the inner diameter. This has been attributed to sudden changes in flow rates, which cause a different static pressure across the wall of the liner. Vent holes in the liner can reduce some of this difference of pressure, Otherwise, the liner can be strengthened to withstand the applied load."
What are the components that make up a flexible hose as described?," Some typical con figurations for flow liners are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. 7.7 Bellows Joints 701 7.8 Flexible Hoses A fl e x i b l eh o s ec o n s i s t so fa fl e x i b l ei n n e rl i n e rw h i c hc o n d u c t sa fl u i d ,ar e i n f o r c e - ment which braces the inner liner, and two end fittings, which connect the hose ends to other portions of a duct."
Why are flexible hoses more commonly utilized in large liquid-propellant rocket engines compared to smaller engines?," Flexible hoses are used more often in large liquid-propellant rocket engines (meant for boosters and upper stages) than in small engines (meant for attitude control or reaction control). This is because little flexibility is required in lines of small engines, which are not mounted on gimbals and use storable propellants."
What type of hoses are utilized for the fluid-carrying lines in the J-2 engine?," The J-2 and F-1 engines (both of which have been used in the Saturn V launch vehicle) have many fluid-carrying lines between the engine and the vehicle. These lines are flexible, in order for the engine to be moved on gimbals. On the J-2 engine, all the lines are flexible hoses and are clamped together to assist in maintaining their relative positions."
What is the purpose of using coiled tubing in heat exchangers?," On the F-1 engine, the flexible hoses cross the gimbal plane and are attached to non-gimballing flexible hoses on the engine [ 1]. Coiled tubing is sometimes used in heat exchangers for tank pressurisation. This is done in order to provide the maximum area possible for heat transfer in the minimum space."
What is the maximum diameter of the coiled tube used for pneumatic lines in the Centaur stage?," In the Centaur stage, a coiled tube is used for the pneumatic lines to the main engines, and flexible bends in lines for propellant recirculation and in lines for tank pressurisation, all of which are less than or equal to 25.4 mm in diameter [ 1]. 702 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures At y p i c a la s s e m b l yo f fl e x i b l eh o s e si ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et ot h e courtesy of NASA [ 1]."
What configuration allows maximum motion of the line while minimizing movement of flexible hose sections in a gimbal system?," The flexible hose sections shown in the preceding figure are located so as to achieve the maximum motion possible of the line with the minimum motion of the flexible hose sections. In addition, the entire wraparound lies in the gimbal plane rather than passing through it. The preceding figure illustrates a gimbal system mounted on the head of the thrust chamber for thrust vector control."
What orientation do the midpoints of the two flexible hose sections have in relation to the gimbal axes?," The longitudinal axes of two of the three flexible hose sections are located in the gimbal plane. The midpoint of each of these two flexible hose sections is located on each of the two gimbal axes. The third flexible hose section is located in the vertical direction, to provide universal motion of one end of the line with respect to the other."
What measures are taken to support flexible hoses when they cannot withstand mechanical vibrations or acceleration loads?," This method of locating the flexible hose sections limits their motions to the gimbal angles only, in order to reduce bending stresses and consequent fatigue. When the hoses are not stiff enough to resist motions caused by either mechanical vibrations or accelerations load, then clamps and support brackets are used [ 1]."
What configuration is used for flexible hoses in the J-2 engine when space limitations occur?," Other arrangements for flexible hoses than the wraparound arrangement described above have been used, when lack of available space made it necessary to do so. For example, the flexible lines of the J-2 engine at the interface between the engine and 7.8 Flexible Hoses 703 the vehicle have been arranged in a U-shaped routing con figuration, with a section of braided flexible hose in each leg of the U, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]."
What velocity limit is established for gases in flexible hoses to prevent pressure losses and flow-induced vibrations?," Flexible hoses are sized so that the velocities of gases are kept below the value 0.3 of the Mach number. This avoids pressure losses and vibrations induced by the flow. The inner core of a flexible hose is subject to vibrations caused by the flow and by mechanical parts, as is the case with a bellows (see paragraph 7), the only difference being that the braid of a flexible hose restrains the corrugations to vibrate individually."
What materials are generally utilized for the inner cores of flexible hoses in rocket engines and why?," Other considerations concerning pressure carried, resistance to corrosion, manufac- turing methods, and handling protection for flexible hoses are similar to those which have been discussed in paragraph 7 for bellows. As a general rule, only metallic materials are used for inner cores of flexible hoses installed in rocket engines, due to the very high or very low temperatures reached in such engines."
"What type of inner core is most commonly used, and which type is not utilized in aerospace applications?"," Some exceptions to this rule are cited below. The type most frequently used is the metallic, annularly convoluted inner core. The metallic, helically convoluted inner core type is not used in aerospace applications. Rolled and welded tubes or seamless tubes are used, but those of the seamless type are much more expensive."
What types of Teflon® have been successfully used in the engines of the Titan III?, The welds of those of the rolled and welded type require X-ray and leakage veri fications before use. The engines of the Titan III have used successfully inner cores of both normal and carbon-impregnated Te flon®(poly-tetra fluoroethylene) in sizes ranging from 9.525 704 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures to 25.
What material was utilized for the airborne hydraulic system in the Centaur?,"4 mm in diameter. On the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, inner cores of Te flon®have been used successfully with RP-1 at a working pressure of 15.17 MPa. Inner cores made of Te flon®have also been used successfully for the airborne hydraulic system on the Centaur. Rubber has been used only for applications involving non-cryogenic or non-high temperatures."
How do low bending moments affect the loads on actuators in relation to flexible hoses?," In addition, the quality of rubber is subject to deterioration with time. Bending moments to flexible hoses are to be considered, because the components adjacent to a hose are loaded. Low values of bending moments are desirable, because low bending moments applied to flexible hoses which cross the gimbal plane result in low loads applied to the actuators which gimbal the engines."
What effect does axial compression of an inner core have on convolutions per unit length and bending stiffness?," Bending moments can be reduced by using lubricants applied to braid wires and to the other surfaces of the inner core. An inner core may be compressed axially before installing the braid. This results in a higher number of convolutions per unit length and in a lower bending stiffness, but also in greater weight and cost of the materials."
What role does the braid play in the design of flexible hoses regarding the inner core's stability?," A compressed inner core also improves the ability of a flexible hose to withstand pressure impulses. Buckling stability is not a concern in the design of flexible hoses. This is because the support provided by the braid for the inner core prevents buckling. The braid of a flexible hose is a woven tubular cover, which restrains the inner core against elongation and gives it lateral support and protection."
What material is used to weave the braid that absorbs the load in flexible hoses for rocket engines?," The braid absorbs the entire separating load of a flexible hose. In rocket engines, the braid is woven of wire made of stainless steel. Tubular braid may be woven directly on the inner core of flexible hoses. Sections of braid are cut at a length slightly greater than the length of the convoluted inner core."
What must the braid weave pattern prevent to ensure proper function within design limits?," A tensile load is applied to the ends of the braid section, and the section is attached to end fittings by brazing or welding [ 1]. The pattern of a braid weave must be such as to prevent the wires from binding or bottoming out, within the design limits of angular de flection for a particular section of flexible hose."
What is the relationship between the braid angle and the pitch in flexible hose configurations?," Typical con figurations of braids used for flexible hoses are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 1]. 7.8 Flexible Hoses 705 The braid angle or helix angle δshown in the preceding figure is the angle whose tangent is the pitch divided by the circumferential length of the braid per pitch."
What angle is assumed to provide maximum flexibility for flexible hoses with a metallic inner core?, The pitch is the axial distance taken by any given wire to make one complete turn. An angle δof about π/4 (45°) is presumed to give the maximum flexibility together with good end strength and resistance to pressure for flexible hoses with metallic inner core [ 1]. 706 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Multiple layers of braid may be used to achieve greater strength.
What is the assumed efficiency of the second layer according to the provided information?," The second layer is assumed to have an ef ficiency (see below) of about 80%, due to the dif ficulty of obtaining a perfect distribution of load between two layers. Tubular braid is available in various metals and sizes up to 457.2 mm in diam- eter. The ultimate tensile strength of a braid wire made of stainless steel is about 827."
What does FB represent in the formula provided for calculating the end strength of a braid?,"4 MPa, but braid wires of higher strength can also be found [ 1]. The end strength FB(N) of a braid can be calculated by using the following formula of [ 1]: FB=nFwBesinδ where nis the total number of wires in a braid, Fw(N) is the strength of a single wire in a braid, Beis the braid ef ficiency factor (whose values are 0."
What is the formula for calculating the effective area of a bellows-type metallic braided hose?,"93 for an annealed wire, 0.85 for a hard-drawn wire, and 0.80 for a second layer), and δis the braid angle de fined above. The burst pressure is the maximum pressure which a hose can retain without losing pressure or fluid. The burst pressure pb(N/m2)of a bellows-type metallic braided hose can be calculated by using the following formula of [ 1]: pb=FB Aeff where FB(N) is the end strength of a braid de fined above, and Aeff(m2)is the effective area of the bellows, which results from Aeff=πD2 m 4 andDm(m) is the mean diameter of the bellows, such that Dm=(Do+Di)/2, where Do(m) and Di(m) are respectively the outside diameter and the inside diameter of the bellows."
What is the formula to approximate the elongation of a braid under internal pressure?," The elongation ξ(m) of the braid, when a flexible hose is under pressure, can be calculated approximately by using the following formula of [ 1]: ξ=piℓAeff nEA w where pi(N/m2)is the internal pressure, ℓ(m) is the total length of one braid wire between its end connexions, E(N/m2)is the Young modulus of a braid wire, and Aw(m2)is the cross-sectional area of each wire."
What types of materials are used in the flexible hoses for the RS-25 main engines of the Space Shuttle?," The preceding equation includes no allowance for slack in the wires, and holds when the stress is within the elastic limit. Braid wires are subject to corrosion. As a result of the experience gained for the main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, the braid materials for the flexible hoses used in those engines have been nickel-base alloys."
What are the two main types of end construction for small diameter flexible hoses based on temperature ranges?," 7.8 Flexible Hoses 707 There are two principal types of end construction used for flexible hoses of small diameter: (a) a welded-and-brazed type, used at temperatures from cryogenic to 478 K; and (b) an all-welded type, used at temperatures above 478 K. These two types are shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 1]."
What components are involved in the construction endpoint described for hoses?," By end construction we mean a juncture of inner core, tube adapter, and braid. The all-welded type is required at high temperatures, because of the loss of strength of the braze material at such temperatures. These two types have been used for flexible hoses up to 76.2 mm in diameter [ 1]. In case of tubes whose internal diameter (ID) exceeded 76."
What is the temperature range for the type of end construction used in hoses of large inner diameters?,"2 mm, another type of end construction has been used at temperatures from cryogenic to 478 K. This type (c) is shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 1]. 708 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures The type of construction illustrated in the preceding figure has been used in hoses of large inner diameters (88."
What was the internal diameter of the tube in relation to the lap weld of the pressure-carrier neck?,"9 and 101.6 mm) developed for the gimballing feed systems of the engines of the Atlas and Thor rocket vehicles. In such engines, the internal diameter of the tube was large enough to permit a lap weld of the pressure- carrier neck to the tube adapter [ 1]. Two further examples of end construction are shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 1]."
What factors influence the bending moments needed for braided metallic hoses?," The moments required to de flect braided metallic hoses depend on numerous parameters, such as inner diameter, outer diameter, thickness of the inner core, number of plies, live length, number of layers of braid, number of wires and their diameters, and operating pressure. Data on the bending moments can be obtained from the manufacturers of flexible hoses or by test."
What feature is essential for extending the service life of a flexible hose according to the guide?," Some typical values can be found in [1]. Ag u i d ee n a b l e sa fl e x i b l eh o s et ob e n d ,m o v e ,a n do p e r a t ei nm o r et h a no n ep l a n e without twisting, in order for the hose to have a longer service life. This guide has proved successful under severe conditions. Two independent bends are curved one 7."
What is the significance of the neutral length of hose in maintaining separation between bends in flexible hoses?,"8 Flexible Hoses 709 in a horizontal plane, and the other in the vertical plane. The guide provides a neutral length of hose which separates the bends and prevents interactions between them, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 15]. Determination of the minimal neutral distance required for proper operation led to the identi fication of a single theoretical point of in flection, where the hose becomes free of the guide."
What role does the roller serve in relation to the hoses in the assembly?," A roller, for each hose in the assembly, is placed in this point. The inherent stiffness of the hose makes this point the point of in flection between the horizontal bend and the vertical bend. Each bend is curved in a single plane with no components of rotation or twist along the axis of the hose. The arrangement shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 15], can be modi fied for other motions of the hose."
What is the primary purpose of filters in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines?," 710 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures 7.9 Filters As has been shown in paragraph 1, filters are often installed in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines to retain solid particles of contaminants which may be contained in the fluids. Downstream of filters, the size of the remaining solid particles is reduced to such an extent as not to affect the performance of components sensitive to contam- inants."
What are the three primary sources of contaminating particles in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines?," Examples of such components are valves and actuators. According to Buck- ingham and Winzel [ 16], contaminating particles existing in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines are due to three principal causes, which are: •residual manufacturing debris in the tanks and in other parts of a fluid system; •contaminating particles in the on-loaded fluids; and •particles generated by the wear of components in normal operation."
What is the primary mechanism employed in surface filtration for retaining solid particles?," Generally speaking, as has been shown by Howell and Weathers [ 2], there are two techniques of filtration, which are brie fly described below. One of them, called surface filtration, is accomplished by impingement and reten- tion of solid particles on a matrix of pores placed in a single planar or curved surface."
What does the filtration method effectively collect based on particle size relative to pore sizes?," Filtration occurs only at that surface, and the particles which are not stopped there 7.9 Filters 711 pass through the filtering medium with no further change in direction. This technique of filtration is effective in collecting particles larger than the sizes of the pores, but not effective in collecting fibres and particles smaller than the sizes of the pores."
"What are two techniques of filtration mentioned, and how do they differ fundamentally in their methods?"," Its capability of retaining solid particles is limited by the area of the surface which can be provided within a given envelope. Examples of surface filtration media are single-layer mesh screens, stacked washers, wound metallic ribbons, and sheets of perforated metals. The other technique, called depth filtration, is accomplished by impingement and retention of solid particles in a matrix of pores placed in depth."
What mechanisms contribute to the retention of solid particles in a depth filtering medium like sand?," Sand is a typical example of a depth filtering medium, in which the filtering action consists of absorp- tion and entrapment of solid particles at random. Solid particles are retained not only at the surface, but also throughout the thickness of the filtering medium. The particles which pass through a matrix of pores are forced to change direction in a tortuous path."
What factors influence the ability of depth filters to collect solid particles smaller than their largest pore size?," Depth filters are effective in collecting solid particles larger than the maximum size of the pores and fibres. They can also collect a portion of solid particles smaller than the largest size of the pores, depending on the type and on the thickness of the filtering medium. Their capability per unit area of retaining solid particles is large, because the particles are retained not only on the surface but also throughout the depth of the filtering medium."
What are some types of materials used in depth filtration media?," Examples of depth filtration media are multiple layers of mesh, wounded wire cylinders, stacked discs of paper, sintered granulated materials, multiple layers of cloth, compressed or matted organic or inorganic fibres, stacked discs of etched metallic sheet, materials of elastic foam with open pores, and stacked membranes [ 2]."
What materials are used in surface filters and depth filters for rocket engine ducts?," In the particular case of filters used in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines, most surface filters are made of woven wire cloth, and most depth filters are made of stacked etched metallic discs. In a filter made of woven wire cloth, the filtering medium is woven from strands of metal. A type of wave is plain square wave, in which the strands pass over and under each other in alternating sequence."
What weaving pattern is described for twilled square wave mesh in terms of how strands pass over and under?," Another type is twilled square wave, in which the strands pass “over two, under two” in a staggered pattern. In both cases, the resultant openings are square-shaped [ 16]. Woven wire cloth, also known as woven wire mesh, is woven on looms, by using a process similar to that used to weave clothing. The mesh uses one or another of various crimping pattern for the interlocking segments."
What type of weave is predominantly used for woven wire cloth with square openings?," Square mesh, described above, is the most common type of mesh. The plain weave is the most common weave for woven wire cloth with a square opening in the plain weave. Materials used are austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. This type of filter is suitable for non-critical hydraulic, pneumatic, and propellant feed applications [ 2]."
What is the structural resemblance of an etched-disc filter described in the material?," The following figure, adapted from [ 16], shows a wire cloth pleated conical filter. 712 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures An etched-disc filter is a stack of segments resembling thin washers. Each segment has one face chemically etched to provide a desired flow path, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 16], where all dimensions are expressed in millimetres."
How are the segments in the stack arranged to create flow passages in a filter?," The non-etched face of each segment in the stack is in contact with the etched face of the next adjacent segment, so that the etched areas form minute passages for the flow. The stack of segments is held rigidly by a supporting cage and is tightly compressed. The depth property of an etched disc filter is obtained by compelling 7."
What cleaning method is used for an etched disc filter after releasing compression on the segments?,"9 Filters 713 the solid particles to cross the surface of each segment through a tortuous path. An etched disc filter can be cleaned by releasing the compression on the segments and back- flushing. This type of filter is suitable for critical hydraulic, pneumatic, and propellant feed applications. Recent advances in wire cloth filter technology have broadened the field of choice for critical applications."
What is the unique material composition of the etched disc filter for filtering particles smaller than 8 × 10 - 6m[2]?," However, the etched disc filter remains the only filter made only of metal which can be used for filtering particles below 8 ×10 - 6m[2]. Af u l l - fl o we t c h e d - d i s c fi l t e r ,d e v e l o p e db yC a l t e c h / J P L[ 17], has fluid passage- ways in a con figuration which allows very low restriction of flow and has also stagna- tion areas for the collection of impurities."
What design feature of the filter housing enhances flow characteristics and eliminates central post presence?, A filter housing without a central post has also been developed to improve the flow characteristics. The full- flow etched-disc filter produces a zero reversal of flow and a very low drop of pressure. A perma- nently sealed (welded) filter housing without a central post has improved the flow characteristics.
What is the main feature of the fluid channels in the etched-disc filter element?," The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 17], shows an etched-disc filter element consisting essentially of a thin metallic disc with shallow, radially-disposed, etched, fluid channels incorporating stagnation areas located away from the main flow streams. Fluid may flow in either direction."
What function do the inner alignment tabs on the discs serve regarding orientation?," The discs have inner alignment tabs, which ensure proper front-to-back orientation, and outer alignment tabs, which keep the discs aligned within a housing. The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [ 17], shows: (above) how the discs are oriented, front-to-back, so that the non-etched surfaces are adjacent to the aligned etched channels; and (below) the assembled etched-disc filter."
What advantages do wire-mesh filters have over stacked etched disc filters regarding surface area and flow rates?," 714 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Of various metals used for filters, stainless steel is the most common. Filters of the wire-mesh type have, in comparison with those made of stacked etched discs, the advantages of: •greater surface area with lower weight; and •capability of handling higher flow rates."
What types of components can have filter cavities machined into their bodies?," Filters and filter elements are covered by the military standards MIL-F-5504B [18]a n dM I L - F - 8 8 1 5 D[ 19]. Some standard filter elements and filter cases used in hydraulic systems for aircraft are illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 2]. As shown in this figure, filter cavities can also be machined in the body of a component such as a servo-cylinder, ap u m p ,o rar e g u l a t o r ."
What factors must be considered in the design of a filter case to ensure optimal performance?,"A fi l t e rc a s ep r o v i d e ss t r u c t u r a ls u p p o r tf o ra fi l t e re l e m e n t . The design of a filter case takes account of space available, easiness of access and service, pressure loss, fluid compatibility, and pressure and temperature in operating conditions. The size and the shape of a filter case have in fluence on the capacity and the service life of the filter."
What is the distinguishing feature of the T-type filter compared to the in-line filter regarding filter element access?," 7.9 Filters 715 The choice of a type of filter case depends on requirements of accessibility. The in-line filter case is the least accessible type of filter. It requires the removal of the case from the piping system before a filter element can be removed. The T-type, also known as pot type, is designed so that the filter element can be removed by removing the filter pot."
What design feature allows for the removal of the filter element in a Y-type filter?," The Y-type is designed so that the filter element can be removed through one leg of the Y, by removing a blank flange or a cover plate. The seal used for a filter is particularly important in case of mechanical vibra- tions. In critical propellant feed applications, internal seals should be avoided when- ever possible, due to compatibility of materials and generation of particles during assembly."
What types of devices are utilized to seal the filter element at its junction with the case?," Such devices as supporting cages, bolts, nuts, and O-rings are used to seal the filter element at its interface with the case. The seals or the locking devices used in filters are designed so as to avoid damages due to parts of filters which may migrate downstream. Some filters have a pressure indicator which senses abnormal high differences in pressure across a filter element."
What component opens to bypass the filter when pressure difference surpasses a specified threshold in lubrication and hydraulic systems?," This device may sometimes indicate a high difference in pressure where a liquid and a gas flow intermittently. This may happen in ducts carrying cryogenic fluids. Some filters used in lubrication and hydraulic ducts have a built-in by-pass valve, which opens and by-passes the filter when the difference in pressure across it exceeds ag i v e nv a l u e ."
What is the main reason this device is seldom utilized in rocket engines?,"T h i sd e v i c ei si n c o r p o r a t e di nt h e fi l t e r ,b e c a u s ei ti sb e t t e ri ns o m e cases to keep a fluid-carrying duct working with a contaminated fluid than to have ac o m p l e t ef a i l u r ed u et ol a c ko f fl u i dw h e nt h e fi l t e rb e c o m e sp l u g g e d .T h i sd e v i c e is rarely used in rocket engines which operate for a very brief period of time, and therefore the level of contamination in these filters cannot grow appreciably during their operating time."
What are the five cleaning methods listed for interconnecting components and structures?, A fi l t e rc a nb ec l e a n e di no n eo rm o r eo ft h ef o l l o w i n gm a n n e r s : 716 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures •back- flushing; •ultrasonic cleaning; • flushing; •purging; and •initial cleaning. Ab r i e fd e s c r i p t i o no ft h e s em e t h o d si sg i v e nb e l o w .
What occurs after reversing the flow direction through a filter element?," Back- flushing results from reversing the direction of flow through a filtering element, with consequent flushing of solid particles from the inlet side of the filter. This method removes loose particles, but not those which are tightly fixed within the porous medium. Therefore, back- flushing must be followed by other methods to restore a filter element to its original conditions of cleanliness."
What process occurs to solid particles on a filter element when ultrasonic waves are applied while it is immersed in a solvent solution?," Ultrasonic cleanliness consists in immersing a filter element in a tank containing as o l v e n ts o l u t i o n ,a n da p p l y i n gu l t r a s o n i cw a v e st ot h i ss o l u t i o nb ym e a n so ft r a n s - ducers mounted on or within the tank. The ultrasonic waves produce cavitation on the surface of the filter element immersed in the solution, and this in turn loosens solid particles on the filter element."
What method uses dry gas to remove residual solvent from a filter element after cleaning?," Flushing a filter element in the normal direction of flow, after applying back- flushing or ultrasonic cleaning, removes the solid particles which have previously been loosened and improves the degree of cleanliness. Purging consists in using a pre- filtered dry gas, such as air or nitrogen, which passes through a filter element to dry it and to also remove residual solvent which may be left by previous cleaning processes."
What cleaning methods are mentioned as being more effective than purging a filter element?," Purging a filter element is often less effective than ultrasonic cleaning and back- flushing. Initial cleaning of a new filter element is necessary, because solid particles may have been introduced during manufacture and assembly of the filter into the filter element and also into the filter case. Ultrasonic cleaning, flushing, and back- flushing may be combined together to reach a desired level of cleanliness in a filter element."
What factors determine the selection of a filter for use in a fluid-carrying duct for a rocket engine?," Cloth elements made of stainless steel can reach a higher degree of initial clean- liness by applying acid passivation after assembly, or by annealing the assembly in an environment of hydrogen [ 2]. The choice of a particular type of filter to be used for a speci fic application depends on: •largest size of solid particles which can be tolerated by the components of a fluid-carrying duct; •amount and type of solid particles which may be contained in a fluid during the service life of a given rocket engine; •maximum loss of pressure due to the presence of a given filter; and •space available within a fluid-carrying duct."
"What determines the maximum size of solid particles allowed in a component, such as a valve or actuator?"," 7.9 Filters 717 The maximum allowable size of solid particles in a given component (for example, av a l v eo ras e r v o - a c t u a t o r )c a nb ed e t e r m i n e db ye v a l u a t i n gt h ec l e a r a n c e so rt h e sizes of narrow passages in the given component which are sensitive to contaminants."
What factors make it challenging to predict the types and quantities of solid particles affecting the component's performance?," For this purpose, it is necessary to determine the possible malfunctions of the given component caused by the entrapment of solid particles carried by the fluid. The amount and the type of solid particles during service life is dif ficult to deter- mine, because of uncertainties in the prediction of: (a) amount of solid particles which remain after cleaning a given component and its filter; (b) amount of solid particles which are carried by the fluid; and (c) fluids and temperatures in operational conditions, which may differ from those of the tests conducted in laboratories."
What factors must be analyzed to determine the optimal installation of a filter in a duct system?, The maximum loss of pressure due to a given filter and the space available within the given duct can result from a system analysis and a trade-off study to determine whether it is more advantageous to install a filter mounted externally to the component to be protected or a filter forming an integral part of the component itself.
"What term describes the maximum size of solid particles a filter can transmit, indicating its protective capability for components downstream?", The largest size of solid particles which can be transmitted through a filter is expressed by a parameter known as filter rating. This parameter measures the degree of protection which a filter provides for downstream components. Several types of filter rating are speci fied by filters manufacturers.
What does the maximum particle size rating measure in terms of filter specifications?," One of them is the maximum particle size rating (MPR), which is the longest dimension, in microns, of any solid particle allowed downstream of a filter. Another type of filter rating is the absolute rating, also known as glass bead rating (GBR), which is the size, in microns, of the largest hard spherical particle (i."
What shape do all solid particles need to be considered for absolute filter rating according to the definition provided?,"e., glass bead) which would be removed by the filter under steady flow conditions [ 16]. In other words, the de finition of absolute filter rating considers all solid particles to have spherical shape, and requires a filter to retain all solid particles whose diameter is greater than or equal to a speci fied value."
What does the nominal rating evaluate in relation to filter performance?," Therefore, the absolute rating takes account only of the second largest dimension of any solid particle which can be transmitted through a filter. Still another type of filter rating is the nominal rating, which assesses the ability of a filter to remove a speci fied percentage (in either count or weight) of spherical solid particles or graded dust whose size is equal to or greater than the value de fined by its absolute rating."
What is the relationship between a filter's nominal rating and its absolute rating?," Therefore, the nominal rating of a given filter is always less than its absolute rating. The maximum particle size rating can be determined by test. The test is conducted by using a readily identi fiable contaminant with particles of various sizes and shapes. Ap r o c e d u r ef o rd e t e r m i n i n gt h em a x i m u mp a r t i c l es i z er a t i n gi sd e s c r i b e di n[ 16]."
What type of test is used to determine the absolute rating of a filter with artificial contaminant?," The absolute rating of a filter also can be determined by test. A test is conducted by filtration of an arti ficial contaminant (glass beads) under speci fied conditions, as described in [ 19]. The nominal average rating of a filter can be determined by means of a mercury intrusion test, which is described in [ 20]."
What type of test is used to verify absolute rating for production filters in correlation with a glass bead test?," 718 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures Maximum particle size tests are not practical for acceptance testing of production filters. The glass bead test is a destructive type of test, and therefore is never used as an acceptance test. However, correlation of a glass bead test with a non-destructive bubble-point test permits veri fication of absolute rating for production filters [ 1]."
How is the diameter of the largest pore in a filter determined using a liquid and air pressure measurement?," The bubble-point test is based on the fact that, for a given liquid and for a given size of pores with a constant wetting, the pressure necessary to force a bubble of air through a pore is inversely proportional to the diameter of the pore. In other words, the diameter of the largest pore in a filter can be measured by wetting the filter element with a liquid and then measuring the pressure at which the first stream of bubbles is emitted from the upper surface of the filter element, when air is introduced to the open end."
What determines the size of the largest pore in relation to the pressure of bubble emergence?," The pressure at which the first stream of bubbles emerges is taken as a measure of the diameter of the largest pore. The value of the constant of inverse proportionality between pressure and diameter is determined experimentally. Further information on the bubble-point test can be found, fir example, in [ 16,21]."
What standards govern the bubble-point test according to the provided information?," The bubble-point test is covered by the standards ISO 4003:1977 [ 22]a n dA R P9 0 1 A[ 23]. As has been shown above, a filter is necessary to reduce the size of solid particles carried in suspension by an operating fluid to a level which cannot cause damage to critical components of a duct. The determination of the filter area required for this purpose is based on an accurate prediction of the amount of contaminant which can be expected for any given application."
What factors may contribute to the lack of correlation between predicted and actual contamination levels?," The problem of accurately predicting the actual degree of contamination is still open. So far, there appears to be no correlation between the actual and the predicted amounts, sizes, and types of contamination [ 1]. The reason of this may be the variation in techniques used in manufacturing and building components and assemblies."
What type of contaminants are commonly used to test the effectiveness of a filter in maintaining pressure differences?," In this state of things, for the purpose of demonstrating that a filter of suf ficient area has been provided for a given application, a speci fied amount of contaminant is required to be retained by the filter, without exceeding some maximum difference of pressure between its inlet and outlet. The contaminants most frequently used are AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts."
What is the purpose of the Natural Arizona Dusts in relation to filter evaluation?, These test dusts are Natural Arizona Dusts supplied by General Motors Phoenix Laboratory and classi fied to speci fic particle-size distri- butions by the AC Spark Plug Division of General Motors Corporation [ 1]. Further information on AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts can be found in [ 24]. The two dusts named above provide a baseline material for evaluating the ability of a filter to retain particles on its upstream side under flow conditions.
What do residual contaminants in a filter refer to after the cleaning process?," Buckingham and Winzen [ 16] gives further information on tests which were conducted to determine the tolerance of various filter materials to contaminants for both gaseous and liquid flow. Residual contaminants, that is, contaminants remaining in a filter after cleaning, may slough off and pass downstream of the filter."
What factors influence the quantity of contaminants removed from a filter during the cleaning procedure?," As has been shown above, such contaminants may accumulate in a filter during its manufacturing process, or be introduced there by the operating fluid, or be generated by the wear of mechanical components. 7.9 Filters 719 Ac l e a n i n go fa fi l t e rr e m o v e sap a r to fc o n t a m i n a n t sf r o mt h e fi l t e r ,t h ea m o u n t of this part depending on the accuracy of the cleaning process."
"What are two factors that should be reduced during fabrication, assembly, and testing to minimize costs in the process?"," Since this process is expensive, sometimes more expensive than the manufacturing process, then it is desirable to reduce the amount of contaminants which accumulate during fabrication, assembly, and testing. It is also desirable to reduce media migration, that is, the presence in the operating fluid of contaminants coming from either the filter element or the filter-supporting structure."
What is the primary testing method for evaluating media migration in filter materials?," Filter materials subject to media migration are sintered porous metals, pressed paper, matted fibres, glass fibres, sintered plastic, fired porcelain, bonded carbon, and bonded stone [ 1,2]. One of the most common tests for media migration combines thermal shock with vibration. In this test, a filter is exposed to its highest service temperature for a period of time and then to its lowest service temperature for an equal period."
What is the purpose of flushing the filter with fluid after the thermal shock and vibration procedure?," This procedure is repeated several times. After this thermal shock, the filter is caused to vibrate at frequencies of service for a given period of time. After testing, the filter is flushed with a given amount of fluid (usually 500 ml of either Freon TF or some ozone-friendly substitute for it), and the fluid is collected and passed through a 0."
What indicates that no media migration has occurred during the analysis of the membrane pad?,"45µmembrane pad. The membrane pad is then analysed for particles identi fiable as material coming from either the filter element or the filter-supporting structure. When all of the particles are non-metallic and the filter is made entirely of metal, then no media migration has occurred. When some of the particles are metallic, then further analysis is required, and the filter material must be distinguished from residual contaminants [ 1]."
What contributes more to pressure loss: filter medium or filter entrance and exit in a surface type filter element?," Individual particles taken from a representative sample of the pad can be identi fied by microscopic examination. The problem of determining the loss of pressure ∆pthrough a filter as a function of its volumetric flow rate qis dif ficult to solve. In case of a filter element of the surface type, the pressure loss across the filter medium for either fine or coarse mesh is small in comparison with the pressure loss at filter entrance or exit."
What equation can be utilized to evaluate filter properties in relation to pressure loss and volumetric flow rate?," In practice, the problem indicated above can be solved by tests which make it possible to plot curves of pressure loss against volumetric flow rate. One of the formulae which can be used for determining the properties of a filter is known as the Kozeny-Carman equation [ 25], which is brie fly discussed below."
What factors are included in the Kozeny-Carman equation for determining pressure loss through porous materials during laminar flow?," The Kozeny-Carman equation expresses the pressure loss ∆p(N/m2)o fa fl u i d which passes through a porous material, such as a packed bed of solids. This equation, which holds only in case of laminar flow ( Re≤1), can be expressed as follows ∆p L= - 180µ φ2sD2p(1 - ε)2 ε3u= - 180µ φ2sD2p(1 - ε)2 ε3q A where L(m) is the total height of the bed, µ(kg m - 1s - 1)i st h ec o e f fi c i e n to f dynamic viscosity of the fluid, φsis the sphericity (see below) of the particles in the packed bed, Dp(m) is the diameter of the volume equivalent spherical particle, εis the porosity (the fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume) of the bed,µ(m/s) is the mean velocity of the fluid at right angles to the layers of the bed, 720 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures q(m3/s) is the volumetric flow rate of the fluid through the bed, and A(m2)i st h e cross-sectional area of a layer (the cross-sectional area of the solids plus the cross- sectional area of the pores) of the bed."
What does the sphericity of a particle in a packed bed indicate about its shape compared to a sphere?," The minus sign in front of the right-hand side of the preceding equation takes account of the loss of pressure with increasing mean velocity or volumetric flow rate. By sphericity φsof a particle in a packed bed we mean the ratio of the surface area of a sphere having the same volume Vpas the given particle to the surface area Apof the particle, as follows φs=π1 3 ( 6Vp ) 2 3 Ap According to this de finition, the sphericity of a spherical particle is unity, and the sphericity of any non-spherical particle is less than unity."
What experimental equations describe the relationship between pressure loss through a filter and volumetric flow rate?, Ad e r i v a t i o no ft h eK o z e n y - C a r m a ne q u a t i o na n dw o r k e de x a m p l e sf o ri t s application can be found in [ 26]. Other equations (Darcy-Weisbach and Hagen-Poiseuille) found experimentally to determine the loss of pressure through a filter as a function of its volumetric flow rate are discussed in [ 16].
What factors do the equations mentioned above fail to account for when determining filter area needs?," The equations cited above provide an excellent means for evaluating filter area requirements. However, they do not consider pressure losses at entrance and exit [ 1]. Filters are not tested for acceptance with the same fluids as the propellants used by rocket engines, because of dif ficulties due to testing with cryogenic or toxic or corrosive propellants."
What are the six fluids mentioned for use in tests?," Some fluids used for tests are Freon TF, hydraulic oil, trichloroethylene, water, isopropyl alcohol, and methylated ethanol [ 1]. 7.10 Design of a Flange Joint A fl a n g ej o i n to fat y p ef r e q u e n t l yu s e df o rar o c k e te n g i n ei ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g figure, re-drawn from [ 3]."

What is the primary mechanism that seals a raised-face flange joint?," Some flange joints of the raised-face type shown in Sect. 7.4 and also in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 28], have a small gap to eliminate or reduce stresses in the peripheral part of the flange ring. A flange joint of this type is sealed by the bolt force which squeezes the gasket. Seals used for flange joints will be described in Sect."

The bolts used for a flange joint are frequently pre-stressed in tension, in order for a compressive stress to act on the gasket."
What is the relationship expressed by F1 in terms of other forces acting on the circular arc?," This compression seals effectively the joint and avoids leakage. Let us consider an arc of circle of unit length (1 m) passing through the centroid of the flange cross section. According to Huzel and Huang [ 3], the relations between the forces acting on this arc of circle and the minimum loads acting on the bolts can be written as follows F1=F2+F3+F4+F5 F2=pD2 1 4D+We πD F3=p ( D2 2 - D2 1 ) 4D F4=σg ( D2 3 - D2 2 ) 4D σg=mp F5=nF1 Wb=F1πD 7."

What are the three general types of gaskets used for flange connections?," Other types of flange joints have been illustrated in Sect. 7.4.M e t h o d so fc a l c u l a t i o nf o rs u c ht y p e so fj o i n t sa r e described, for example, in [ 28,29]. 7.11 Gaskets and Other Seals for Flange Joints Gaskets are used as static seals. The following types of gaskets are generally used for flange joints: •annular-ring gaskets; •pressure-actuated gaskets; and •full-face gaskets."
What type of gasket is most commonly used for bolted flanges?," Gaskets of the annular-ring type are the most widely used for bolted flanges. Pressure-actuated gaskets use the internal pressure of the fluid as an aid to the sealing action. Full-face gaskets generally require higher bolt loads than is the case with annular-ring gaskets. Full-face gaskets are scarcely tolerant to thermal gradients, and have a tendency to concentrate the loads at the bolt holes and at the portion of the gasket outside the bolt circle."
What types of service conditions are gaskets generally not recommended for regarding temperature and pressure limits?," These gaskets are largely used for non-critical service conditions, but rarely used for service conditions involving either high (above 505 K) or cryogenic (below 122 K) temperatures, or relative pressures above 2.068 MPa [ 2]. Ag a s k e tu s e df o ra fl a n g ej o i n ts h o u l db et h i c ke n o u g ht op r o v i d ea d e q u a t e conformity to the surfaces of the metallic parts of the joint, because thicker gaskets are generally better suited to conform to surface scratches and to compensate for sealing waviness."
"What materials are commonly used for O-rings in gaskets, and what is their temperature range for prolonged use?"," However, the same gasket should be thin enough to provide stability to the joint and to prevent blow-out when residual stresses are low and internal pressures are high [ 2]. Gaskets of a common type have O-rings made of elastomeric materials, which are natural or synthetic rubbers. They are used over a temperature range going from 211 to 505 K for long periods of time, and at higher temperatures for shorter periods of time [ 11]."
What material is used to coat the elastomeric O-ring to maintain ductility at low temperatures?," At low temperatures, the elastomeric O-ring is installed between thin foil films, or is coated with indium, which remains ductile at such temperatures, as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [ 2]. 730 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures The initial seal is obtained by compressing the elastomer to the desired position of installation."
What can result from improper installation of elastomeric O-ring gaskets?," The pressure on the flange ring in service causes the elastomer to conform completely to the flange at the leak path. Elastomeric O-ring gaskets can be used over a wide range of pressures and are high reliable when installed properly. Incorrect installation can cause damage or improper squeeze or extrusion to the elastomer, with consequent leakage."
What is the required percentage range of squeeze to avoid damage and leakage in elastomer applications?, The squeeze required to prevent damage while at the same time preventing leakage due to insuf ficient pressure ranges from 8 to 32%. O-ring extrusion and consequent nibbling of the elastomer occur when the clearance between the retaining members permits the elastomer to be forced into the clearance.
What prevents extrusion in elastomers when appropriate clearances and specific material hardness are utilized?," When the elastomer becomes trapped, it is nibbled or sheared off when the pressure decays. Extrusion can be prevented by combining properly clearances and hard elastomers [ 11]. Elastomeric materials for flanges can also be used in moulded-in-place seals, which are flat plates having elastomeric inserts moulded into machined grooves, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 11]."
What advantage does the design feature of a molded-in-place seal provide over traditional sealing methods regarding flange machining and installation?," In these devices, the initial sealing action is due to the compression of the elas- tomer, and the subsequent sealing action is due to the pressure in service, which forces the elastomer against the flange at the leak path. Am o u l d e d - i n - p l a c es e a lh a st h ef o l l o w i n ga d v a n t a g e so v e rac o n v e n t i o n a lO - r i n g : •the thickness of the metal plate controls the amount of squeeze on the elastomeric portion of the seal, thereby permitting the use of flat-faced flanges on both sides of the seal, and making it unnecessary to machine an O-ring groove in one of the flanges; and •it is easier to install in large and cumbersome hardware, because it can be installed laterally between two flanges."
What types of temperatures can metallic gaskets withstand in flange joints?, 7.11 Gaskets and Other Seals for Flange Joints 731 Moulded-in-place seals have been used successfully in the fuel system of the F-1 rocket engine [ 11]. Metallic gaskets can be used at both cryogenic and high temperatures. These gaskets require high seating loads and are scarcely apt to follow flange de flection.
What advantages do metallic O-rings offer in rocket engine applications where space is constrained?, Metallic O-rings are used in rocket engines particularly where the flanges or the mating surfaces are very rigid and connected with ample bolting [ 11]. Metallic O-ring perform satisfactorily in these conditions and offer the advantage of small cross sections where space is limited. They can be either Te flon®-coated for use at cryogenic temperatures or soft-metal plated for use at high or cryogenic temperatures.
What materials are used as filler in spiral-wound gaskets designed for high-temperature applications?," Spiral-wound gaskets (see Chap. 5, Sect. 5.8)a r em a d eo faV - s h a p e dr i b b o no f stainless steel wrapped spirally with a soft filler of either graphite or Te flon®between the turns, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 11]. These gaskets were used extensively in rocket engines for both cryogenic and high (up to 811 K) temperatures."
What issue arises at the mating flanges when high loads are applied to the edges of the steel ribbon?," They need heavy, rigid flanges and high bolt loads (of the order of magnitude of 5 ×105 - 7×105Np e rm e t r eo fc i r c u m f e r e n c e ) . The high loads at the edges of the steel ribbon caused marring of the mating flanges and reduced the possibility of achieving a good seal when the joint was re-assembled [11]."
What type of seals were initially designed for extremely low temperatures and later adapted for use with high-temperature gases?," Spiral-wound gaskets are still used today where leakage is tolerable, which happens in isolate engine locations and in large diameters, where they have a cost advantage over more sophisticated machined seals. Pressure-actuated seals were originally developed for cryogenic temperatures. Later on, they were modi fied for hot gases."
What is the maximum temperature for hot gases used in the specified rocket engines?," They have been used extensively in the J- 2a n dF - 1r o c k e te n g i n e s .T h e i rr a n g eo fu s ei n c l u d e sc r y o g e n i c fl u i d sa tt e m p e r a t u r e s 732 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures as low as 20 K and pressures as high as 27.56 MPa, and hot gases at temperatures up to 1033 K and pressures up to 10."
What does the cross section of a pressure-actuated seal do when internal fluid pressure is applied?,"34 MPa [ 11]. Pressure-actuated seals are more complex to manufacture and more expensive than those using elastomeric materials, and therefore are used only when those of the latter type cannot meet the requirements. The cross section of a pressure-actuated seal expands due to the internal pressure exerted by the fluid carried in the duct, and this expansion generates the seal."
What type of seal is depicted in the figure that utilizes pressure for actuation and is designed with a cantilever shape?," The de flection of the sealing face is larger than the de flection permissible in an elastomeric material. Therefore, a flange using ap r e s s u r e - a c t u a t e ds e a lc a nb el e s sr i g i da n dh e a v yt h a no n eu s i n ga ne l a s t o m e r i c seal. A pressure-actuated seal of the cantilever (U-shaped) type is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [ 28]."
"What components make up the cross section of the U-shaped seal, and how is sealing action achieved?"," The U-shaped seal sits in a recess of the flange. The cross section of this seal has a web and two legs, each of which has a small tip at its end. The U-shaped seal is supported at the lips and at the outer surface of the web. The internal pressure of the fluid pushes the lips toward the inner surfaces of the flange, thereby exerting the sealing action."
What are the advantages of pressure-actuated seals compared to elastomeric or metallic O-rings?," The dimensions of the cross-section of the seal are usually much smaller than the inside radius of the seal, and the legs of the seal are much more flexible than the web [ 28]. The cross section of a pressure-actuated seal may also be C-shaped (open O-ring) instead of U-shaped. According to [ 28], pressure-actuated seals have the following advantages over elastomeric or metallic O-rings: 7."
What are the benefits of using lightweight flanges in gasket and seal applications?,"11 Gaskets and Other Seals for Flange Joints 733 •high resiliency in seal and low clamping pressures, which result in lightweight flanges; •high localised sealing stress; •external load taken by other components of the connector; •use of available pressure to increase sealing; and •reduction of negative effects of extreme temperatures, due to the ability of the seal to “follow through”."
What types of coatings are used on pressure-actuated seals for ducts that transport cryogenic fluids?, Pressure-actuated seals used for ducts carrying cryogenic fluids are generally coated with Te flon®or with metallic plates. Metallic pressure-actuated seals have been employed in the RS-25 engines of the Space Shuttle. They have been used for cryogenic fluids at temperatures as low as 20 K and pressures up to 62.
What materials are used for metallic seals in high-temperature and high-pressure applications?,"05 MPa, and also for hot gases at temperatures up to 1255 K and pressures up to 42.75 MPa. The metallic seals have been made of Inconel®718 plated with silver or gold to provide a soft sealing material at the interface [ 11]. A groove-type seal, shown in the following figure, adapted from [ 11], is used to save weight and provide a small envelope."
What material typically covers the core of a metallic spring in cryogenic fluid seals?," Plastic spring-loaded seals have been developed for fluids at cryogenic temper- atures. Such seals are made of a jacket of plastic material, usually Te flon®,w h i c h covers a core of metallic spring. The spring provides the force required for the initial seal and also the forces necessary to compensate for dimensional changes resulting from thermal expansions and contractions."
What type of seals are primarily used in rocket engines with storable propellants due to the incompatibility of elastomeric materials?," These seals are pressure-actuated, and therefore the sealing load increases with pressure. Plastic spring-loaded seals are less reliable than metallic pressure-actuated seals at cryogenic temperatures, and are therefore used principally in rocket engines fed with storable propellants, when elastomeric materials are not compatible with such propellants."
What type of load is converted from axial to radial in the seal structure?," 734 7 Interconnecting Components and Structures As e a lo ft h er a d i a lt y p eu s e df o ra fl a n g ei ss h o w ni nt h ef o l l o w i n g fi g u r e ,d u et o the courtesy of NASA [ 11]. In this seal, the axial load acting on the flange is converted to a radial load acting on the interface through a toggle action within the structure of the seal."
What happens to the seal during the installation of the flange joint due to radial interference and axial load?," The two pieces of the flange joint are designed to con fine the outer diameter of the seal, so that radial interference occurs and plastic flow of the seal takes place when an axial load is applied to the joint during installation. The plastic flow makes the seal not re-usable, but the two pieces of the joint are re-usable after installation of new seals."
What is the required axial load per unit length for installing a radial seal in newton per meter of circumference?," The magnitude of the axial load per unit length required to install a radial seal ranges from 87500 to 105000 N per metre of circumference. At y p eo fr a d i a ls e a l ,t h eC o n o s e a l®(described in [ 30]), has been used in some rocket engines (such as the M-1 engine and the Titan engines) and for some rocket vehicles (such as the upper stages S-IV and S-IVB) to seal flange joints for ducts carrying cryogenic propellants, storable propellants, and hot gases [ 11]."

What initiates the reduction of wall thickness in a bellows during its formation?," Bellows are formed by applying hydraulic pressure to tubes of the same diameter dias the bellows diameter at the root of the convolution. The thinning process of the wall of a bellows starts at the original thickness of the material at the root of the convolution, and reduces approximately linearly the thickness to its minimum value at the outside diameter doof the convolution."
What is the range of thinning percentages for the bellows design mentioned?," The amounts of thinning range from 10% to 40% [ 3]. The effects of thinning are taken into account by applying the thinning correction factor to the bellows design. For the bellows design, we use the following equations indicated by Huzel and Huang [ 3]. For steel and nickel alloys, the axial spring constant Ra(N/m) is expressed by Ra=1."
