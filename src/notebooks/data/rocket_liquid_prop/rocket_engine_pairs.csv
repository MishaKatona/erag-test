What principle explains the motion of a rocket based on the action of gas ejection?,"A rocket is a vehicle which moves through space by ejecting a propellant gas at high velocity oppositely to the direction in which the vehicle is desired to move. High-thrust propulsion systems for rocket engines use chemical propellants, which are burned in the combustion chamber of a rocket to generate thrust. According to Newton’s third law of motion (to every action there is always opposed an equal reaction), the continuous ejection of a stream of hot gases in one direction causes a steady motion of the rocket in the opposite direction.. "
What is the role of an oxidiser in a propellant mixture?,"A couple of propellants comprises a fuel and an oxidiser. A fuel is a substance, such as liquid hydrogen (H2) or a mixture of hydrocarbons, which burns in the presence of oxygen to form the hot gases which are accelerated and then ejected at high speed through a nozzle. An oxidiser is either liquid oxygen (Oz) or a substance releasing oxygen, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O>), nitrous oxide (N20), nitronium perchlorate (NO,CI1O,), or another substance, such as fluorine (F), having a strong tendency to accept electrons. The oxidiser combines with the fuel in a proper mixture ratio, as will be shown in Sect. 1.2.. "
What are the four classifications of high-thrust rocket propulsion systems based on the physical states of their propellants?,"Four categories of high-thrust rocket motors may be identified, according to the physical state of the propellants carried within such rockets. These categories are solid-propellant motors, liquid-propellant engines, gaseous-propellant engines and hybrid-propellant engines, the last of them being those which use propellants stored in at least two of the three (solid, liquid, and gaseous) physical states of matter. "
What is the primary mechanism that allows a pump-fed rocket engine to propel itself using liquid bi-propellant?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA-JPL [1], shows a scheme of a pump-fed liquid bi-propellant rocket engine. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license 1 to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines,.

What three key factors influence the thrust magnitude in a rocket engine according to the relationships described?,"A rocket carries a combination of propellants (a fuel and an oxidiser) within itself in order to be capable of operating inside or outside the atmosphere of the Earth. In the rocket engine illustrated above, the magnitude F of the thrust vector F depends on the propellant mass flow rate 7 = dm/dt through the engine, on the magnitude ve of the exit velocity vector v, of the exhaust gas, and on the pressure p, of the gas at the exit plane of the nozzle.. "
What is the primary function of a converging-diverging nozzle in fluid dynamics?,"The principle of functioning of a converging-diverging nozzle (also known as a de Laval nozzle, after the name of its inventor, Gustaf de Laval) is illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA-JPL [1].f De Laval Nozzle © Flow velocity increases from green to red."
What is the condition for flow uniformity and parallelism in the converging and diverging sections of a nozzle?,"As has been shown by Crown [2], a compressible fluid at virtually zero velocity in the combustion chamber is accelerated through the converging portion of the nozzle to sonic speed (M = 1) in the throat where, if the converging portion is properly designed, the flow is uniform and parallel. The fluid is then expanded in the diverging portion of the nozzle until the desired Mach number M > | is reached in the test section, where the flow is again uniform and parallel.. "
What happens to the speed of subsonic flow as the cross-section of a nozzle decreases immediately after a combustion chamber?,"In other words, the cross-section (perpendicular to the gas flow) of the nozzle immediately downstream of the combustion chamber decreases, in order for the subsonic flow (M < 1) to increase its speed up to the speed of sound (M = 1)."
What condition must be met for the flow to attain speeds greater than the speed of sound in a nozzle?,"The sonic flow condition is reached in the throat, where the cross-sectional area A of the nozzle reaches its minimum value A,. In order for the flow to increase further its  speed in supersonic conditions (M > 1), the exhaust gases must expand downstream of the throat, and therefore the cross-sectional area A of the nozzle must increase (A > A,). This is because, in the converging portion of the nozzle, the maximum uniform velocity which can be reached by the flow in any section is the velocity corresponding to the local velocity of sound. "
How does the exit area of a nozzle influence the achievement of optimum thrust in a rocket?,"Further increases in velocity can only be obtained by expanding the gas in the subsequent diverging portion of the nozzle. For optimum performance in terms of thrust, the gas pressure, p-, at the exit plane of the nozzle should be exactly equal to the pressure, po, due to the environment around it. In the vacuum of space (po = 0), this is impossible. The bigger the exit area, A., of the nozzle, the closer the rocket gets to the optimum thrust. "
What is an under-expanded nozzle in relation to rocket motor performance and exhaust gas pressure?,"However, at some point, the additional thrust gained is not worth the added mass which is necessary to make the exit area bigger. In conditions of optimum expansion ratio, the rocket motor produces the maximum thrust. A nozzle, which ends before the exhaust gas reaches the pressure of the outside environment, is called an under- expanded nozzle. In these conditions, the rocket does not get all the thrust available from its engine, because the expansion ratio is too low, and therefore the exhaust gas pressure is greater than the environmental pressure. "
"What term describes a nozzle where the exit area is excessively large, causing the exhaust gas to fully expand prior to exiting?","By contrast, a nozzle, whose cross-sectional area at the exit plane is too large, is called an over-expanded nozzle. This occurs when the expansion ratio A,/A, is too high, and the pressure of the exhaust gas is less than the environmental pressure. Since the cross-sectional area at the exit plane A, is too large, then the exhaust gas completely expands before reaching the exit plane of the nozzle. "
What occurs to gas flow when ambient pressure is lower than the pressure at the nozzle's discharge?,"The gas flow downstream of the exit plane, as a function of the ambient pressure, is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3]. — | This is what happens when the ambient pressure is less than the nozzle flow exit pressure | This is what happens when the ambient pressure is exactly the same as the nozzle flow exit pressure. = —— This is what happens when the ambient pressure is a bit more than the nozzle flow exit pressure. "
What occurs when the ambient pressure significantly exceeds the exit pressure of a nozzle during rocket testing?,"This is | ya what most rockets look like when tested at sea level The dashed lines are oblique shock waves. a This is what happens when the ambient pressure is a ne much more than the nozzle flow exit pressure. Note - —— the flow separated from the wall and the oblique shocks actually inside the nozzle. In the atmosphere, it is difficult to get the optimum expansion ratio, because the air pressure changes with temperature and altitude. "
How can the thrust generated by a spacecraft be calculated based on the mass flow rate and exit velocity of exhaust gas?,"Since a given expansion ratio results in the optimum expansion only at a specific altitude, then the design expansion ratio  of the nozzle must be selected in such a way as to give the best average performance during powered flight. With reference to the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [4], the thrust imparted to the spacecraft by the gas flow can be expressed as follows F=mvy, where m is the mass flow rate of the exhaust gas, and v, is its velocity at the exit plane of the nozzle. "
What is the relationship between thrust and gas exit velocity when mass flow rate remains constant?,"Therefore, for a constant mass flow rate m or weight flow rate W = gom of exhaust gas, the thrust F is proportional to the velocity v,. of the gas at the exit plane. P, — an or a 6 po a a 2 GETET ay Pa =H : F—— - A —> va Z 2 Cope —« Py a a J Ay A spacecraft is subject not only to the thrust due to its engine, but also to the pressure, po, due to the environment around it. At high altitudes, po can be assumed to be equal to zero. "
What is the relationship between net force acting on gas and momentum flux in a thrust chamber according to dynamics principles?,"In these conditions, the net force acting on the gas contained in the thrust chamber (comprising the combustion chamber and the nozzle) is the sum of the reactions coming from the walls and of the reaction of the absolute pressure of gas at the exit plane. These two reaction forces are opposed, as shown in the preceding figure. Therefore, according to the second principle of dynamics, the net force acting on the gas must be equal to the momentum flux out of the thrust chamber, which is 0 J peta — A, Pe = mve Ate where A,, and pj are respectively the area and the pressure of the thrust chamber, A,, Ve, and p, are respectively the area, the gas velocity, and the static absolute pressure of the gas at the exit plane of the nozzle, and mi is the steady mass flow rate of the gas. "
What does the integral on the left-hand side of the equation represent regarding the forces acting on the thrust chamber?,"The integral, that is, the first term on the left-hand side of the preceding equation,  represent the integral of the pressure forces (resultant) acting on the thrust chamber (combustion chamber and nozzle) and projected onto a plane normal to the axis of symmetry of the thrust chamber, as shown in the preceding figure. This integral is just the force, F, which acts on the thrust chamber (and, therefore, on the spacecraft). Consequently, the preceding equation may also be written as follows. "
"Under what conditions is the specified equality applicable regarding injection flow velocity, flow constancy, and chemical equilibrium of combustion products?",This equality holds under the following hypotheses:e the injection flow velocity of the propellants is negligible;¢ the flow is constant and does not change with time during the burn;¢ the products of combustion are in chemical equilibrium after the burn;
What is the flow characteristic of gas molecules as they exit a nozzle in terms of their movement relative to the nozzle's axis?,"e the flow of gas through the exit plane of the nozzle is one-dimensional, that is, all the molecules of the ejected gas move on straight lines which are parallel to the axis of symmetry of the nozzle;"
What characteristics define a flow where density changes significantly and the process is both adiabatic and frictionless?,"e the flow is compressible, that is, the gas density is subject to significant changes;e the flow is isentropic, that is, frictionless and adiabatic (without heat loss), and therefore depends only on the cross-sectional areas of the nozzle; and"
"What equation relates pressure, density, and temperature for a perfect gas, incorporating the gas constant and molar mass?","e the gas flowing in the nozzle is a perfect gas, so that the well-known equation of state p = pRT involving pressure p, density p, and temperature T can be used, where R is the constant of the specific gas (the universal gas constant R* = 8314.460 N m kmol™! K™! divided by the average molar mass M (kg/kmol) of the exhaust gas; for example, if the exhaust gas were water, H2O, then R = 8314.460/18 = 461.9 N mkg™! K~!).. "
"What are the two types of thrust identified in the thrust equation, and how do they relate to gas pressure and kinetic energy?","In the thrust equation written above, the quantity 7i is called the momentum thrust, and the quantity A,p, is called the pressure thrust. The latter term indicates that some (but not all) of the total forces due to the pressure p,- in the thrust chamber contribute to the kinetic energy possessed by the exhaust gases flowing in the nozzle. In other words, a part of the gas pressure generated by the release of chemical energy is used to increase the gas momentum, whereas another part is not. The greater the part of gas pressure used for this purpose, the greater the efficiency of the nozzle.. "
What effect does ambient pressure greater than zero have on the pressure thrust at low altitudes during rocket operation?,"Let us assume now that the rocket is fired at an ambient pressure po greater than zero, that is, at low-altitudes. In these conditions, the pressure forces due to the environment and acting on the outside of the thrust chamber walls have no effect on the gas inside. However, such pressure forces subtract a part (A-po) from the total pressure thrust (A,p,). Since the exhaust gas flows at supersonic velocity through the exit plane of area A,, then the ambient pressure po cannot gain access to it. "
How does ambient pressure influence the overall thrust produced by a propulsion system?,"Therefore, the ambient pressure generates a net unbalanced force onto the projected thrust chamber area, in the direction opposed to the thrust, of magnitude A.po. This fact is taken into account by re-writing the equation of thrust as follows. "
What condition must be met for the effective exhaust velocity to equal the exhaust gas velocity at the nozzle's exit plane?,"F = myve + Ac(Pe — Po)  which is just the equation given in [1]. The same equation may also be written as follows F = my. + A.(Pe — Po) = me where c=v+t Ae(Pe = Po) m is called the effective exhaust velocity, whose value is the same as that of the exhaust gas velocity v, at the exit plane of the nozzle only when the gas pressure p, at the same plane is equal to the ambient pressure po. As has been shown above, the presence of the second addend on the right-hand side of the preceding equation indicates that the optimum value of v, has not been reached.. "
"Calculate the exit gas velocity for a rocket engine with given thrust, mass flow rate, and exit area. What parameters influence the effective exhaust velocities at sea level and in space?","As an application of these concepts to a practical case, taken from [4], it is required to compute the exhaust gas velocity v, at the exit plane of the nozzle, the thrust in space, and the effective exhaust velocities at sea level (c) and in space (cs), for a rocket engine having a thrust F = 4.448 x 10° N at sea level, a mass flow rate mh = 167.5 kg/s due to propellant consumption, an area A, = 0.4905 m? at the exit plane of the nozzle, and an absolute pressure p. = 7.377 x 104 N/m? at the same plane. The atmospheric pressure po at sea level has the standard value 101325 ~ 1.013 x 10° N/m?.. "
How is the thrust derived when considering the difference between two pressure values in a specific calculation?,"In order to compute the value of v., we use the equation of thrust written above solved for v,, as followsF—A.(pe— po) 4.448 x 10° — 0.4905 x (0.7377 — 1.013) x 10°"
What determines whether a rocket engine nozzle is appropriately sized for conditions at sea level?,"Since the pressure p, of the exhaust gas at the exit plane of the nozzle is smaller than the atmospheric pressure po at sea level, then the nozzle of the rocket engine considered in the present example is too long for sea level conditions."
At what point during the rocket's ascent do the atmospheric pressure and exhaust gas pressure at the nozzle exit become equal?,"During the ascent of the rocket, the value of the atmospheric pressure decreases continuously. When the rocket reaches a certain altitude h* above the sea level, the atmospheric pressure at that altitude and the exhaust gas pressure p, at the exit plane of the nozzle have the same value (in the present case, this value is 7.377 x 10+ N/m?), and therefore the value of the component A,(p. — po) of the thrust becomes equal to zero. "
What is the atmospheric pressure threshold at altitude h where it drops below 7.377 x 10^4 N/m²?,"This event represents an ideal expansion of the gas flow. At an altitude h greater than h*, the value of the atmospheric pressure pp becomes less than 7.377 x 104 N/m?, and is equal to zero in space. When this happens, the value of the term A, Po, Which appears on the right-hand side of the equation of thrust, is also equal to zero. The two equations which express the thrust F at sea level and the thrust F in space are respectively  F = ve + Ae(De — Po) Fy = Mitve + Ac Pe By subtracting F from F, and solving for F,, there results F, = F + Apo = 4.448 x 10° + 0.4905 x 1.013 x 10° = 4.945 x 10°N The effective exhaust velocity at sea level results from the preceding equation Ae(Pe — 0.4905 x (0.7377 — 1.013) x 10° ca ye + Beem PO) a 736 4 OA908 OTST = L-ONS) 10"" 5655 mis m 167.5 The effective exhaust velocity in space (where po = 0) is A 0.4905 x 0.7377 x 10° cy ve + APE = 7736 + 24908 * 0-377 IO"" 5959 mis m 167.5 1.2. The Gas Flow Through the Combustion Chamber and the Nozzle. "
"What are the four fundamental equations utilized to determine the exhaust gas velocity at the nozzle's exit, emphasizing conservation principles and the state of gases?","Under the seven hypotheses indicated in Sect. 1.1, itis possible to compute the exhaust gas velocity, v., at the exit plane of the nozzle as a function of the physical properties of the gas. Three of the four fundamental equations used for this purpose express the conservation of energy, mass, and momentum, and the fourth is the equation of state of perfect gases. They are shown below."
"What principle does the energy equation, commonly referred to as the Bernoulli equation, illustrate in fluid dynamics?","The energy equation (also known as the Bernoulli equation) states the principle of conservation of energy. In the hypotheses of Sect. 1.1, let us consider an adiabatic flow between two cross-sections (1 and 2) of a nozzle perpendicular to its axis of symmetry, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5]. "
What is the expression representing the energy dynamics in a non-heat-exchanging flow between two specified sections?,The energy equation for an adiabatic flow between the two cross-sections shown above can be written as follows [6]
What does the term 'enthalpy' account for in a thermodynamic system according to the given information?,"hy —h (7, -1T) =! Evi ~hh=c ~ = 21 1 2 pi 2 7 J where J is the mechanical equivalent of heat (J = 1 because the SI is used in this book, that is, because heat is measured in joules), h = u + p/p is the enthalpy per unit mass of the fluid, u is the internal energy per unit mass of the fluid, c, is the specific heat of the fluid at constant pressure, and T is the temperature of the fluid. The enthalpy measures the total energy of a thermodynamic system, and includes the internal energy of the gas and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its density and its pressure.. "
What does the term c(T1 - T2) represent in terms of energy transformation in gaseous flows?,"The energy equation states that the energy per unit mass available for heat transfer, h, — ho, is converted into kinetic energy per unit mass, Vav3 - vt), of the flow. In other words, an amount of energy in form of heat possessed by the gas is used to increase the velocity of the flow. The term c,(T, — T2) indicates the decrease in temperature resulting from the energy conversion. The specific heat at constant pressure, c,, has been assumed constant, and depends on the composition of the gas resulting from the combustion. "
What conditions apply to velocity and temperature at the exit of a combustion chamber for isentropic flow?,"In particular, when the cross-section | is located at the exit of the combustion chamber (subscript c), as shown in the preceding figure, then there results v; ~ 0, T; = (T.)ns, V2 = v, and T, = T;. Therefore, for an isentropic flow (p/p’ = constant), the energy equation can be written as follows. "
What is the equation for sonic velocity at the inlet involving the specific heat ratio and gas constant?,"Tong = 71+ 2 2 ( ons = fi + “2 i 1 an 2\"" (Pe)ns = (1 + vu?) 1 a Yo ~ (Pe)ns = a(1 + vu?) where M; = vj/a; is the Mach number at the nozzle inlet, y = c,/c, is the specific heat ratio of the gas, R is the specific constant of the gas, and a; = (yRT;)? is the sonic velocity of the flow at the nozzle inlet."
What does the principle of mass conservation imply about the mass flow rate through different cross-sections of a nozzle?,"The second of the four fundamental equations mentioned above states the principle of mass conservation. Since the flow is constant, then the rate 7 at which a quantity of mass m passes through a cross-section A of the nozzle must be independent of the position of this cross-section along the axis of symmetry of the nozzle, that is,"
"What does the equation m = pAv imply about the relationship between gas density, cross-sectional area, and flow velocity along the nozzle?","m = pAv = constant where p, A, and v are respectively the local density of the gas, the local cross-sectional area of the nozzle, and the local velocity of the flow.  Since the mass flow rate through the nozzle must be constant in all sections of the nozzle, the continuity equation may also be written as follows pAv = pA; where the subscript ft indicates the throat of the nozzle, where the Mach number is equal to unity. "
How can the velocity at the exit plane of the nozzle be expressed in terms of energy differences at two specific cross-sections?,"By using the equations written above, it is possible to express the area ratio between any cross-sectional area A, (where M = M,) and the throat cross-sectional area A, (where M, = 1) of the nozzle as follows [2]: 2 yet A 1 2 -1 yt fs) =} (_=_\(14 42-2 A, M?\\y+1 2 Let 1 and 2 be two cross-sections of the nozzle at two arbitrary points along its axis of symmetry. With reference to these sections, the equation of energy can be written as follows hy —hb = Lio > 1 2= 5(2-"") The preceding equation, solved for v2, yields 1 v2 = [20 — hy) + vil? which can also be written as follows [6]: 1 2 7 ; Vv = —Y rn i-(2) +vi y-l Pi By choosing the cross-section 2 as the exit plane of the nozzle (subscript e) and the cross-section | as the exit plane of the combustion chamber (subscript c), the second addend (vj = v2) within curly brackets becomes negligible in comparison with the first. "
What is the relationship between the temperature of the combustion chamber and the stagnation temperature under isentropic conditions?,"Therefore, the velocity of the exhaust gas at the exit plane of the nozzle is expressible as follows 2 reiqy? y y-l Pe This is because the cross-section of the combustion chamber is larger than that of the throat. Therefore, the flow velocity, v., at the exit plane of the combustion chamber can be neglected in the expression given above. In addition, the temperature, T., of the combustion chamber and of the nozzle inlet differs very little, in isentropic conditions, from the stagnation temperature. "
What condition must be met to achieve the maximum theoretical exhaust gas velocity at the exit plane of a nozzle?," The maximum theoretical value of the exhaust gas velocity, v., at the exit plane of the nozzle is reached when the pressure value, p-, at the same plane is zero (infinite expansion). Setting p, = 0 in the preceding equation yields 1 2y 2 (Ve)max =| —— RT. y-1 The third of the fundamental equations mentioned above expresses the principle of conservation of momentum in a steady one-dimensional flow. "
"In a steady, one-dimensional flow of gas, which forces acting on the particle are considered, and which are neglected?","With reference to the following figure, let us consider an infinitesimal particle of gas moving along a streamline, s, in a steady, one-dimensional flow, that is, in a flow whose velocity, v, is independent of time (dv/dt = 0). ds ut We consider here, of all forces which may act on the gaseous particle, only those due to pressure imbalances. Therefore, gravitational, magnetic, and viscous forces are neglected. "
What is the relationship between the change in pressure and the velocity of a gas particle according to the dynamics of motion?,"By applying the second law of dynamics to the motion of the infinitesimal particle of gas along the streamline, the sum of the forces, )°F, in the stream direction, 5s, is equal to the mass, m, of the particle multiplied by the rate of change, dv/dt, of its velocity, that is, dv yor =m = pdA—(p+dp)dA Since the mass, m, of the infinitesimal particle is equal to its density, , times the infinitesimal distance, ds, times the infinitesimal area, dA, then there results m=pdsdA In addition, since the velocity vector of the particle is always tangent to the streamline, then the rate of change of velocity with time is expressible as follows dv dv\ (ds dv —=(—)(—) =v— dt ds} \ dt ds  By substituting the expressions of mass and acceleration in the equation written above, there results dv pdadA —(p+dp)dA = (pdsdA) va S that is, —dp = pvdyv which is the momentum equation. "
What is the relationship between particle velocity and pressure in a streamline flow according to the Euler equation?,"The minus sign in front of dp is due to the fact that the gas particle moves along the streamline, s, from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure; therefore, when the velocity of the particle increases with s, then its pressure decreases. In other words, to each increase in the flow velocity of a particle there corresponds a decrease in its pressure. The preceding equation, also known as the Euler equation, is a particular case of the general Navier-Stokes equations [7]. "
How does a reduction in cross-sectional area affect flow velocity in subsonic conditions according to the principles of flow dynamics?,"Since the flow is not only steady but also isentropic (p/p” = constant), then the following equality holds dp _ dp Says P p The two equations written above, combined together, yield d, d, d dq, p dp}\ p p where 1 dp\? a= dp is the velocity of sound in the flowing gas. Since M = v/a is the Mach number, then by multiplying and dividing the quantity on the left-hand side of the preceding equation by v there results dv d, v— = —a? e v p that is, wee —_ do v p  By combining the preceding equation with the equation (¢Av = constant) which expresses the principle of mass conservation, there results d dA aQ-mj2i= v A For subsonic flow (M < 1), a decrease in the cross-sectional area (dA < 0) of the nozzle causes the flow velocity to increase (dv > 0). "
What is the effect of nozzle cross-sectional area increase on flow velocity in the section downstream of the throat?,"This is what happens in the convergent portion of the nozzle, downstream of the combustion chamber, until the sonic condition (M = 1) is reached in the throat. By contrast, for supersonic flow, an increase in the cross-sectional area (dA > 0) of the nozzle causes the flow velocity to increase (dv > 0). This is what happens in the divergent portion of the nozzle, downstream of the throat. The equations written above (energy, continuity, momentum, and state) make it possible to express the propellant mass flow rate and the thrust in terms of the pressure of the fluid in the combustion chamber (subscript c) and the area of the nozzle throat (subscript t), as will be shown below. "
What is the relationship between mass flow rate per unit area and pressure in the combustion chamber when the Mach number is less than unity?,"The energy equation for the combustion chamber (where v, ~ 0) is o_o Be (1423 “M) p 2 When M ? is much smaller than unity, then the preceding equation yields p © p¢, and consequently 2 2 Pe 1, v pv —=14+-M=14+——-=14+— Pp 2 2RT 2p Hence 1 Po= Pt 3h The mass flow rate per unit area is m —=pv A p Since M = v/a,a = (yRT)?, and T,/T = 1 + Ya(y — 1)M?, then z RT. v= | | 1+45-M and therefore  , aaa ty = Bev? 1 ™ — = pv = —— | ——_ A (RT.)? | 1+ 44M? The preceding equation, written for the throat (where A = A, and M = 1), yields 1 ytl m pe? | 2 | 27-0 Ar (RT,)2LyY +1 that is, A = (yy (RT)? where yt 1 2 27-0 ry=y3 (=) y Y y+1 is the Vandenkerkhove function. "
How does thrust relate to the area of the nozzle throat and the pressure in the combustion chamber when pressure thrust equals zero?,"By introducing the expressions of m,, and v, derived above in the equation of thrust F=my, + A.(Pe— Po) it is possible to re-write this equation as follows [8]: dy? . \e riqy3 yt 2 \ 7 F=Arpe (=) 1- (“) + Ac(De — Po) y—-l\yF+1 Pe which expresses the thrust in terms of the pressure of the fluid in the combustion chamber and of the area of the nozzle throat. In other words, when the pressure thrust is zero, which occurs when p, = po, then the thrust is directly proportional to the throat area, A,, and nearly directly proportional to the pressure, p,, of the fluid within the combustion chamber.. "
What is produced when hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a combustion process?,"The chemical reaction, which takes place in the combustion chamber when the fuel combines with the oxidiser, is an oxidation. When the fuel is hydrogen (H2) and the oxidiser is oxygen (O2), the product of the combustion is water (H2O) in its gaseous state, due to of the high temperature generated when hydrogen burns in the presence of oxygen, according to the well-known reaction"
What is the amount of hydrogen produced per second in kilomoles?,"This means that, in each second, two kilomoles of hydrogen (that is, 2 x 2 x 1"
What is the stoichiometric mixture ratio of the oxidizer to the fuel for the given reaction?,"= 4 kg of hydrogen) react with one kilomole of oxygen (that is, 2 x 16 = 32 kg of  oxygen) to form two kilomoles of water (that is, 2 x (2 + 16) = 36 kg of water). The corresponding stoichiometric mixture ratio (0/f}) of the oxidiser (0) to the fuel (f) is 2 _ mo _ 32 f omy 4"
What is the maximum temperature at which hydrogen can remain in liquid form at atmospheric pressure?,"In other words, 8 kg of oxygen are necessary to burn | kg of hydrogen in 1 s. When used for rockets, hydrogen and oxygen are most often stored in their liquid state of aggregation, at very low temperatures (cryogenic propellants). This is because they take less space in the liquid state than in the gaseous state at normal temperature and pressure conditions. Hydrogen remains liquid without evaporating at atmospheric pressure (101325 N/m?) at a temperature not higher than 20 K, and oxygen does the same at a temperature not higher than 90 K [9].. "
What is the maximum allowable temperature for storing liquid methane used in cryogenic fuel for space propulsion?,"Another cryogenic fuel used for space propulsion is liquid methane (CH), which requires a storage at a temperature not higher than 111 K [10]. The related chemical reaction with liquid oxygen is [10]:"
What is the stoichiometric mixture ratio of oxidiser to fuel for the given reaction involving methane and oxygen?,"In each second, one kilomole of methane (that is, 12 + 4 x 1 = 16 kg of methane) reacts with two kilomoles of oxygen (that is, 2 x 2 x 16 = 64 kg of oxygen) to form one kilomole of carbon dioxide (that is, 12 + 2 x 16 = 44 kg of carbon dioxide) and two kilomoles of water (that is, 2 x (2+ 16) = 36 kg of water). The corresponding stoichiometric mixture ratio (o/f) between the oxidiser (0) and the fuel (f) is. "
What is the maximum allowable storage temperature for liquid fluorine to maintain its stability as a cryogenic oxidiser?,"A cryogenic oxidiser which can be used either alone or in combination with liquid oxygen is liquid fluorine (F2), which requires a storage at a temperature not higher than 85 K. Fluorine is extremely toxic and reacts violently with most substances [10]. Cryogenic propellants are difficult to store over long periods of time, due to the low temperatures required by them. Therefore, they are not used in military rockets, which must be taken in a state of readiness for launch over times of several months. "
What is the relationship between the performance of cryogenic propellants and the storage volume required for liquid hydrogen compared to other fuels?,"In addition, liquid hydrogen requires a storage volume many times greater than that required by other fuels, because of its very low density (70.85 kg/m). On the other hand, the higher performance made available by cryogenic propellants makes them particularly attractive when constraints of storage and reaction time are not critical. For example, according to Aerojet Rocketdyne [11], the RS-25 engines aboard the Space Shuttle orbiter use liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and have a specific impulse in space (see Sect. "
What is the specific impulse in space for the RL10 engines used on the Centaur rocket?,"1.3) of 451 s. The RL10 engines on the Centaur, the US first liquid-hydrogen/liquid-oxygen rocket stage, have a specific impulse in space of 433 s [12]. The J-2 engines used on the Saturn V second and third stages and on the second stage of the Saturn 1B also burn the liquid-hydrogen/liquid-oxygen combination. They have a specific impulse in space of 424 s [13]. By comparison,  the liquid-oxygen/kerosene combination used in the cluster of five F-1 engines in the Saturn V first stage has a specific impulse in space of 304 s [14]. Ina few words, liquid hydrogen, in comparison with other fuels (such as kerosene), yields more power per unit volume of storage.. "
What is the general representation of the oxidation reaction when the fuel utilized is a hydrocarbon?,"When the fuel is a hydrocarbon (for example, kerosene), the oxidation reaction may be represented [10] as follows"
What is the stoichiometric mixture ratio of oxidiser to fuel for the given reaction involving dodecane and oxygen?,"In each second, two kilomoles of dodecane (that is, 2 x 12 x 12+ 2 x 26= 340 kg of dodecane) react with twenty-five kilomoles of oxygen (that is, 25 x 2 x 16 = 800 kg of oxygen) to form twenty-four kilomoles of carbon monoxide (that is, 24 x (12 + 16) = 672 kg of carbon monoxide) and twenty-six kilomoles of water (that is, 26 x (2 + 16) = 468 kg of water). The corresponding stoichiometric mixture ratio (o/f) between the oxidiser (0) and the fuel (f) is. "
What range of carbon atoms is typically found in the hydrocarbons that make up kerosene?,"It is to be noted that kerosene is a mixture of hydrocarbons. The chemical compo- sition of kerosene depends on its source. It usually consists of about ten different hydrocarbons, each of them containing from 10 to 16 carbon atoms per molecule; the constituents include n-dodecane, alkyl benzenes, and naphthalene and its derivatives. Kerosene is usually represented by the single compound n-dodecane. "
What is the military specification that highly-refined kerosene used in rocket engines must conform to?,"In particular, RP-1 is a special type of highly-refined kerosene which conforms to Military Spec- ification MIL-R-25576 and is used as a fuel for rocket engines [10]. For example, RP-1 is used in the first-stage boosters of the Delta and Atlas-Centaur rockets. It also powered the first stages of the Saturn 1B and Saturn V [10]. Hydrocarbon-based fuels do not pose the severe constraints of storage which are peculiar to cryogenic fuels. "
What type of fuels demonstrate a higher specific impulse compared to others mentioned?,"On the other hand, as has been shown above, the specific impulse yielded by them is considerably less than that made available by cryogenic fuels.. "
What are the characteristics of hypergolic propellants that make them suitable for orbital maneuvering systems?,"Another class of substances used for space propulsion includes the hypergolic propellants, that is, specific couples of fuels and oxidisers which ignite sponta- neously and violently when one gets in touch with the other, without the need for any ignition source. Such propellants remain liquid at normal temperatures. These prop- erties make them particularly suitable for propulsion and hydraulic power systems carried aboard spacecraft, and in particular for those which are meant to be used for orbital manoeuvring. "
"What are the primary components commonly used in hypergolic propellants, particularly focusing on types of hydrazine?","On the other hand, hypergolic propellants are extremely toxic and/or corrosive and must be handled with the highest care. The most common fuels used in hypergolic propellants are hydrazine (N2H4), monomethy! hydrazine (CH3(NH)NHz2), unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H2NN(CH3)2), and Aerozine 50, the last being an equal mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine.. "
What are the primary oxidisers commonly paired with the mentioned fuels in propulsion systems?,"According to Nufer [15], the oxidisers used in combination with the fuels named above are usually nitrogen tetroxide (N2Ox) and various blends of nitrogen tetroxide  with nitric oxide (NO). Hypergolic propellants are used in the core liquid-propellant stages of the Titan family of launch vehicles, and on the Delta launcher. The Space Shuttle orbiter uses hypergolic propellants in its orbital manoeuvring subsystem for orbital insertion, main orbital manoeuvres, and de-orbit. "
What specific impulse efficiency range is achieved by the reaction control system utilizing certain propellants in the Space Shuttle?,"It also uses hypergols in its reaction control system for attitude control [10]. The efficiency (in terms of specific impulse) reached in the Space Shuttle by combining monomethyl hydrazine with nitrogen tetroxide ranges from 260 to 280 s in the reaction control system, and to 313 s in the orbital manoeuvring subsystem, the higher efficiency of the latter being attributed by NASA [10] to higher expansion ratios in the nozzles and higher pressures in the combustion chambers.. "
What are the advantages of using a liquid-propellant engine compared to a solid-propellant motor regarding propellant flow control?,"In a liquid-propellant rocket, the fuel and the oxidiser are stored in two separate containers, and are sent to the combustion chamber by means of two separate systems of pipes, valves, and pumps. As the sequel will show, a liquid-propellant engine is more complex than a solid-propellant motor, but has several advantages over the latter. This is because the former offers the possibility of controlling the flow of propellant towards the combustion chamber, thereby permitting of throttling, stopping, or re- starting the engine.. "
What happens to the velocity of gas in the combustion chamber as the density decreases towards the nozzle inlet?,"The liquid propellants are introduced into the combustion chamber at the injecting plane with a small axial velocity, vj,;, which is assumed to be equal to zero in the present calculation. The combustion proceeds throughout the length of the combus- tion chamber, and is presumed to be complete at the inlet plane of the nozzle. The density of the gas decreases from one section of the combustion chamber to the other, due to the heat of combustion released between these sections. Since the mass flow rate remains constant, the gas accelerates toward the inlet section of the nozzle, and its pressure decreases.. "
What factors contribute to the energy loss during the expansion process in a combustion chamber?,"In practice, the gas flow within the combustion chamber is not entirely isentropic, that is, the expansion process within the combustion chamber is neither fully irre- versible nor fully adiabatic. The stagnation temperature, T,, remains nearly constant, but the stagnation pressure, p,, decreases. This causes an energy loss, which depends on the specific heat ratio, y, of the gas, and also on the nozzle contraction area ratio, A,/A,, where A, is the area of the cross-section of the combustion chamber, and A; is the area of the cross-section of the throat. "
How does the acceleration of gas flow in a nozzle influence the efficiency of a thermal process?,"The energy loss occurs where the accel- eration of gases is affected by expansion due to heat release, as is the case in the combustion chamber, rather than by a change of area, as is the case in the nozzle. The greater the acceleration of the gas flow given by the nozzle, the more efficient the process is.. "
How is the total pressure ratio expressed in terms of the total pressure at the combustion chamber inlet and the Mach number at that plane?,"The following figure, adapted from [16], shows the static pressure p, the temper- ature T, and the velocity v of a gas flowing from the inlet plane to the exit plane of a converging-diverging nozzle.  M=1 J | Vv T ! | | / | p | M<1 M>1 i l i +I ow Sie cla w r vo c t= 6 ee a ; a. a F x Vv x< iS aq ww i i Neglecting the velocity of the gas flow at the injecting plane (vj,; = 0) and assuming the total pressure of the combustion chamber at the injecting plane (p_.)jnj to be equal to the pressure of the injector pjn; (that is, assuming (p-)inj = Pinj), the total pressure ratio (Pe)inj/(Pc)ns can be expressed as follows [4]: (Pe)ing — 1+ MP (Pens (eae) ma where (p,.),5 1s the total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet, M; is the Mach number at the nozzle inlet plane, and y = c,/c, is the specific heat ratio of the gas. "
What is the simplified relationship for the static pressure ratio when comparing the inlet plane and the throat plane in a nozzle?,"The preceding equation results from the equation of energy written for the converging portion of nozzle, which goes from the inlet plane (where the Mach number of the gas flow is M;) to the throat plane (where the Mach number of the gas flow is M; = 1). In case of the static pressure ratio pjyj/p;, the preceding equation can be simplified as follows  Pini = + yM? Pi. "
What is the typical value indicated for M; when the contraction area ratio is 2 and the specific heat ratio is 1.2?,"In order to reduce the energy loss mentioned above, a small value (that is, consid- erably smaller than unity) is desirable for M;. A typical value of 0.31 is indicated by Huzel and Huang [4] for a thrust chamber having a contraction area ratio, A;/A;, equal to 2 and a gas having a specific heat ratio, y, equal to 1.2."
"What type of nozzle is used in rocket engines, characterized by a decreasing cross-section with a minimum area at a specific point?","In this manner, a combustion chamber performs efficiently its function of converting a propellant into a gas of high temperature and pressure through combus- tion. This gas is then accelerated within the nozzle, as will be shown below. The nozzles used in rocket engines are of the converging-diverging (de Laval) type, as has been shown in Sect. 1.1. In a nozzle of this type, the area of the cross-section decreases and reaches its minimum value at the throat. "
What happens to gas velocity after it passes the throat and enters the diverging section of a nozzle?,"Downstream of the throat, this area increases to the exit plane of the nozzle. The velocity of the gas flow increases, reaches the sonic value at the throat, and then increases further to supersonic values in the diverging portion of the nozzle.. "
What parameter is the critical pressure ratio in gas flow dependent upon in isentropic expansion conditions?,"As has been shown in Sect. 1.1, the gas flow through the nozzle is assumed to be an isentropic expansion. The total temperature and the total pressure of the gas are also assumed to remain constant throughout the nozzle. In these conditions, the pressure ratio, P;/(P-)ns, between the static pressure at the throat and the total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet is the critical pressure ratio, which depends only on the specific heat ratio, y, as follows. "
How does the sonic velocity of a gas flow in a nozzle throat behave regardless of the ambient pressure at the exit?,"Pr 2 wa (Pons (; + i) which results from the energy equation. The sonic velocity (M, = 1) of the gas flow is reached in the throat independently of whether the value of the ambient pressure (po) at the exit plane of the nozzle be, or be not, less than the value of the gas pressure at the throat."
What occurs to the pressure of gas in the diverging section of a nozzle during an ideal expansion?,"In case of an ideal expansion (po = p-), the pressure of the gas flowing in the diverging portion of the nozzle continues to decrease, as shown in the preceding figure. Otherwise, an increase in pressure occurs in the diverging portion of the nozzle. This increase in pressure may take place either by isentropic subsonic deceleration of the gas flow, or by non-isentropic discontinuities (called shock waves), or by a combination of both of these manners.. "
"What phenomenon occurs in a gas flow that is exemplified by shock waves, as illustrated in visual material provided by NASA?","An example of shock waves in a gas flow is shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [17].  bs —— 1 J"
What phenomenon causes the formation of visible patterns of blue cones in the exhaust plume of high-speed engines?,"The blue cones of light, which appear below the three main engines of the Space Shuttle, are known as shock (or Mach) diamonds. They are due to the formation of shock waves in the exhaust plume of the three main engines. The exhaust gas (H20) flowing from the engines reaches the speed of Mach 10, and the increase in pressure results in the shock diamonds."
What occurs to gas velocity and pressure in the diverging section of a nozzle when the flow achieves supersonic speeds?,"Lower values of pressure than that of the ambient pressure (pp) can be reached in the diverging portion of a nozzle, where the exhaust gas flows at supersonic speed. The higher ambient pressure cannot advance upstream of the nozzle, because the gas flows at supersonic speed. However, along the nozzle walls, due to the friction, there may be a boundary layer of gas moving at low speeds. Within this boundary layer, the gas moves at subsonic speeds, and therefore the ambient pressure can advance upstream for a distance. Therefore, the low-pressure central flow is forced away from the nozzle walls.. "
What is the molar mass of the combustion products in the described rocket engine?,"The following example shows a calculation relating to an ideal liquid-propellant rocket engine. The following data are known (from [4]): propellant mass flow rate in the combustion chamber 7in,, = 163.6 kg/s, total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet (pons = pill + %(y — 1)M?]""”-! = 6.895 x 10° N/m’, total temperature of the combustion chamber (T.)ns = Till + ¥a(v — 1)M?] = 3633 K (7; and M; being respectively the flow temperature and the Mach number at the nozzle inlet), molar mass of the combustion products M = 22.67 kg/kmol, specific heat ratio of the combusted gas y = 1.20, and expansion area ratio of the nozzle A,/A; = 12. "
What is the static pressure at the injection plane given the total pressure calculated from the total pressure ratio and the specified variables?,"The Mach number M;,, at the injection plane is assumed to be equal to zero, and the Mach number MM; at the inlet plane of the nozzle is assumed to be equal to 0.4. In practice, the design values used for M; range from 0.15 to 0.45. We want to compute the static pressures pjnj, P;, Px (at. a cross-section x of area A, = 4A,), and p, of the gas. As has been shown above, the total pressure ratio (p¢)inj/(Pe)ns can be expressed by means of the following equation  (Pe)inj _ 1+ yM? In the present case, there results inj 141.20 x 0.47 Poinj _ = 1.084 (Pens (1 H2Q=1 x 0.42) 7 Since (pe)ns = 6.895 x 10° N/m, then the total pressure at the injection plane is (Pe)inj = 6.895 x 10° x 1.084 = 7.474 x 10°N/m? Since Mj; has been assumed to be equal to zero, then the static pressure at the injecting plane is Pinj = (Pedinj = 7.474 x 10°N/m? At the inlet plane of the nozzle, the Mach number is assumed to be M; = 0.4. "
What is the expression for the static pressure ratio at the inlet plane of a nozzle?,"Since the static pressure ratio pjnj/p; is expressed by the preceding equation Ping yy yM? Pi then the static pressure at the inlet plane of the nozzle is inj 7.474 x 10° pi = Pit 6.270 x 10°Nv? 1+yM; 1+ 1.20 x 0.4 The static pressure of the gas at the throat results from the preceding equation (Pe)ns y+ In the present case, since (p_)ns = 6.895 x 10° N/m? and y = 1.20, then 12 6.895 x 10° 2 VP 3.809 x 10°N/m? Pr = 6. "
Calculate the static pressure at a specified cross-section with an area given as four times another area according to the provided relationship.,"x x 241 = 3. x m’ The static pressure p, at the cross-section x of area A, = 4A, results from the following equation given in [4]:  a 1 2 \T( Wdns \% a (Ar) (Se) A, r14)4 vel] yp ( Bs ) z | y-l | (Pens. "
What method employs quadratic interpolation and requires three points to locate an unknown root value?,"The unknown value of p, can be computed numerically, as will be shown below. For convenience, we set z = p,/(p.)ns, Where z is an auxiliary variable.Miiller’s method of root finding uses a quadratic interpolation and consequently requires the knowledge of three points in the vicinity of the unknown value of the root z to be found. This method is briefly described below."
What indicates the existence of a real root in the function f(z) = 0 between the endpoints zz and z?,"Let zz and z, be the endpoints of an interval z2 < z < z; containing the unknown value, z, of the root of a given equation. Let f(z) be the function which is required to be equal to zero in the point z. The existence of at least one real root of f(z) = 0 lying between zz and z, is assured if fy = f(z2) and f; = f(z) have opposite signs. Following Gerald and Wheatley [18], the computation is performed as follows:. "

What is the method for determining the maximum absolute value of a variable based on its sign?,"the maximum absolute value (that is, if B > 0, choose plus; if B < 0, choose minus;"
How should the values of z be adjusted for the next iteration based on the comparison of the computed z and another value?,"e check the computed value of z to determine which set of three points should be used in the next iteration (if z is greater than zo, take zo, z;, and the root z for the next iteration; if z is less than Zo, take Zo, z2, and the root z for the next iteration); and  e reset the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 so that zp should be placed between z2 and z;, and repeat the cycle while the computed value of z does not satisfy the condition f(z) = 0 to some acceptable degree of tolerance. "
What is the interval in which the function changes sign for the unknown pressure ratio?,"In the present case (A,/A; = 4 and y = 1.2), we define a function f(z) such that ya ge AH Zz f (2) (38-2) 12-1 Since p, = 3.892 x 10° N/m? and (p¢)ns = 6.895 x 10° N/m?, then the unknown value of the pressure ratio z = p/(pe)ns is less than p,/(pe)ns = 0.5645.

By using this definition of c, the specific impulse relating to the thrust chamber can be determined as follows  * (je = &0"
"What are the two performance indicators crucial for rocket vehicle design, as opposed to those important for rocket engine design?","Of the performance indicators defined above, the specific impulse (/,) and the propellant mass fraction (R,) are of great importance to the designer of a rocket vehicle as a whole. On the other hand, the characteristic velocity (c*) and the thrust coefficient (Cf) are of great importance to the designer of a rocket engine, as will be shown below."
What is the significance of characteristic velocity in assessing rocket engine performance?,"The characteristic velocity (c*) of a rocket engine, in which the sonic velocity of the gas flow is reached at the throat, measures the energy possessed by the propellant and the quality level characterising the injector and the combustion chamber. It may be expressed by the following equation [4]:"

What factors influence the total temperature of the combustion chamber at the inlet of the nozzle?,"This equation indicates the mass or the weight flow rate of propellant which must be burned to maintain the required total pressure (p-)ns at the nozzle inlet. A smaller value of propellant consumption 7;- or W,- corresponds to a higher value of c*. Another expression of the characteristic velocity c* is given in [4] as follows 1 «_ LYRTns]?

K~! divided by the average molar mass M of the combusted gas). "
What factors influence the characteristic velocity of a combusted gas at the nozzle inlet?,"The preceding equation shows that the characteristic velocity c* depends on the properties of the combusted gas at the nozzle inlet, such properties being the specific heat ratio y, the constant R of the specific gas, and the total temperature of the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet (Te)ns-. "
How can the thrust coefficient be represented in relation to exhaust gas expansion and nozzle design parameters?,The thrust coefficient Cr depends on the expansion of the exhaust gas and also onthe design of the nozzle.

What is the relationship between actual thrust and the theoretical force assuming no expansion occurs in exhaust gases?,"The thrust coefficient, put in this form, is the ratio of the actual thrust F acting on the rocket to the force A; (p¢),s; Which would act on the rocket if there were no expansion of the exhaust gas downstream of the throat, that is, if the total pressure on the combustion chamber acted only on the area of the throat."
What mathematical expression represents the theoretical thrust coefficient as a function of altitude?,"The following equation, given in [4], expresses the theoretical value of the thrust coefficient at any altitude:"

"
How does an increase in ambient pressure affect the thrust produced by a rocket engine?,"As has been shown in Sect. 1.1, when the ambient pressure increases from zero (in space) to po > 0, then the thrust generated by a rocket engine decreases from F’,, (in space) to F by an amount A,po. Such is also the case with the thrust coefficient of a rocket engine, which decreases from (Cr), (in space) to Cr by an amount (A,/A;) po/(Pe)ns, aS Shown by the preceding equation. The same equation may also be rewritten as follows Ae] Po Cr = (Cr)s — =~ [a ‘ At (Pens. "
What relationship exists between thrust values and ambient pressure levels?,"In other words, higher values of thrust F and thrust coefficient Cr correspond to lower values of ambient pressure po."
What occurs to the thrust of a rocket engine when the pressure of exhaust gas at the nozzle exit plane falls below the ambient pressure?,"For a given value po of ambient pressure, the optimum value of thrust is reached when the expansion area ratio A,/A, of the nozzle is such that p, = po. Let us consider a region in the divergent portion of a nozzle where p, > po. In this region, the thrust of a rocket engine increases, and reaches its maximum value at the plane where p, = Po. When the divergent portion of a nozzle extends downstream of this plane, then  the pressure p, of the exhaust gas at the exit plane becomes less than the ambient pressure po, causing a decrease in the value of thrust. "
What term describes the ratio of expansion areas in a nozzle when the upstream pressure equals the ambient pressure?,"The value of the expansion area ratio A,/A, of the nozzle corresponding to the condition p, = po is called the optimum expansion area ratio.. "
What is the maximum expansion area ratio recommended for rockets operating in space to avoid excessive weight?,"Since the value of the ambient pressure decreases with altitude, no value of A,/A; is optimum at all altitudes, and therefore the design value of A,/A; is to be found on the basis of a compromise. This compromise is not necessary in case of upper stages of rockets, which operate at ambient pressures of zero or near zero. In case of rockets operating in space (po = 0), a value of expansion area ratio greater than 25 has been found to be scarcely useful [4]. Therefore, in order to reduce weight, this value is not exceeded.. "
What does a small specific heat ratio indicate about the energy storage capacity in exhaust gases and its effect on rocket engine performance?,"The specific heat ratio y = c,/c, is an indicator of the quantity of energy stored in the molecules of exhaust gas. In particular, a small value of y indicates a high capacity of storing energy, which results in a high performance of a rocket engine. The equations given above, which express c* and Cr as functions of y, indicate high values of c* and Cr for low values of y. These equations are re-written below for convenience of the reader.. "

How does the specific exhaust gas constant influence the characteristic velocity in a rocket engine according to its relationship with R?,"The effect of the constant R = R*/M of the specific exhaust gas on the perfor- mance of a rocket engine is shown by the first of the two preceding equations, which expresses the characteristic velocity c* as a function of R. Since c* is proportional to the square root of R, then the value of c* increases for increasing values of R."
What relationship exists between the thrust coefficient and the total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet?,"The effect of the total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet, (Pe)ns, is Shown by the second of two equations written above, which expresses the thrust coefficient Cr as a function of (p¢)ns. It is to be noted that the total pressure (Pens appears above in the two pressure ratios pe/(Pe)ns and Po/(Pe)ns-"

How does an increase in total pressure at the nozzle inlet affect thrust in a combustion chamber?,"shows that, for a given area of the cross-section of the nozzle at the throat A,, the thrust F is proportional to both the total pressure in the combustion chamber at the nozzle inlet (p¢),s and the thrust coefficient Cr. Therefore, when the total pressure (p-)ns increases in a given combustion chamber, then the thrust F also increases. Increasing values of (p-)ns also cause the values of the total temperature in the combustion chamber (T.),s to increase, and the values of y and R to decrease. "
What happens to the effects when the total pressure surpasses a specific threshold value in the context provided?,"According to Huzel and Huang [4], these effects are slight, especially when the value of the total pressure (p.)ns is greater than 2.068 x 10° N/m?.. "
What are some factors that differentiate an ideal rocket engine from a real rocket engine?,"The performance indicators considered so far refer to an ideal rocket engine, which differs from a real rocket engine for the following reasons. A real engine is subject to friction, heat transfer, effects due to non-perfect gases, misalignment of the gas flow with respect to the axis of symmetry of the nozzle, non-uniform reacting substances and flow distribution, and changes in the composition of the exhaust gas. "
What factors contribute to variations in gas composition along the centerline of a nozzle?,"A change in gas composition, in turn, is due to non-uniform values of the quantities y, M, and R along the axis of symmetry of the nozzle.. "
How can actual values of thrust and thrust coefficient be calculated using theoretical values and a specific correction factor?,"The actual quantities result from multiplying the corresponding theoretical quantities by correction factors.In particular, the correction factor n-, whose values range from 0.92 to 1.00 [4], makes it possible to compute the actual values of thrust (F) and thrust coefficient (Cr) from the corresponding theoretical values (F and Cr), as follows"

"
What are the four categories used to classify liquid propellants in aerospace applications?,1.1 and 1.2. The present paragraph deals specifically with liquid propellants. They may be classified into the following categories: e mono-propellants; e bi-propellants; © cryogenic propellants; and e storable propellants.. 
"What type of substance decomposes into hot gas to produce thrust, often in the presence of a catalyst?","A mono-propellant is either a mixture of a fuel with an oxidiser, or a single substance which decomposes into a hot gas in a thrust chamber, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst. This chemical decomposition releases thermal energy, which is contained within the chemical bonds of the molecules involved in the reaction. For example, hydrogen peroxide (H,O02) decomposes into hot water vapour (H,O) and gaseous oxygen (O2) when made to pass through a platinum catalyst mesh, according to the following reaction:. "
What are the gaseous products formed when nitrous oxide is heated or treated with a catalyst?,"2H202 — 2H20 + O  The gases resulting from this reaction are ejected through a nozzle to generate thrust. A gaseous mono-propellant, which can be used instead of hydrogen peroxide, is nitrous oxide (NO). This substance, when heated or passed over a catalyst bed, decomposes exothermically into gaseous nitrogen (Nz) and gaseous oxygen (Oz), according to the following reaction: 2N20 — 2N) + Op?"
What type of oxidizer is used in the described propulsion system?,"A scheme, which illustrates a rocket engine fed by nitrous oxide, is shown in the following figure, (re-drawn from [20]). Further information on this type of mono- propellant can be found, for example, in [20]."
What component is associated with the pressurised fluid in a nozzle tank and serves as a catalyst for the main injector?,7 Main Injector Catalyst Nozzle Tank containing the valve bed pressurised fluid
What is the primary substance that decomposes in a mono-propellant engine to yield gaseous nitrogen and hydrogen?,"The most widely used mono-propellant is hydrazine (anhydrous N>Hy, also written HyNNHz), which is a strong reducer, that is, a substance which donates elec- trons to another substance in a redox chemical reaction. In a mono-propellant engine, hydrazine decomposes (in the presence of a catalyst such as iridium metal supported by high-surface-area alumina, or carbon nanofibres, or molybdenum nitride on alumina) into gaseous nitrogen (Nz) and gaseous hydrogen (Hz), or into ammonia (NHs3) and gaseous nitrogen (N2), according to the following exothermic reactions [21]:. "
What type of propellant system utilizes hydrazine and operates under high pressure for rocket propulsion?,"A scheme illustrating a mono-propellant rocket engine fed by hydrazine is shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [22].  high-pressure gas monopropellanttank Pressure-Fed Monopropellant Rocket System expansion chamber and nozzle"
How does an electric solenoid valve function in the operation of a propellant engine utilizing hydrazine?,"With reference to the preceding figure, the working principle of a hydrazine mono- propellant engine can be described as follows. An electric solenoid valve, placed between the hydrazine tank and the thrust chamber, opens in order to allow liquid hydrazine, in a pulsed or continuous flow, to reach the injector. This hydrazine enters the thrust chamber as a spray and gets in touch with the catalyst bed. "
What is the purpose of the iridium-impregnated alumina pellets in the catalyst bed during the dissociation of hydrazine?,"This bed consists of alumina (Al,O3) pellets impregnated with iridium. The catalyst bed and the hot gases leaving the catalyst particles cause the liquid hydrazine to vaporise, and its temperature to rise to a point where the chemical reaction of dissociation is self-sustaining. Then, the gases resulting from hydrazine decomposition leave the catalyst bed and exit from the chamber through a nozzle of high expansion ratio to produce thrust.. "
What is the approximate specific impulse range for mono-propellant hydrazine engines?,"Mono-propellant hydrazine engines produce a specific impulse of about 230- 240 s. Mono-propellant engines using hydrogen peroxide and nitrous oxide have a lower performance than that obtained with hydrazine, since their specific impulses are respectively about 150 and 170 s [10]."
What is a common characteristic of green propellants compared to hydrazine in terms of safety and environmental impact?,"Since hydrazine is corrosive, highly toxic and carcinogenic, and is also dangerous to handle and store, then new substances, called green propellants, are being studied and tested for its replacement. A green propellant is an aqueous solution of a high- energy oxidiser (such as hydroxyl ammonium nitrate, ammonium dinitramide, and others) and a fuel (such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and others). "
What is the chemical formula for hydroxyl ammonium nitrate?,"Hydroxyl ammo- nium nitrate, also known as HAN, whose chemical formula is NH3OHNO;, is a salt derived from hydroxyl amine (NH2OH) and nitric acid (HNO3), which can be used as a solution in mono-propellants, or also as a solid oxidiser in bi-propellants. The Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA, has developed a hydroxyl ammonium nitrate-based propellant known as AF-M315E. "
"What is the specific impulse value of the propellant mentioned, and how does it compare to the specific impulse of hydrazine?","This propellant is less toxic and easier to handle than hydrazine, and has a specific  impulse J; = 257 s, which is about 12% greater than the specific impulse of hydrazine, the latter being 7, = 230 s. It requires a catalyst bed preheating at a temperature exceeding 558 K to be ready for general operation [23].. "
What are the gaseous products formed when ammonium dinitramide is subjected to heat?,"Ammonium dinitramide, also known as ADN, whose chemical formula is NH,4N(NO>})o, is the ammonium (NH4*) salt of the dinitraminic acid (HN(NO2)2), and was invented in the 1970s in the former Soviet Union and independently invented again in 1989 in the United States by SRI International. Gaseous ammonium dinitramide decomposes under heat into ammonia (NH3;), nitrous oxide (NO), and nitric acid (HNO3), according to the following two-branch reaction [24]:. "
What liquid mono-propellant produced by EURENCO Bofors comprises 65% ammonium dinitramide and a mixture of methanol and ammonia?,"The Swedish company EURENCO Bofors produces a liquid mono-propellant, called LMP-103S, as a substitute for hydrazine by dissolving 65% ammonium dinitramide in 35% water solution of methanol (CH3;0H) and ammonia (NH3). LMP-103S has 6% higher specific impulse and 30% higher impulse density (see below) than hydrazine mono-propellant [25]. LMP-103S has been tested on the PRISMA (Prototype Research Instruments and Space Mission technology Advance- ment, COSPAR designation 2010-028B and 2010-028F) mission in 2010. "
What are the primary functions of mono-propellant rocket engines in satellite operations?,"Rocket engines using mono-propellants are simple, require only one tank for the propellant, and can be readily turned on and off. They are mainly used to perform such functions as orbit maintenance and attitude control of satellites.. "
What are the two main components of a liquid bi-propellant used in rocket engines?,"A liquid bi-propellant comprises two substances, namely a fuel and an oxidiser, which are held in separate tanks. They are not mixed before being injected into the combustion chamber of a rocket engine. They may be fed to the combustion chamber either by pumps or by pressure in the tanks, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]. In a pump-fed engine (left), the liquid fuel (H2) picks up heat, as it circulates through the coolant jacket of the thrust chamber, becomes gaseous, and drives a turbine. "
What components are utilized for thrust regulation and maintaining mixture ratio in the described engine cycle?,"The gas exhausted by the turbine is then injected into the combustion chamber. This arrangement is called the expander cycle. Control in this cycle is achieved by using: (a) the turbine valve to regulate the thrust, and (b) the mixture valve to maintain the desired mixture ratio. In a pressure-fed engine (right), the pressure in the propellant tanks is sufficient to force the two propellants (Hz and O>) through the injector into the combustion chamber. "
What component regulates the pressures in supply tanks to achieve the desired mixture proportion in the combustion chamber?,"The fuel (H2) first circulates through the coolant jacket, and is then delivered to the combustion chamber. In a pressure-fed engine, the pressures in the supply tanks can be regulated to yield the desired pressure and mixture ratio in the combustion chamber [26].

What are the operational advantages of using bi-propellants over mono-propellants in rocket engines?,"Liquid-propellant rocket engines using bi-propellants have higher performance than those using mono-propellants, as shown in the general table of Sect. 1.3. In addi- tion, the former are often easier to operate than the latter, particularly in consideration of the risks connected with the use of hydrazine."
What is the function of a spark plug igniter in a bi-propellant rocket engine?,"When the fuel and the oxidiser react spontaneously, as is the case with the hyper- golic substances described in Sect. 1.2, then no ignition device is needed in a liquid- propellant engine. Otherwise, an ignition device is necessary in the combustion chamber of a bi-propellant rocket engine. Some of these devices are briefly described below. One of them is a spark plug igniter. A spark plug igniter is a small combus- tion chamber having two spark plugs. "
What component generates the initial flame necessary to initiate combustion in the main thrust chamber of an engine?,"It provides the flame to ignite the propellant (fuel and oxidiser) in the main thrust chamber. When the engine is started, the spark exciters energise the spark plugs as the oxidiser and the fuel flow to the spark igniter. As the gaseous oxidiser and fuel enter this small combustion chamber, they mix and are touched off by an electrical spark. The pilot flame provided by the spark igniter lights off the main combustion chamber. A spark plug igniter is capable of multiple re-ignitions.. "
What component of the Rocketdyne J-2 engine integrates with the thrust chamber injector to ignite the rocket fuel?,"The Rocketdyne J-2 rocket engine had a particular spark plug igniter unit, called augmented spark igniter or spark torch igniter, which formed an integral part of the thrust chamber injector, as shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of the United States Air Force [27].

What is the purpose of the dual-redundant igniter during the engine start sequence?,"The dual-redundant igniter was used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters were turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining [28]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of the United States Air Force [27], shows the position of the augmented spark igniter in the J-2 rocket engine. Yatet Dect Foot met OR erg oxseszer. "

What components are typically found in the clump of materials used in a pyrotechnic igniter?,"A pyrotechnic igniter is set off by an electric current, which heats a bridge wire enclosed in a clump of easily ignited materials. Each of these materials, in turn, comprises an oxidiser (usually potassium perchlorate or potassium nitrate) and a fuel (usually titanium, or titanium hydride, or zirconium, or zirconium hydride, or boron). Such materials, when ignited by the hot wire, generate sparks and hot gases due to the chemical reaction between the oxidiser and the fuel. "
What type of device is used for igniting propellant in a combustion chamber and is designed for a single use only?,"These, in turn, ignite the mixture of gaseous propellant in the combustion chamber. Pyrotechnic igniters are safe and reliable. They are one-shot devices, and therefore cannot be used to re-start a rocket engine [30].. "
What is the definition of a pyrophoric fluid and how does it ignite?,"Still another ignition method used for liquid propellants consists in injecting some spontaneously ignitable fluid, called a pyrophoric fluid, ahead of the propellant. Pyrophoric substances (for example, ferrous sulphide and many reactive metals) have the property of igniting spontaneously, that is, without an external source of heat, upon exposure to air, moisture in the air, oxygen, or water. Such substances may be solid, liquid, or gaseous. "
"What type of atmosphere allows for the safe handling of pyrophoric substances, excluding any specific exceptions?","Most of them are metals and react spontaneously with oxygen only when they are in a very finely divided state. Pyrophoric substances are a special class of hypergolic substances (described in Sect. 1.2), because the oxidising agent for the former class is restricted to atmospheric oxygen [31]. They can be handled safely in atmospheres of argon or, with a few exceptions, nitrogen. A list of pyrophoric materials can be found in [32]. "
Identify and describe three distinct techniques used to initiate combustion in aerospace applications.,"These three methods of ignition (electric spark, chemical injection, and pyrotechnic) are shown together in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [33].  ELECTRIC CHEMICAL PYROTECHNIC SPARK INJECTION. "
How can liquid propellants be ignited using an additional device that creates hot gas for the main combustion area?,"Finally, liquid propellants can also be ignited by using a small combustor, wherein pyrotechnic devices or electric spark plugs ignite the propellant. The hot gas produced, in turn, ignites the propellant in the main combustion chamber."
What defines a gas as being cryogenic in terms of temperature and heat removal?,"Fundamental concepts on cryogenic propellants have been given in Sect. 1.2. The scope of cryogenics has been defined by NASA ([34], page 1) as follows: “Cryogenics is the discipline that involves the properties and use of materials at extremely low temperatures; it includes the production, storage, and use of cryogenic fluids. A gas is considered to be cryogenic if it can be changed to a liquid by the removal of heat and by subsequent temperature reduction to a very low value. "
What temperature threshold do researchers generally use to classify a substance as cryogenic?,"The temperature range that is of interest in cryogenics is not defined precisely; however, most researchers consider a gas to be cryogenic if it can be liquefied at or below —240 °F. The most common cryogenic fluids are air, argon, helium, hydrogen, methane, neon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Other gases that are being used in space probes and high-energy liquid- propellant rockets include fluorine and nitrogen trifluoride.”. "
What is the temperature threshold for gases to be classified as cryogenic propellants?,"In accordance with the preceding definition, by cryogenic propellants we mean gases which can be liquefied at or below 122 K. The most common cryogenic propellants for rocket applications are liquid oxygen (Oz), liquid hydrogen (Hz), liquid fluorine (F2), and oxygen difluoride (OF2), or mixtures of some of these substances.. "
What measures can be implemented to minimize temperature increases during the storage of propellants?,"These propellants should be stored and handled in such a way as to reduce the increase in their temperature of storage to a minimum. This temperature depends on the particular propellant and also on the time of storage. The thermal insulation techniques used for reservoirs should reduce the increase in temperature. The gases developed from the evaporating liquids should have a venting system, in order to allow them to escape. "
What factors must be considered when selecting materials for engines utilizing cryogenic fuels to ensure optimal performance?,"Accurate control should be exerted on the environmental humidity. In addition, the design adopted and the materials selected for rocket engines using cryogenic propellants should take account of the properties of such propellants. These disadvantages are offset by high values of specific impulse, as has been shown in Sect. 1.2.. "
What advantages do storable liquid propellants provide over cryogenic liquid propellants regarding stability and reactivity with storage materials?,"In contrast with cryogenic liquid propellants, storable liquid propellants are stable over a wide range of temperature and pressure, and are also scarcely reactive with the materials used for their reservoirs. Therefore, they can be stored for periods of  a year or more. These properties make them readily available and reliable. They are used in military vehicles and in upper stages of space vehicles.. "
What is a characteristic benefit of using Aerozine 50 and its oxidiser regarding storage temperature and maintenance?,"For example, a liquid storable fuel is Aerozine 50 (see Sect. 1.2), which is a 50/50 mixture by weight of hydrazine (H2NNH>) and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H2NN(CH3)2). Aerozine 50 is used with nitrogen tetroxide (NOx) as the oxidiser, with which it is hypergolic. This combination of fuel and oxidiser is storable at room temperature, and therefore a loaded missile can be stored for several years without the maintenance requirements associated with cryogenic propellants. "
"What fuel, developed in the 1950s, is utilized in ICBM rocket engines and interplanetary probes for efficient propulsion and storage?","This fuel was developed in 1950s by Aerojet General Corporation for the Titan Il ICBM rocket engines, and has been used in Aerojet’s Titan liquid rocket engine [35] and Delta II stage 2 engine [36]. Aerozine 50 is mainly used for interplanetary probes and spacecraft propulsion, and is also used for intercontinental ballistic missiles, which require long-term storage and launch on short notice. Another liquid storable fuel, also used with nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as the oxidiser, is UH 24, which is a mixture of 75% unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H2NN(CH3)2) and 25% hydrazine hydrate (HyNNH> - H2O). "
What type of propellant is characterized by spontaneous ignition upon contact between its components and was utilized in specific rocket versions and a satellite launch vehicle?,"This combination is also hypergolic, and has been used in the Ariane rocket versions 2 through 4 [37], and also in the Indian Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III [38].. "
What are the purposes of adding substances to liquid propellants in terms of combustion and performance characteristics?,"The liquid propellants indicated above are sometimes mixed with additive substances, which are meant to either facilitate ignition, or stabilise combustion, or reduce corrosive effects, or lower freezing point, or improve cooling properties of propellants. Some attempts have been made to promote hypergolicity in propellants by adding substances in the cryogenic oxidiser or in the fuel. An account on these attempts has been given by Clark [39].. "
"What potential risk is associated with incorporating hypergolic additives into fuels, as mentioned by the referenced author?","In particular, it has been proposed to add aluminium tri-ethyl (Alo(C2Hs)¢) to the fuel, or ozone fluoride (03F>) to the oxidiser. According to Dickinson [40], using hypergolic additives to fuels is not a good practice, because it increases the danger of inadvertent ignition on exposure of the fuel to air. The additive might be injected as a secondary stream in the fuel ahead of the combustion chamber, but this would imply an added complication in the design of a rocket engine. "
What is the primary safety concern when handling oxidisers in relation to mixing with other substances?,"It seems better to mix additives to the oxidiser, because the danger is confined to direct mixing of fluid with oxidiser, or to direct spilling of the oxidiser on combustible materials.. "
What is the term for the ideal oxidiser to fuel ratio that ensures complete combustion without excess oxidiser in rocket engines?,"As has been shown in Sect. 1.2, there is a mixture ratio (o/f), called the stoichio- metric mixture ratio, between the oxidiser (0) and the fuel (f). The stoichiometric mixture ratio for a rocket engine is the ideal ratio of oxidiser to fuel that burns all fuel with no excess oxidiser. In practice, there is another mixture ratio, called the optimum mixture ratio, between the oxidiser and the fuel which leads to the maximum value of performance. "
What effect does exceeding the stoichiometric mixture ratio have on exhaust gas molar mass during combustion?,"The optimum mixture ratio is less than the stoichiometric mixture ratio, because the temperature of the flame reaches its maximum value when the quantity of fuel exceeds the value defined by the stoichiometric mixture ratio. This happens because a combustion richer in fuel generates an exhaust gas having a lower molar mass. The optimum mixture ratio varies slightly with the pressure in the combustion chamber. "
What factors might cause the selected mixture ratio to deviate from the ideal value during combustion processes?,"In practice, the actual value chosen for the mixture ratio may differ from the optimum value, because the temperature of the combustion chamber must be  kept within the limits imposed by the materials, or because of the coolant flow, or because the combustion must be made stable.. "
How does the density of a liquid propellant affect the design and mass of rocket storage systems and engines?,"The performance of a liquid propellant depends not only on its specific impulse, /,, but also on its density, because a low-density propellant implies large storage tanks, which in turn imply a high mass of a rocket engine. By contrast, a high-density propellant can be stored in small tanks and requires small pumps to be fed to the combustion chamber. This indicator of performance of a propellant combination is taken into account by means of the so-called impulse density, J,, which is defined as follows [6]:. "
"Define the term that represents the average specific gravity of a propellant combination, consisting of both oxidiser and fuel, in a dimensionless manner.","where 6,, is a dimensionless quantity, called average specific gravity of a propellantcombination (oxidiser and fuel), defined as follows"
What does the ratio r represent in terms of weight mixture for oxidiser and fuel in a propellant combination?,"r = o/f is the oxidiser-to-fuel weight mixture ratio, 5, is the specific gravity (ratio of the density of a given substance to the density of water at 277 K and atmospheric pressure) of the oxidiser, and 6, is the specific gravity of the fuel. Since dy, is a dimensionless quantity, then the impulse density, Jy, of a propellant combination is measured in seconds, as is the case with the specific impulse, /,. "
What information can be obtained regarding the performance of propellants based on specific gravities and other parameters from the provided references?,"Specific gravi- ties of various propellants as a function of temperature are given in [6], page 243. Values of J, and Jy for various propellants are given in [4], pages 25, 26, and 27. Further performance data, in terms of J, and Jy, concerning liquid hydrocarbons and aluminium-hydrocarbon fuels, are given in [41], pages 5, 6, and 8.. "
What are the criteria outlined by Huzel and Huang for choosing a propellant combination for a specific application?,A propellant combination for a specific application is chosen taking into account the advantages and the disadvantages of each combination. It is often necessary to adopt a compromise. Some criteria to be considered in a choice have been identified by Huzel and Huang [4]. They are:
What factors contribute to achieving high specific impulse in propellant systems?,"e high release of energy per unit mass of propellant, combined with low molar mass of the gases resulting from combustion or decomposition, in order to have high values of specific impulse;"
What characteristics of a propellant contribute to reducing the volume and weight of storage systems while ensuring effective cooling capabilities?,"e high density of the propellant or high impulse density, in order to reduce the volume and the weight of the tanks and the pumps;e capability possessed by the propellant of cooling effectively the thrust chamber;e low vapour pressure of the propellant a temperature of about 344 K, for low weight of tanks and pumps;"
What is the maximum freezing point of the propellant that allows for effective engine operation in low-temperature conditions?,"e low freezing point of the propellant, possibly less than 219 K, for easy engine operation at low temperatures; "
What are key properties that ensure safety and efficiency for storable propellants in engine applications?,"e absence of corrosiveness and compatibility of the propellant with the materials used for the engine;e high boiling point, possibly above 344 K, for storable propellants;e low viscosity, possibly less than 0.01 Ns/m/, to reduce pressure drops through the feed system and the injector;e high thermal and shock stability, to reduce risks of explosion and fire;"
What characteristic of a propellant is indicated by reduced harm to health from its components and the substances formed during its use?,e low toxicity of the propellant itself and its reaction products;
What series of events characterize the constant conditions observed during the combustion process in a liquid-propellant rocket engine?,The combustion process which occurs in steady-state conditions in a liquid-propellantrocket engine can be described by the following sequence of events.
What process is used to cause the breakup of liquid jets in combustion chambers?,"The propellants are injected from a distributing manifold into the combustion chamber of the engine through orifices. The propellants are in the form of liquid jets. These jets are made to break up into small droplets, which then vaporise at high temperature in the combustion chamber. The breakup of the jets is often achieved by causing two or three of like (or sometimes unlike) substances to impinge. "
What type of engine involves the mixing of reactive vapours from fuel and oxidiser resulting in hot gases flowing through a nozzle?,"The impinging jets produce thin liquid sheets or fans which disintegrate rapidly. In bi- propellant engines, the reactive vapours containing fuel and oxidiser get mixed one with the other. The mixed vapours interact, and the hot gases resulting from the combustion process flow out of the combustion chamber toward the throat of the nozzle. Due to various reasons, the actual combustion process in steady state may be more complex than the ideal process described above, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [42].. "
What design feature of injectors enhances the mixing or atomization of liquid propellants prior to combustion?,"A reason is the internal shape of some injectors, which are designed so that the liquid propellants flowing through them are partially or totally mixed, or broken up into droplets, or vaporised before entering the combustion chamber. This effect can also be obtained by injecting controlled streams of gases into the injector passages, or by using other means."
What type of reactions can occur in a condensed state involving specific propellants prior to mixing or vaporizing?,"Another reason is the occurrence of combustion reactions in condensed phase with certain propellants, before their mixture or vaporisation."
What is the effect of lack of mixing on heterogeneous reactions in the liquid phase using hypergolic propellants?,"Still another reason is the occurrence of heterogeneous reactions in the absence of mixing in liquid phase, as is the case with some combinations of hypergolic propellants."
What causes an incomplete mixture of fuel and oxidiser in a combustion chamber?,"Still another reason is an incomplete mixture of fuel with oxidiser in gaseous phase. This happens near the walls of the combustion chamber, where fuel-rich streams are intentionally sprayed for purposes of cooling. This also happens because of condensed phases which may be present in the mixture of the combustion products, when the propellants used contain either metals or carbon. This also happens because part of combustion products may recirculate back to the vicinity of the injector plate  between spray fans, instead of going directly toward the nozzle, thereby causing a fraction of gas to remain in the combustion chamber for a long time.. "
What effect does exceeding the critical pressure level of propellants have on the state of matter in the combustion chamber?,"Still another reason is the pressure level in the combustion chamber, which may increase above the critical point of one or both of the propellants, thereby causing the sharp distinction between liquid and gas to disappear."
What occurs during the interaction between droplets and vapor during atomization in a liquid stream?,"PROPELLENT INJECTION LIQUID STREAM ATOMIZATION VAPOUR STREAM IMPINGEMENT Pd Sosa.

"
What factors can cause the actual combustion process to vary from the simplified models?,"Due to one or more of these reasons, the actual combustion process may differ from the simple process indicated above. Analytical models of the combustion phenomena are described at length in [42, 43]."
"How are the segments in a cylindrical combustion chamber arranged, and what factors influence their thickness and surface shape?","The phenomena which occur in a combustion chamber of cylindrical shape can be described by dividing the combustion chamber into a series of adjacent cylindrical  segments, stacked onto one another in the axial direction from the injection plane to the inlet plane of the nozzle. The thickness of each segment, the phenomena which actually occur into it, and the shape of its surfaces of separation from the adjacent segments depend on factors such as the specific combination of propellants used, the operating conditions (pressure, temperature, mixture ratio, et c.), and the type of injectors. The surfaces which separate two adjacent cylindrical segments are not planar, but have undulations which vary with time.. "
What is the temperature range of gaseous fuel in a rocket engine that has previously cooled the combustion chamber walls?,"The combustion phenomena in a rocket engine depend on the combination of propellants used. For example, when the fuel is liquid hydrogen which has been used, before injection, to cool the walls of the combustion chamber, then this fuel is in the gaseous state at a temperature varying from 60 to 500 K [6]. In such conditions, there are neither droplets of liquid hydrogen nor evaporation."
What considerations must designers keep in mind to prevent local explosions when using specific types of propellants in their applications?,"When the liquid propellants used are hypergolic, then an initial chemical reaction occurs in liquid phase at the moment in which a droplet of fuel impinges on a droplet of oxidiser. Therefore, care must be taken by the designer to avoid local explosions and excessive releases of energy which could generate shock waves."
What factors influence the stability of combustion in the segment adjacent to the injector plate?,"The cylindrical segment immediately adjacent to the injector plate is known as the injection-and-breakup zone, where two different liquid propellants enter through the orifices of the injector. This happens with either storable propellants or combinations of liquid oxygen with hydrocarbons. The injection velocities range from about 7 to 60 m/s [6]. The type of injector used (including the pattern, the size, the number, and the distribution of the orifices) has a strong influence on the behaviour and in particular on the stability of the combustion in this zone. "
What factors can affect the breakup of propellant streams into droplets during an injection process?,"The same influence have the pressure drop, the configuration of the manifold, or the roughness of the walls of the injection ducts. In this zone, the individual jets or streams of propellants break up into droplets by impingement of one jet with another or with a surface, or by inherent instability of liquid sprays, or by interactions of liquids with gases having different velocities and temperatures. "
What processes contribute to the evaporation of droplets in a zone with liquid and vaporized substances?,"These droplets are heated by radiation coming from the next zone (called rapid combustion zone) and also by convection of gas in the injection-and-breakup zone. This heat causes the droplets to evaporate and create regions rich in either fuel vapour or oxidiser vapour. The injection-and-breakup zone is heterogeneous, because it contains liquid propellants, vaporised propellants, and hot gases resulting from combustion products. "
How do variations in mass flow rates and mixture ratios influence the evaporation process of injected liquids in propulsion systems?,"Since the propellants in liquid phase are located at discrete places, then large variations are present in mass flow rates, mixture ratios, sizes and distributions of droplets, and properties of resulting gases. The chemical reactions occurring in the injection-and-breakup zone generate heat at low rates, and hot gases may recirculate back to the injector plate. Such gases create vortices and turbulent motions which contribute to the initial evaporation of the liquids injected. "
"How does the injection velocity of gaseous hydrogen compare to that of liquid oxygen, and what effect does this have on the formation of droplets?","The processes described above occur in a different manner when one of the propellants is in the gaseous state. Such is the case with gaseous hydrogen coming in contact with liquid oxygen. Gaseous hydrogen has no droplets and does not evaporate. Since the injection velocity of gaseous hydrogen is much higher (above 120 m/s, according to [6]) than that of liquid oxygen, then shear forces act on the liquid jets, and such forces foster the formation and the evaporation of droplets. "
What type of injector assembly is utilized in the J-2 rocket engine for coaxial-tube injection of propellants?,"This case requires the use of an injector of a particular type, which differs  from the injectors used for two propellants entering the combustion chamber in the liquid state. To this regard, the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [42], shows an injector assembly of coaxial-tube injection elements like that used in the J-2 rocket engine. In this assembly, which is typical of an O/H» concentric orifice injector, the oxygen tubes are recessed and hydrogen enters the injection elements through inlet holes or slots in their sleeves. "
What is the term for the cylindrical section next to the injection area where fast and intense chemical reactions take place?,"mm Liquid oxygen Pa Y Liquid oxygen itl ve N H Am, TY Gan ra > ry N74) yi iv WN | Wy ES OI i AV A H7/pevernen YY TY \ | Y AH Hin Hi Sleeve 4\ NY) Yj yy | AY YN | NY Au a Ki AN | NA /) Porous face plate y Thrust chamber tubes Entarged view: of element Y The cylindrical sector contiguous to the injection-and-breakup zone in the direc- tion of the nozzle is called rapid combustion zone. In this zone, rapid and intense chemical reactions occur at increasing high temperatures. "
What happens to the density and velocity of burning gas as it moves through a region of rapid fuel oxidation?,"Droplets of propellants which may be left are vaporised by convective heat. Consequently, fuel-rich and fuel-lean gases are mixed. The oxidation of the fuel occurs rapidly in this zone, and generates heat at higher rates than those of the preceding zone, with consequent decrease in density and increase in velocity of the burning gas. The chemical compo- sition and the mixture ratio become more uniform as the burning gas moves through this zone. "
What is the term used for the cylindrical region adjacent to the rapid combustion area in which oxidation reactions persist at a diminished rate?,"The axial component of the velocity vector of a molecule of combusted gas moving along a stream line becomes gradually greater than its transverse component. The cylindrical sector contiguous to the rapid combustion zone in the axial direc- tion is called stream tube combustion zone. In this zone, oxidation reactions continue to occur, but at a lower rate than that of the previous zone. The gas mixture approaches an equilibrium composition. "
What is the typical range of the axial velocity component for a gas molecule in the described environment?,"The axial component of the velocity vector (ranging from 200 to 600 m/s, according to [6]) of a gas molecule is much higher than its transverse component, and therefore there is little turbulent mixing between gaseous layers. The residence time of a gaseous molecule in the stream tube combustion zone is little in comparison with its residence time in the previous zones. The shape of the  stream lines, the inviscid flow, and the tendency of the combustion products toward chemical equilibrium persist in the stream tube combustion zone.. "
How does turbulence affect the characteristics of the flame front in a combustion chamber?,"The burning process which actually takes place in a combustion chamber is to be considered as a series of events which occur rather simultaneously than sequentially. Due to turbulence phenomena occurring in various degrees in all of the three zones indicated above, the flame front in a combustion chamber is not a planar surface."
What is the approximate duration that individual molecules remain in the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant rocket engine?,"The time spent by single molecules of reactants or combustion products in the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant rocket engine is of the order of magnitude of 10 ms. The heat release per unit volume is about 3.7 x 10° J/m3, which value is much higher than in a turbojet. In addition, the higher temperatures reached in the combustion chamber of a rocket engine cause chemical reactions to occur at much higher rates than in a turbojet [6].. "
What are the two circumstances in which transients can be introduced during combustion processes?,"Transients can be induced in the process of combustion either intentionally, as is the case with engine start-up or shut-down, or because of the insurgence of undesired phenomena of instability."
"What phenomenon can occur in the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant rocket engine due to small disturbances, resulting in sustained pressure oscillations?","As will be shown at length in Chap. 2, the combustion chamber of a liquid- propellant rocket engine is normally designed to operate in steady state or in condi- tions which vary slowly with time. However, an unstable behaviour may occur there as a result of small perturbations, which cause self-sustaining oscillations of pres- sure in the burning gas. The frequencies of these oscillations vary in a wide range. "
What is the range of frequencies measured in a combustion chamber according to determined parameters?,"Specifically, frequencies going from less than 100 Hz to over 15,000 Hz have been measured in the combustion chamber at amplitudes going from 10 to 1000% of the pressure in steady state [42].. "
What are the potential issues that may arise from structural vibrations caused by oscillating pressure in the combustion chamber?,"According to Culick and Kuentzmann [43], the energy taken by these oscillations is only a small part of the chemical energy made available by the propellants. There- fore, except in very severe instances, the mean thrust or the steady power of the engine is not affected by the oscillations. However, serious problems may arise because of structural vibrations excited by the oscillating pressure in the combustion chamber, and also because of oscillations of the thrust generated by the engine. "
What effect can increased heat transfer rates between gases and chamber surfaces have on the structural integrity of the combustion chamber?,"In addition, the heat transfer rates between the hot gas and the internal surface of the combustion chamber can be highly increased, with consequent erosion of the chamber wall.. "
What causes the instability in the motion of hot gas in a rocket vehicle?,"The unstable motion of the hot gas is self-excited as a result of an interaction of the combustion process with the structural modes of the rocket vehicle. This instability arises because a very small part of the chemical energy contained in the propellants is sufficient to produce large unsteady motions, and also because the processes tending to attenuate such motions are weak, unless appropriate steps are taken.. "
What phenomenon occurs in the feed lines of large rocket vehicles due to feedback interactions during operation of their initial stage?,"An example of these self-sustained oscillations is provided by the so-called pogo instability (see Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9, and Chap. 7, Sect. 7.6), which occurs in the feed lines of large liquid-propellant rocket vehicles, such as space launch vehicles or ballistic missiles. This particular instability is due to a feedback interaction between  the propulsion system and the structure of a rocket stage, and occurs principally in the first longitudinal mode of the structure of the vehicle during operation of its first stage.. "
"What is the minimum frequency, in Hertz, associated with the most destructive form of combustion instability known as acoustic instability?","The most destructive type of combustion instability is characterised by oscillations of high frequency, and is also known as acoustic instability. The frequencies of these oscillations are equal to or greater than 1000 Hz [4]."
"What phenomenon relates pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber to calculated acoustic resonance, specifically regarding modes of high-frequency instability?","The term acoustic instability is due to an observed correspondence, in both frequency and phase, between the pressure oscillations observed experimentally in a combustion chamber and the oscillations calculated for the acoustic resonance of the chamber. High-frequency instability includes both longitudinal and transverse modes, and the latter include, in turn, radial and tangential modes."
What is required for instability to be sustained in high-frequency scenarios involving rocket engines?,"In general terms, a source of oscillating energy is necessary to sustain instability. In the particular case of high-frequency instability, the source of oscillating energy is the combustion of the propellants used in a rocket engine, and depends weakly on the feed system of the engine. The oscillating energy must, to sustain instability, be properly phased in time with the oscillating pressure, as will be shown at length in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9.. "
What mechanisms have been suggested to sustain high-frequency instability related to chemical reactions and physical interactions?,"Sustaining mechanisms which have been proposed for high-frequency instability include loss of ignition, sensitive chemical preparation time, physical time delays, detonation processes, pressure or temperature sensitive chemical kinetics, the burst of droplets heated beyond their critical temperature and pressure, and the shattering and mixing of the streams, fans, or drops by the motion of gas particles [42].. "
What characterizes a rocket engine's ability to return to steady operation after experiencing large perturbations?,"Instability in a combustion chamber may start either spontaneously or as a result of some artificial perturbation. Acoustic instability may have a threshold amplitude, above which a perturbation is sustained and below which the same perturbation is damped. A rocket engine is said to be inherently stable, when it can absorb large perturbations and yet return to its operation in steady state. The degree of inherent stability of a rocket engine can be measured by rating devices which provide artificial perturbations to its combustion chamber. "
What factors related to operating conditions can influence the performance of propellants in a combustion chamber?,"Such perturbations involve operating condi- tions, such as mixture ratio of the propellants, pressure in the combustion chamber, temperature of the fuel, and so on.. "
What type of instability occurs without an initial disturbance and develops from inherent noise during a combustion process?,"An instability of the spontaneous type requires no initial perturbation to start, and grows out of the noise inherent to the combustion process. An instability of this type can be expected to occur just after an engine has reached its normal oper- ating conditions, because no perturbation is required for its occurrence. Variations in test conditions and the closeness to a stability boundary may sometimes delay the occurrence of a spontaneous instability.. "
What terms describe significant overpressure events in a combustion chamber during ignition or spontaneous occurrences during engine operation?,"Instability in a combustion chamber may also be induced by natural or artificial perturbations which may occur in the combustion process. Such perturbations are also known as spikes or pops, where a spike indicates a significant overpressure in the combustion chamber upon ignition of the engine, and a pop indicates a similar overpressure occurring spontaneously during engine operation at nominal pressure in the combustion chamber. "
What are the potential consequences of a high pressure spike in a combustion chamber at elevated altitudes?,"For example, at high altitudes, some combinations of hypergolic bi-propellants may start with an extremely high spike of pressure in the combustion chamber. This spike has been attributed to the explosion or deflagration  of the propellants collected in the combustion chamber or accumulated on its walls during the period of ignition delay. This spike of pressure may be of sufficient magni- tude to either cause destructive failure in the combustion chamber or adversely affect the guidance sensor systems. "
How does intermittent operation affect the thrust or total impulse of small rocket engines compared to a smooth start?,"In addition, for small rocket engines used for intermit- tent operation, the resultant thrust or the total impulse is seriously altered from that of a smooth start. For large engines, the ignition spike can trigger resonance in the combustion process, with consequent hardware destruction [42].. "
What must be assessed to evaluate the stability of a rocket engine when subjected to artificial triggers during flight?,"In most cases, the combustion process in a rocket engine shows a non-linear behaviour, which requires some kind of trigger, be it natural or artificial, to cause pressure oscillations of high frequency and amplitude in the combustion chamber. Consequently, it is necessary to determine the types and the magnitudes of the triggers which may occur in an engine during flight. This done, it is also necessary to evaluate the stability of that engine with artificial triggers of the assumed types. "
What phenomenon can cause a pressure oscillation to develop without an apparent initiating factor?,"However, as has been shown above, a pressure oscillation may in some cases grow out of combustion noise, in the absence of any observable trigger.. "
What are the necessary conditions for a rocket engine to maintain dynamic stability after experiencing operational transients?,"The dynamic stability of a rocket engine is concerned with the responses of the engine to transients occurring during its operation. A rocket engine must, to be dynamically stable, return to its normal operating conditions after transients of any type which may occur to it. In other words, in order for a rocket engine to be dynam- ically stable, the transients resulting from any type of operating conditions must die out, or the amplitudes of the subsequent sustained oscillations of pressure must be sufficiently small. "
What indicates that a rocket engine maintains dynamic stability during high amplitude pressure oscillations?,"In order to evaluate the dynamic stability of a rocket engine, the engine is driven by any means into pressure oscillations of high amplitude. If these oscillations subsequently decay to those proper to steady-state conditions, then there is sufficient assurance that no oscillations of high amplitude exist within the range of the given perturbations. A rocket engine, which has shown a dynamically stable behaviour within the range of the operating conditions expected in flight, should also remain stable in actual flight.. "
What term describes the confidence gained from conducting numerous tests to assess the reliability of a rocket engine?,"Another method which may be used to gain confidence in the stability of a rocket engine consists in conducting a large number of tests and flight. A confidence gained in this way is called statistical stability. This confidence indicates only that instability has rarely or never occurred in the operating condition tested, but not that instability can never occur."
What damping devices can be attached to injectors to enhance combustion stability in rocket engines without altering chamber dimensions or propellant feed system resistances?,"As will be shown at length in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9, the problem of assuring a stable combustion in an existing rocket engine (without changing the dimensions of the combustion chamber, the hydraulic resistances of the propellant feed system, the type of injector, the heat flux in the combustion chamber, and the engine performance) can be solved by using baffles, which are simple damping devices. Baffles can be mounted on existing injectors, in order to solve the stability problem with minimum effort and time. "
What component was designed with an even number of blades extending outward from a central hub in early injectors to assist in stability during the combustion process?,"The early injectors had baffles consisting of an even number of blades extending radially from a central hub. Later on, baffles have been used in conjunction with injectors having larger orifices in order to gain stability by modifying the combustion process [42].. "
What three techniques are utilized to evaluate the stability of a rocket engine's combustion process?,"Attempts made so far to induce artificial pressure perturbations in the combustion chamber of a rocket engine have used pulses of very short duration and sufficient  amplitude to excite the acoustic modes of the chamber. Sometimes, these pulses have been provided by explosive devices. Three types of techniques have been used to test the stability of combustion in a rocket engine. They are the inert gas (nitrogen or helium) pulse, the pulse gun, and the non-directional bomb.. "
What is the effect of the gas pulse technique in liquid oxygen and RP-1 burning engines?,"The first technique acts as a velocity perturbation to the combustion process, whereas the pulse gun and the non-directional bomb generate perturbations in both pressure and velocity by using explosives. Therefore, the resulting perturbation is of the triggered (or induced) type. A gas pulse has been used in engines burning liquid oxygen and RP-1. For such engines, this technique has been found effective in producing perturbations triggering sustained instability. A gas pulse has also been used in engines burning nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozine 50 with negligible effects on the combustion.. "
What components are typically included in the design of a pulse gun?,"A pulse gun is a device which resembles a gun. It consists of a breech into which an explosive charge is placed, usually in a cartridge case, a firing mechanism, a barrel, and often a diaphragm to protect the explosive charge from the environment of the combustion chamber of the engine. The barrel of a pulse gun is usually attached to the wall of the combustion chamber of the engine, in order for the pulse to be fired in the tangential direction or in the radial direction. "
What is the maximum mass of high explosive that can be contained in a pulse gun?,"A pulse gun is acted upon by a command given to its firing mechanism, which is usually a mechanical detonator acting on the main charge. The explosive charge of a pulse gun contains a mass of gun powder ranging from 194.4 to 259.2 mg, but may also contain a mass as high as 6480 mg of high explosive. A typical pulse gun is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [42].. "

"
What type of device is commonly utilized to create pressure variations in the combustion chamber during the development of liquid-fueled rocket engines?,"Unlike an inert gas pulse and a pulse gun, a non-directional bomb is usually mounted inside the combustion chamber and is not restricted to a location on the wall. Pulse guns and non-directional bombs can induce pressure perturbations ranging from 10 to 500% of the normal value in the combustion chamber. In the development of liquid-propellant rocket engines, non-directional bombs are the type of device most frequently used to induce pressure perturbations in the combustion chamber. "
What components are crucial for generating and directing thrust in a liquid-propellant rocket engine's propulsion system?,1.7 Principal Components of a Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engine A liquid-propellant rocket vehicle is composed of the following essential parts: e propulsion system; e structure of the vehicle: © guidance system; © payload; and © accessories. This book deals only with the propulsion system and its parts. The parts of the propulsion system considered here include only those which are strictly necessary to generate thrust and keep it in the desired direction.

What are the key stages involved in the combustion process of a bi-propellant engine?,"For a liquid bi-propellant rocket engine, the combustion process has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.5. It is summarised below for convenience of the reader. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license 63 to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines, Springer Aerospace Technology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_2 . "
What is the range of injection velocity for the fuel and oxidiser into the combustion chamber?,"(1) Firstly, the fuel and the oxidiser are injected, in the proper mixture ratio, into the combustion chamber through the elements of the injector, as shown in the preceding figure. The injection velocity ranges from about 7 to 60 m/s [2]. The droplets of the two propellants may either mix together in form of a spray or go separately into the combustion chamber."
What effect does the high temperature in the combustion chamber have on the droplets?,"(2) Then, the high temperature existing in the combustion chamber causes the droplets to vaporise."
What factors contribute to the increase in mass flow rate during the combustion process in a combustion chamber?,"(3) Then, the vaporised combination of fuel and oxidiser is further heated and burns at its stoichiometric mixture ratio, causing a continuous increase in mass flow rate in the combustion chamber. The combustion is aided by the high velocity of the molecules within the combustion chamber, and takes place completely upstream of the throat plane. Care must be taken by the designer in order for the combustion process to be stable, that is, free from shocks and detonation waves in the combustion front.. "
What occurs to the gas velocity as it passes through the narrowing section of a nozzle until it exits?,"(4) Finally, the combusted gas flows in the converging portion of the nozzle. The velocity of the gas increases in subsonic conditions (M < 1) and reaches the sonic value (M = 1) at the throat plane of the nozzle. The subsequent passage through the diverging portion of the nozzle causes the velocity of the gas molecules to increase further in supersonic conditions (M > 1). The combusted gas is then ejected from the thrust chamber through the exit plane of the nozzle.. "
What are the main components that make up the chamber responsible for producing thrust in rocket engines?,"The principal components of a thrust chamber are the injector including the propel- lant inlets and distributing manifolds, the ignition device (which is necessary in case of a rocket engine burning non-hypergolic propellants), the combustion chamber, the converging portion of the nozzle between the inlet plane and the throat, and the diverging portion of the nozzle between the throat and the exit plane. "
What components make up the thrust chamber assembly in a rocket engine using methane and liquid oxygen as propellants?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3] shows a thrust chamber assembly comprising the injector (left) and the combustion chamber including the converging portion of the nozzle (right), for a rocket engine whose propellants are methane and liquid oxygen.. "
"What shape is the combustion chamber described, and how does its cross-section change throughout its length?","i Va | 4 a) 3 as ui @: y i : - 3 a Y ) ; @\y eee Pe VAS a < = Ss ai “ ~) < Y a) NASA —  The combustion chamber illustrated in the preceding figure is a body of tubular shape. The cross-section narrows in the converging portion of the nozzle and reaches its minimum value at the throat. The diverging portion of the nozzle is usually bell- shaped, in order to allow the combusted gas to expand towards the exit section.. "
What functions does an injector perform in a rocket engine's combustion chamber concerning propellants?,"The injector has the purpose of distributing the propellants into the combustion chamber at the proper mixture ratio, pressure, and spray pattern, in order to initiate and sustain a stable combustion. A cutaway view of the injector used in the thrust chamber of a rocket engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (with gaseous fluorine for ignition only) is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [4].. "

What is the design purpose of drilling injection holes at angles in a specific type of injector?,"The particular injector shown above is of the shower-head type (described in Sect. 2.6), where both the fuel and the oxidiser injection holes are drilled at angles which allow the convergent streams of the propellants to meet at a common point placed at a given distance from the injector face."
What is the typical material composition and structural design of an injector used in fuel systems?,"Generally speaking, an injector is a round plate, having a honeycomb structure, with circular and radial inner passages, leading to drilled orifices. It is usually made of steel with nickel-plated surfaces, and is held in position at the fuel manifold below the liquid oxygen dome by means of high-strength bolts [5]."
What type of engine utilized an injector plate designed for the first stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [6], shows the injector plate used for the Rocketdyne H-1 engine, which was used for the S-I and S-IB first stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets. "
"What type of seals are used between the injector and thrust chamber body, and what material is chosen for their compatibility with the fuel?","The seals between the injector and the body of the thrust chamber are of the O- ring type, made of rubber selected for compatibility with the fuel. The H-1 engine cited above burns liquid oxygen and RP-1 (kerosene). A threaded hole is provided in the centre of the injector face to permit the installation of the igniter. The fuel and the oxidiser are kept separate by the distribution system. The injection orifices may be arranged at angles such that the impingement angles should be either equal (uni- planar impingement) or different (multi-planar impingement) for the two propellants.. "
What structure is positioned above the injector in the H-1 engine and is fastened in place?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [6], shows the liquid oxygen dome, which is bolted in position above the injector. This figure relates to the same H-1 engine indicated above.ws > 4 = 4 . = i &. sa | z oN . lo Ai \- - a a S ate. ? a 5 ee a 1¢ aad"
What material is used for the spiral gasket that seals the flanges between two components?,"The liquid oxygen dome provides the inlet to the liquid oxygen, and is also the attachment interface between the thrust chamber and the vehicle. It is a single-piece, aluminium alloy die forging. The liquid oxygen dome and the injector have flanges  which are sealed by a spirally wound gasket made of stainless steel strips with non- asbestos fillers (aramid or graphite fibres). The type of gasket used depends on the range of temperature in working conditions. "
What component of thrust-vector-controlled engines facilitates the mounting of gimbal bearings?,"For thrust-vector-controlled engines, as is the case, for example, with the Rocketdyne J-2 engine, the liquid oxygen dome also serves as a mount for the gimbal bearing. The thrust vector control of rocket engines will be considered in Sect. 2.2.. "
What type of electrical device is employed for the initiation of combustion in the engine and must be replaced post-operation?,"Finally, the pyrotechnic igniter of an engine is fired electrically, and is fixed to the injector surface by means of a threaded joint. It is designed for a single start, and must therefore be replaced after each firing. Igniters of this and other types will be described and illustrated at length in Sect. 2.8."
What is the purpose of modifying the direction of thrust in rocket or spacecraft propulsion systems?,"2.2. The Design of a Thrust Chamber for Thrust Vector Control The present paragraph concerns the methods used to control the direction of the thrust vector in a rocket or spacecraft. These methods are considered here in view of their bearing on the design of a thrust chamber, as will be shown below. By thrust vector control we mean the ability of a space vehicle to deflect the direction of the thrust away (that is, at an angle, 0, other than zero) from the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. "
"Identify the three types of rotations associated with an object's orientation in space, commonly referred to in aviation and aerospace contexts.","The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [7], shows the principal axes of inertia and the rotations in roll, pitch and yaw for the Space Shuttle. +Y PITCH Vertcal Ce Le ROLL 4 ; Longitudinal +X \ Lateral YAW of 2. "
What are the three main reasons that require adjustments in a vehicle's flight path and orientation?,"The necessity of this control arises from several causes. First, an intentional change of the direction of the flight path followed by the centre of mass of the vehicle. Second, an intentional change of attitude (or rotation) of the vehicle about one or more of  the principal axes of inertia passing through its centre of mass. Third, a correction of either the flight path or the attitude which becomes necessary in order for the vehicle to maintain the desired trajectory and orientation. "
What is the relationship between the thrust vector and the gravity force vector in a vehicle's propulsion system?,"Fourth, a correction of the misalignment between the thrust vector and the gravity force vector. As to the last issue, the thrust vector is applied to the nozzle of the vehicle, whereas the gravity force vector is applied to its centre of gravity, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [8]. Lift Drag Weight hs. "
What alignment of thrust and weight vectors is necessary to prevent unwanted torques on a vehicle?,"In order for the vehicle not to be subject to unwanted torques, the directions of the thrust and weight vectors must be aligned at w radians (180°). A rocket is also subject, when flying through the atmosphere, to aerodynamic forces (lift and drag), which are applied to its centre of pressure, not to its centre of gravity, as shown in the preceding figure."
"What occurs when forces create moments around the vehicle's principal inertia axes, affecting its rotation relative to the centre of gravity?","These forces produce moments about the principal axes of inertia of the vehicle. These moments, in turn, cause the vehicle to rotate about its centre of gravity. For a stable flight, the centre of gravity of a rocket must be above its centre of pressure. The longitudinal axis of the rocket, or the line joining the tip of the nose with the centre of the exit section of the nozzle, is called the roll axis, and a motion of the rocket about the roll axis is called a rolling motion. "
What axis is formed by the intersection of the pitch and yaw axes in relation to the rocket's center of gravity?,The centre of gravity of the rocket lies along the roll axis. The pitch and yaw axes are mutually perpendicular and form a plane passing through the centre of gravity and perpendicular to the roll axis. Pitch moments tend to either lower or raise the nose of the rocket. Yaw moments cause the nose to move from side to side.. 
What techniques can be implemented to alter rocket propulsion direction and achieve steering control?,"Both mechanical and aerodynamic methods can be used to re-direct the rocket thrust and provide the necessary steering forces. Some of such methods use static fins, movable fins, jet vanes, jetevators, canards, gimballed (that is, swivelled) nozzles, Vernier rockets, fuel injectors, and attitude-control rockets, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [9].  ee Caner er Center of oat es | ins m= Center of Pressure Force Force » Ry °, Movable Fins Gimbaled Thrust Vernier Rocket Thrust Vane. "
What must the size of static fins ensure to effectively counteract pitch and yaw deviations in a rocket's flight?,"As long as a rocket travels in the atmosphere, static fins at the tail of the rocket can generate aerodynamic forces which act at the centre of pressure and generate moments about the centre of gravity. These moments oppose the deflection of the rocket in the directions of the pitch and yaw axes. Of course, the static fins must be so sized as to generate the amount of aerodynamic forces required to counteract the deviations. "
What is the primary purpose of aerodynamic fins in atmospheric flight vehicles despite the drag they generate?,"On the other hand, the fins generate further drag, in the direction opposed to the rocket velocity vector. In spite of that, aerodynamic fins, be they fixed or movable, are very effective for controlling a vehicle flying through the atmosphere. They continue to be used in weather rockets, anti-aircraft missiles, and air-to surface missiles.. "
What is the function of a fixed device in a thrust vector control system for stabilizing a rocket?,"Generally speaking, a thrust vector control system used in a rocket may be either passive or active. A passive control system is a fixed device meant to stabilise a rocket by its very presence on the outside of the rocket. An example of such a device is a cluster of fins mounted around the lower end of a rocket, near the nozzle. The purpose of the fins is to keep the centre of pressure below the centre of gravity of the rocket.. "
What solutions have been developed to mitigate the issues related to increased drag and mass in control systems?,"In order to overcome the disadvantages (higher drag and mass) of the fins, active control systems have been developed. They are described below."
What type of surfaces are utilized to redirect exhaust gases in a rocket's jet stream?,"Jet vanes and movable fins are planar surfaces, which are used in the jet stream of a rocket to deflect the exhaust gases. They are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [10].  i P 4 { \ Center of mass \ ih  Sideward __—-7 7, Vane in Ott component Ne Vane vere. ii of thrust i) deflected position i ! Thrust Thrust"
What components are used in certain missile systems to redirect the exhaust gas jet from the main propulsion motors?,Thrust vanes have been employed on the V-2 and Redstone missiles to deflect the exhaust gas jet of the main propulsion motors by carbon vanes.
"What device, invented by Dr. Willy Fiedler, alters jet flow direction using a hinged mechanism over a rocket nozzle?","Jetevators, which are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Lock- heed [11], are control surfaces which can be moved into or against the jet stream of a rocket, in order to change the direction of the jet flow. The jetevator invented by Dr. Willy Fiedler is a solid ring with a spherical inside surface which is hinged over the rocket nozzle [12, page 52]. This device, which was used in the Al version of the Polaris missile and then replaced by rotatable nozzles in the A2 version, deflects the flow when turned into the exhaust stream. "
What is the device that can rotate into exhaust flow to create control force in solid-propellant rockets?,"It has the advantage of not causing propul- sion losses when in the neutral position, since, unlike vanes, it does not interfere with the exhaust flow [10]. The same device has also been described by Edwards and Parker as a semi-spherical shell hinged to a rocket nozzle and rotated, at the command of a sensing unit, into the exhaust flow to produce a control force. Jetevators have been most frequently applied to control the direction of thrust of solid-propellant rockets [10]. "
What are the aerodynamic surfaces called that are positioned at the front of a rocket or aircraft?," z r4 ® ® VIEW A-A ie & 8 x eres z A Ss LU [ ye \ 7 \ Sy A Canards are fore-plane surfaces mounted on the front end of a rocket or aircraft. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [13], shows such surfaces. L =o S \N ee. "
What distinguishes canards from movable fins in terms of their placement on a rocket?,"Movable fins and canards are quite similar to each other in appearance. The only real difference is their location on the rocket, because canards are mounted on the front end, whereas the movable fins are at the rear end. In flight, both of them tilt as rudders to deflect the air flow and cause the rocket to correct its course, in the event of unwanted directional changes being detected by motion sensors [14].. "
What is the purpose of a two-axis ring-suspension system in a rocket nozzle?,"Another method for changing the direction of the exhaust gases, and hence the direction of the rocket, is to gimbal the nozzle. For this purpose, the engine can be mounted in a two-axis ring-suspension system, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [15]. This figure, which relates to the engine gimbal system of the Viking Orbiter 1975, shows the two actuators mounted along directions parallel to, but not coincident with, respectively, the pitch axis (Y) and the yaw axis (Z) of the vehicle. This is because the origin of the roll, pitch, and yaw axes is the centre of mass of the vehicle.. "
What type of rocket engine was utilized by the Viking 1 orbiter for propulsion?,"The Viking 1 orbiter (NSSDCA/COSPAR ID: 1975-075A) was launched from Cape Canaveral on the 20th of August 1975. The propulsion of the Viking 1 orbiter was furnished by a bi-propellant (monomethy] hydrazine, CH3NHNH)p, and nitrogen tetroxide, N2O4) liquid-fuelled rocket engine which could be tilted up to 2/20 rad (9°). Attitude control during engine burns was provided in roll (X-axis) by the attitude control system (using 12 small compressed-nitrogen gas jets located at the solar panel tips), and in pitch and yaw by an autopilot which commanded the engine gimbal system shown above [16]..

What is the composition of the bearing surface in the described gimbal system that ensures low friction?,"This type of gimbal system has a highly loaded (1.38 x 10° N/m?) universal joint which is a spherical, socket-type bearing with a Teflon®/fibreglass composition coating which provides a dry, low friction bearing surface. It also has a lateral adjust- ment device for aligning the thrust chamber with the vehicle. This gimbal system transmits the thrust from the injector assembly to the thrust structure of the vehicle, and provides a pivot bearing for deflection of the thrust vector. "
"What purpose does a gimbal serve in a thrust control system for rockets, particularly regarding nozzle movement and thrust direction?","As shown in the preceding figure, the gimbal is mounted on the top of the injector and liquid oxygen dome assembly [17]. This gimbal bearing system has been used in the Saturn V rocket and in the Space Shuttle [14]. In a gimballed thrust control system, the nozzle of the rocket can be swivelled from side to side. As the nozzle direction is deflected away from the axis of symmetry of the rocket, so does the direction of the thrust change with respect to the centre of gravity of the vehicle.. "
What is the purpose of small rockets mounted externally on a primary thrust system?,"Ina Vernier thrust control system, small rockets are mounted on the outside of the main thruster. In case of need, such rockets are fired in the proper direction, in order to produce the desired course change [14]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [18], shows a Vernier rocket mounted on the outside of the Atlas rocket.  / eg - Attitude-control rockets, shown below, are used to trim misalignments of the translational thruster, the basic attitude control with respect to the body principal axes being provided by a separate set of thrusters.

Attitude-control rockets are used in the coasting phase of flight. For this  purpose, clusters of small rockets are mounted all around a space vehicle. By firing these small rockets in the proper combination, it is possible to turn the vehicle in the desired direction. "
What type of engine was utilized for translation by the ascent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module?,"After the vehicle has been aimed as required, the main engine is fired, in order to send the vehicle in the new direction. For example, the ascent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module used a fixed, high-thrust engine for translation and a series of small liquid-propellant rockets for attitude control, as shown in the preceding figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [19].. "
What are the implications of using mechanical methods for thrust vector control in high-temperature environments?,"The methods described above use, all of them, mechanical means to control the direction of the thrust vector. They require actuating components which must work efficiently in the high-temperature environment of the rocket exhaust and are invari- ably associated with a loss of axial thrust when performing manoeuvres of thrust vector control [20]."
What principle does co-flow fluidic thrust vectoring utilize for thrust direction control?,"Other methods use fluidic means to perform the same function. These methods use a static nozzle and the injection (or the removal) of a secondary flow into (or from) the region between the primary flow, which generates the thrust, and the nozzle. They do not require any kinematic structure and mechanical actuators. There is a variety of methods based on fluidic thrust vectoring, which differ one from the other by the way in which the secondary flow is used for thrust vector control. They may be classified as follows. © Co-flow for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is based on the Coanda effect. The. "
What is the effect called when a high-speed fluid stream adheres to a curved surface rather than traveling in a straight path?,"Coanda effect (so named after the Romanian engineer Henri-Marie Coanda) isthe phenomenon in which a stream of fluid, ejected at high speed from a slot andcoming in contact with a convexly curved surface, adheres to that surface along its curvature rather than continue to travel in a straight line. Seconda. a” Primary => ad »> flow > > » »"
How does the flow velocity influence pressure near a curved surface in a divergent wall?,"In other words, the stream is deflected from the axis of flow and follows the slope (or curvature) of a divergent wall whilst increasing in velocity and in mass by entraining additional fluid [21]. This happens because of the increase in the flow velocity over the curved surface, which causes pressure to decrease. The low pressure causes not only the injected co-flow but also the primary flow to be deflected off the nozzle axis toward the divergent wall, as shown in the preceding figure, where the  black arrows represent the primary flow, and the red arrows represent the injected co- flow. "
"Which fluidic method achieves the smallest deflection angle in thrust vector control, according to the study?","Of all the fluidic methods for controlling the thrust vector, the co-flow method has been found [22] to be the one which produces the smallest deflection angle. ¢ Counter-flow for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is also based on the Coanda effect to deflect the thrust vector, as shown in the following figure. Ramana = Suction collar suction flow te p =e =» remarry = Slow »> > » > Viscous [_ ens entrainment _ - Strykowski et al [23] have shown that the thrust due to a jet stream can be continu- ously deflected to at least 0.2793 rad (16°) by creating a secondary counter-flowing stream between the primary jet and an adjacent curved surface. "
What is the observed thrust loss percentage at Mach 2 due to asymmetric suction application?,"For this purpose, suction is applied asymmetrically between the trailing edge of a primary nozzle and an aft suction collar. This creates a low-pressure region along the suction collar, and causes the primary jet to turn [24). The results found by Strykowski et al. [23] at Mach 2 show that the thrust loss is less than 4% and the required mass flow rates are less than approximately 2% of the primary jet. "
What is the effect of asymmetric activation of co-flow on the direction of the primary flow in a fluidic thrust vectoring system?,"A co-flow, due to the viscous entrainment generated by the primary flow, takes place at the wall of the suction collar, and interferes with the primary flow. By activating asymmetrically this co-flow, the primary flow is deflected towards the side on which the suction flow is applied, due to the pressure drop which causes the thrust to turn [22]. e Throat-shifting for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is performed by injecting secondary flow at or just upstream of the throat, as shown in the following figure. "
What is the effect of using recessed cavities in a nozzle on the primary flow and sonic plane?,"By so doing, there is no formation of shock waves.  Primary flow »> »> »> » » This injection skews the sonic plane and deflects the flow. Another version of this method uses variable recessed cavities, which deflect the primary flow by means of vortices in the cavities, as shown in the following figure. > ES s » Sonic plane ~ nnd | The recessed cavity portion of the nozzle shown above is located between the upstream minimum area and the downstream minimum area of the nozzle itself. "
What dual techniques are employed in the combined method to enhance performance in fluidic thrust vectoring?,"The fluidic injection is performed at the upstream minimum area. A simulation study carried out by Deere et al. [25] has shown that substantial thrust-vector angles are obtainable without large penalties in thrust efficiency. This version is a combined method, because the recessed-cavity technique is used in addition to the throat-shifting technique in order to obtain greater performance. e Shock vector control for fluidic thrust vectoring, which is performed by injecting secondary flow downstream of the throat, as shown in the following figure. "
What effect does the injected flow have on the primary supersonic flow within the nozzle?," . Primary oe Slow >» » > >» » >» Shock The secondary injected flow acts as a compression ramp in the direction of the primary supersonic flow. This compression induces an oblique shock wave in the diverging portion of the nozzle at some angle with respect to the direction of the primary flow. The primary flow, when interacting with the oblique shock wave, turns away from the axis of symmetry of the nozzle. "
What are the advantages of utilizing fluidic thrust vectoring methods in aerospace vehicles compared to mechanical systems?,"This turn changes the direction of the thrust vector. By so doing, the direction of the primary flow does not change in the vicinity of the throat. The shock vector control may also be combined with the throat shifting, by using two ports instead of one to inject the secondary flow into the nozzle, as shown in the following figure. Primary o fow Shock — ° The aerospace vehicles which use fluidic instead of mechanical thrust vectoring methods have the advantages of being lightweight, free from moving parts, less expensive, easy to integrate, and less detectable by radars, the last advantage being of particular interest in military applications. "
What thrust vector angle was achieved by Strykowski et alii using the counter-flow method?,"On the other hand, they must be designed from the outset as such, and existing vehicles currently in use cannot be retrofitted. In addition, their capability of directional change is often held to be lower than that of vehicles using mechanical thrust vectoring. On the last issue, Strykowski et alii [23] have obtained a thrust vector angle of 0.2793 rad (16°) by using the counter- flow technique described above, and Wing and Giuliano [26] have obtained a value of up to 7/10 rad (18°) for this angle, by using the shock vector control technique. "
What is a significant drawback of fluidic thrust vectoring methods related to flow sources?,"Such values are by no means small in comparison with those cited by Sutton and Biblarz [2, page 611], Table 16.1 for mechanical thrust vectoring systems. They are  lower only than the value of zr/9 rad (20°), relating to the movable nozzle (rotary ball with gas seal). Another disadvantage of the fluidic thrust vectoring methods has been found in their need for a source of secondary flow. In the event of that source being the same as that of the primary flow which generates the thrust, it has been argued, the performance of the vehicle would decrease, at least in the phase of thrust vector control. "
What indicators are used to measure the performance of a rocket engine’s thrust chamber?,"As to the loss in performance, Strykowski et al. [23] have found, at Mach 2, a thrust loss lower than 4%, with the required mass flow rates being lower than approximately 2% of the primary jet. Consequently, the only strong disadvantage of the fluidic thrust vectoring methods seems to us to be the deficiency or insufficiency of data on their behaviour gathered by testing them in flight. 2.3 Performance of a Thrust Chamber The performance of the thrust chamber of a rocket engine is measured by some indicators, which have been discussed at length in Chap.

What happens to characteristic velocity when the length of a rocket engine's combustion chamber exceeds the value corresponding to its maximum?,"The characteristic velocity c* of a rocket engine increases with the characteristic length L* of its combustion chamber, and approaches asymptotically a maximum  value. This value has been determined experimentally for each combination of propel- lants. Consequently, it is not advantageous to increase L* beyond the value corre- sponding to the maximum value of c*, because a higher characteristic length implies higher volume and mass, a higher surface to be cooled, and higher losses due to friction at the chamber walls..

What are the prescribed values for the characteristic length of a combustion chamber when utilizing different propellant combinations?,"Recommended values of the characteristic length L* (m) of a combustion chamber for various combinations of propellants are given in the following table, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [5]."

What are the primary disadvantages of using an acylindrical combustion chamber compared to a cylindrical combustion chamber in terms of design and combustion efficiency?,"Acylindrical combustion chamber having a small cross section and a high length is subject to high losses due to the friction of the combusted gas with the chamber walls. In addition, it is difficult to place the necessary number of orifices in a planar surface of small cross section. On the other hand, a cylindrical combustion chamber having a large cross section and a small length leaves a space sufficient for propellant mixing but insufficient for a complete combustion. "
"What factors should be analyzed when selecting a shape, particularly regarding heat exchange and manufacturing difficulty?","Further considerations to be taken into account in choosing a shape concern heat transfer, stability of combustion, weight, and easiness of manufacturing.. "

In addition, for the same pressure and for the same strength of the materials used, the walls of a spherical combustion chamber can be less thick than those of a cylindrical combustion chamber. On the other hand, a spherical combustion chamber is more difficult to manufacture and offers a lower performance than is the case with a cylindrical combustion chamber. Therefore, a cylindrical combustion chamber is considered firstly, and other shapes will be discussed successively.. "
What contraction area ratio range is suggested for turbo-pump high-thrust engines according to Huzel and Huang?,"Let the cross-sectional area A; = 7 R? of the throat and the characteristic length L* of the combustion chamber be known for a cylindrical combustion chamber.

The former has a radial-flow section in the initial divergent region. This fact generates a uniform flow directed along the symmetry axis at the exit cross-section of the nozzle. In addition, the gradual change of the wall angle with respect to the axis prevents oblique shocks."
Which methods have been used to calculate the shape of a nozzle contour for maximizing thrust according to the study referenced?,"Some of the methods (in particular, those due to Prandtl-Busemann, Puckett, and Foelsch) to determine a nozzle contour have been described by Crown [29]. Rao [30] has applied the calculus of variations to determine the shape of a nozzle contour leading to the maximum thrust. For engineering purposes, near-optimum parabolic contours are suitable for many applications [28]."
What is the primary consideration for selecting the ideal configuration of a nozzle with a specific expansion ratio?,"According to Huzel and Huang [5], the optimum shape of a nozzle having a given expansion ratio is chosen on the basis of the following considerations: ¢ uniform parallel axial flow of the combusted gas at the exit section of the nozzle"
What are the primary design considerations for minimizing energy losses in a rocket nozzle?,"e minimum losses due to separation and turbulence within the nozzle;e shortest possible length of the nozzle for minimum requirements of space envelope, weight, losses due to friction at the walls, and cooling; andIn practice, the cone and the bell are the most frequently used of all shapes for the diverging portion of a rocket nozzle."
What are the key benefits of utilizing a conical nozzle compared to a bell-shaped nozzle in fluid dynamics applications?,"The advantages of a conical nozzle over a bell-shaped nozzle are easiness of manufacturing, and capability of increasing or decreasing its exit section, without the necessity of re-designing the full surface of the nozzle. The diverging portion of a conical nozzle is shown in the following figure.  R ke = 6R, R t . fet oe Ut SRO gTE AXIS bb Fie Ln te"
What is the range of the semi-aperture angle in the diverging section of a conical nozzle?,"On both sides of the throat plane, the contour of the nozzle is a circular arc, whose radius R ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 times the radius R, of the throat [5]. In the converging portion (not shown in the preceding figure) of the nozzle, the angle 6 of semi-aperture ranges from 7/9 rad to 7/4 rad (from 20 to 45°). The semi-aperture angle a of the diverging portion of the nozzle varies from about 7/15 rad to 2/10 rad (from 12 to 18°) [5]. The length L,, of the diverging portion of a conical nozzle is expressed by the following equation of [5]:. "
"What is the value commonly selected for the divergence angle of a conical nozzle, and why is this specific angle preferred?","In practice, 2/12 rad (15°) is the most frequently chosen value for the divergence angle a of a conical nozzle, for reasons of weight, length, and performance. In case of a conical nozzle, the velocity vector v, of the exhaust gas at the exit plane of the nozzle forms the divergence angle a with respect to the axis of symmetry of the nozzle. Therefore, not all the gas momentum is in the axial direction, there being a non-axial component of the exhaust gas velocity vector. This loss of axial momentum in a conical nozzle is taken into account by means of the factor. "
"What equation represents the thrust produced by a rocket engine with a conical nozzle, considering the ratio of gas momentum and pressure differences?","Xr ! d+ ) =. cosa@ 2 where A is the ratio between the momentum of the gases in a nozzle with a semi- aperture angle w and the momentum of an ideal nozzle with all gases flowing in the axial direction [2]. With this factor, the thrust of a rocket engine having a conical nozzle is [31]: F = hinve + Ac(Pe — Po)"
What is the relationship between the velocity of exhaust gas at the exit plane of a conical nozzle and the ideal nozzle condition?,"In the ideal case of all the gas momentum being in the axial direction at the exit plane of a nozzle, the factor A is equal to unity. In the case of a conical nozzle having a semi-aperture angle a = 7/12 rad = 15°, there results 4 = 0.983, and therefore  the velocity of the exhaust gas at the exit plane of a conical nozzle is in magnitude 98.3% of the velocity of the gas for an ideal nozzle."
What are the benefits of using a bell-shaped nozzle in terms of gas flow expansion and exit flow direction?,"For the purposes of reducing the length L,, of the divergent portion of a nozzle and increasing the performance, a bell-shaped nozzle has been studied. This type of nozzle offers the advantages of decreasing the portion of nozzle where the gas flow expands, and changing gradually the local angle of semi-aperture, so as to have a uniform, nearly axially directed flow at the exit plane. In addition, since the slope of the wall contour changes continuously, then the formation of oblique shocks is avoided. "
What semi-aperture angle defines the standard equivalent conical nozzle used to specify the length of a bell-shaped nozzle?,"The optimum contour for a bell-shaped nozzle which leads to the maximum magnitude of thrust has been determined in 1958 by Rao [30], by using the method of characteristics combined with the calculus of variations. Several computer programmes have subsequently been developed (see, for example, 32) in order to determine the optimum contour by applying the method described by Rao [30]. In practice, an equivalent conical nozzle having a semi-aperture angle a = 2/12 ~ 0.2618 rad = 15° is used as a standard to specify the length of a bell-shaped nozzle. "
"What does the term ""fractional length"" refer to in the context of a bell-shaped nozzle?","For example, a bell-shaped nozzle is said to have a fractional length Ly = n% when its true length L,,, measured from the throat plane to the exit plane, is. "
What is the significance of a nozzle's fractional length exceeding approximately 85% in relation to its correction factor?,"L,= wma -1+ 13( a6 - ‘)] 100 tan 0.2618 cos 0.2618 that is, when the true length L,, of that nozzle is n/100 times the length of a conical nozzle having a semi-aperture angle w = 2/12 rad = 15°, the same radius R, at the throat plane, and the same expansion ratio ¢ = A,/A,. It has been proved experi- mentally that a bell-shaped nozzle whose fractional length Ly is greater than about 85% does not offer substantial advantages for the purpose of increasing the nozzle correction factor A, because an increase in length implies an increase in mass.

"
What is the relationship between the radius of the circular arc in the nozzle and the radius of the throat?,"This parabolic approximation is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5]. In the converging portion of the nozzle, immediately upstream of the throat plane, the nozzle contour is a circular arc, whose radius is equal to 1.5 times R,, where R; is the radius of the throat. This arc terminates at the point T, where T is the point in which this arc intersects the throat plane. The angle which subtends this circular arc is to be chosen by the designer. "
"What is the radius of the circular arc in the diverging section of the nozzle, expressed as a fraction of R?","In the diverging portion of the nozzle, immediately downstream of the throat plane, the nozzle contour is also a circular arc, whose radius is equal to 0.382 times R;. This circular arc goes from the point T to the point of inflection N, where N is the point in which the parabolic segment begins. The parabolic segment goes from to the point of inflection N to the point E, where E is the point in which the parabolic segment intersects the exit plane of the nozzle.  : 6.

What parameters must be known to design a specific bell-shaped nozzle?,"In order to design a specific bell-shaped nozzle, the following data must be known: the radius R, of the throat, the true length L,, of the nozzle (measured from the throat plane to the exit plane along the axis of symmetry of the nozzle), the expansion area ratio ¢ = A_/A,, the angle 0,, which the tangent in N to the parabola forms with the axis of symmetry, and the angle 0, which the tangent in E to the parabola forms with the axis of symmetry.. "
How can the actual length of a bell-shaped nozzle be calculated using the fractional length related to a conical nozzle's semi-aperture angle?,"Of course, the true length L,, of a bell-shaped nozzle may be expressed in terms of the fractional length Ly, with reference to an equivalent conical nozzle having a semi-aperture angle 2/12 radians (15°)."
What determines the angles of a nozzle at maximum thrust according to Rao's findings?,"The values of the angles @,, and 6, are given in, respectively, the upper part and the lower part of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5], as functions of the expansion area ratio ¢ = A,/A,. The values of the angles 6,, and 0, are those of the optimal (maximum thrust) nozzle determined by Rao [30]."
What does experience indicate about the similarity of curves for varying values of the specific heat ratio in relation to expansion area ratios?,"This figure shows that the value of the angle 0, at the exit plane of the nozzle is never equal to zero. The same figure can also be found in [34, 35]. In particular, Newlands [35] has extrapolated the curves found by Rao [30] to values greater than 50 of the expansion area ratio ¢ = A,/A;. Experience has shown that these curves are substantially the same for all the values of the specific heat ratio y = cp/c, which are of practical interest. "

What method does Newlands propose for constructing a parabola between two specified points?,"In order to draw a parabola from the point of inflection N to the point of exit E, Newlands [35] has suggested to use an ancient geometrical method, which is briefly described below."
What is the total number of segments created when each of the two lines is divided into four equal parts?,"With reference to the following figure, adapted from [5], a straight line is drawn at an angle 0,, from N, and then another straight line is drawn back at an angle 0, from E. Let Q be the point of intersection of these straight lines. Next, both of these lines are divided into an equal number of segments, which is four in the following figure. The terminal points of these segments are labelled a, b, c and e, f, g. "
"What geometric shape is created by the intersections of straight lines drawn from points a, b, and c?","A straight line is drawn from point a to point e, then another from b to f, and another from c to g. These straight lines form a mesh, whose edge gives the parabola outline. This parabola is also tangent to the straight lines QN and QE. By using many more divisions, for example by means of a CAD package, there results a sharper contour. A series of straight-line segments results from removing most of the mesh. "
What method can be used to create a nozzle contour by connecting midpoints of segments with a smooth curve?,"By joining the midpoint of each segment with a smooth curve, such as a CAD spline, there results the nozzle contour.  6. 9 ee Q 2 f ¢ LSR, b PARABOLA 382 RWG R, = VE Rr N T Rt y CIRCLE Ly @ THROAT For the same purpose, an analytical method based on Bézier curves has also been suggested by Newlands [35]. Without loss of generality, this method is described below by means of a numerical example. With reference to the preceding figure, we consider a nozzle having a radius R, = 13.8 cm measured in the plane of the throat, an expansion area ratio ¢ = A,/A, = 70, and a fractional length Ly = 80% of a m/12-rad = 15° equivalent conical nozzle. "
What are the angles formed by the tangents to the nozzle contour at points N and E with respect to the x-axis?,"We want to determine the equation of the parabolic segment of nozzle going from the inflexion point N to the exit point E, where the axes x and y and their origin O are shown in the preceding figure. For this value of fractional length, the Rao curves give the angles 6,, = 0.5760 rad = 33° and 0. = 0.1222 rad = 7° which the tangents to the contour of the nozzle in the points respectively N and E form with the axis of symmetry (x-axis) of the nozzle. "
"Calculate the coordinates of point N using the angle and radius provided, given R equals 13.8 cm and the angle value is 0.5760 radians.","These wall angles result from extrapolating the graphs given above.

What type of mathematical curve can represent the parabolic segment of a nozzle based on known coordinates of specific points?,"Since the co-ordinates of the points N, Q, and E are known, then the parabolic segment of nozzle going from N to Ecan be expressed by means of a Bézier quadratic curve having the following parametric equations"

Under what condition can a parabola be represented by the equation involving three coefficients related to its contour?,"In the general case, there may be no set of three coefficients a, b, and c whose values satisfy exactly the boundary conditions specified above, in order to express the contour of a nozzle by means of the equation y(x) = ax” + bx + c. Such is the case with the numerical example given above, since xg 4 (xy + Xz)/2.

What type of equation must the contour of a bell nozzle satisfy when specific continuity and boundary conditions are required?,"When the requirements posed to the designer of a bell nozzle are: (a) the continuity of its contour; (b) the continuity of its slope; and (c) the respect of the four boundary conditions specified above, independently of whether a parabola or any other smooth curve may be chosen, then the contour can be expressed by a cubic equation, as follows"

What is the significance of exhaust gas flow not aligning with the symmetry axis in annular nozzles?,"The exhaust gas generated within the combustion chamber need not flow along the axis of symmetry of the nozzle.

What type of nozzle is characterized by a propellant combusted into a circular ring near its base?,"Annular (or plug or altitude-compensating) nozzles are so called because the propellant is combusted into a ring, also called an annulus, which is located around the base of the nozzle.

"
What are the two main classifications of annular nozzles based on gas flow characteristics?,"A central body, also called a plug, keeps the gas flow away from a central portion of the nozzle. There are two principal types of annular nozzles. They are the radial in-flow type (spike nozzle) and the radial out-flow type. The latter type, in turn, includes expansion-deflection or E-D, reverse-flow or R-F, and horizontal-flow or H-F nozzles. The nozzles shown above have, all of them, the same level of thrust, the same expansion area ratio, and the same theoretical thrust coefficient Cr (see Chap. "
What is the definition of the expansion area ratio for an annular nozzle in relation to the throat area?,"1, Sect. 1.3). Annular nozzles are shorter than conical or bell-shaped nozzles, and are therefore advantageous over the latter in terms of length and mass of the whole vehicle.  For an annular nozzle, the expansion area ratio ¢ is defined as the ratio of the projected area of the contoured nozzle wall to the area of the throat (A,). The projected area of the contoured nozzle wall, in turn, is the area of the nozzle at the exit plane (A.) minus the projected area of the central body (A,). Therefore Ae — Ap € = ——_ A;. "
What does the annular diameter ratio assess in relation to nozzle design?,"The preceding figure indicates the values of the annular diameter ratio, D,/D,, where Dy is the diameter of the central body, and D, is the diameter of the throat of an equivalent nozzle having a circular cross section. The value of annular diameter ratio makes it possible to compare an annular nozzle with a conventional (conical or bell-shaped) nozzle."
What characteristic of annular nozzles prevents over-expansion of exhaust gas flow that affects bell or conical nozzles?,"Annular nozzles are not subject to losses which affect nozzles of the bell or conical type. This is because, in nozzles of the latter type, the exhaust gas may expand to pressures which are considerably smaller than the ambient pressure before the gas flow detaches from the nozzle wall. This over-expansion results in thrust losses at high altitudes. The property of annular nozzles which avoids an over-expansion of the exhaust gas flow is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5], for an E-D (expansion-deflection) nozzle.. "

How does the pressure at the back face of the nozzle relate to the ambient pressure at different altitudes?,"This figure illustrates an E-D nozzle operating at low altitudes (left) and at high altitudes (right). In this figure, p, indicates the pressure at the back face of the central body of the nozzle. The value of p, depends on the value of the ambient pressure Po, and is usually smaller than that of po. The point C indicates the shoulder of the central body. The dashed line CD is a line of constant Mach number. "
What factors influence the flow characteristics of gas downstream from point D in a nozzle?,"Downstream of the throat, the exhaust gas expands unaffected around the shoulder C of the central body as long as its pressure at the wall is greater than p,. After the gas expands from the throat to the point D along the line CD, the flow downstream of D depends on the nozzle contour DE, and also on the pressure p,, whose value affects the free stream surface of the boundary of the inner jet. The gas flow is deflected by the contour of the curved wall, and therefore is subject to compression, which increases the pressure at the wall. "
What happens to exhaust gas behavior at low altitudes in relation to wall pressure and nozzle shape?,"This increase in wall pressure at low altitudes is shown on the left-hand  side of the preceding figure. At such altitudes, the exhaust gas remains attached to the wall, as is the case with a conical or bell-shaped nozzle.. "
What happens to gas flow at high altitudes when the pressure decreases significantly?,"By contrast, at high altitudes, the value of p, becomes so low, that the gas flow deviates towards the central body. This deviation is shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure. In such conditions, a shock wave may occur, or the gas flow may continue unaffected up to the exit plane of the nozzle, depending on the flow conditions. This decrease in wall pressure at high altitudes is shown on the right-hand side of the same figure.. "
What type of nozzle is characterized by a radial inward component of velocity and shows improved specific impulse when compared to a bell nozzle?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [36], illustrates a plug (or truncated aerodynamic spike) nozzle, which is an annular nozzle discharging exhaust gas having a radial inward component of velocity. This figure also shows the better performance of this aerospike nozzle in comparison with a bell nozzle in terms of specific impulse."

What is the primary benefit of an aerospike nozzle compared to a traditional bell-shaped nozzle in terms of altitude performance?,"The advantage of the aerospike nozzle over the bell-shaped nozzle resides in its ability to adjust with altitude changes to the static pressure of the free stream. This results in a higher specific impulse than that of a bell-shaped nozzle at low altitudes, as shown in the preceding figure. This altitude compensation is due to the shape of the aerospike nozzle, which has a central ramp terminating either in a plug base or in a spike in the centre, and is open to the atmosphere on the sides.. "
What is the primary structure at the end of an aerospike nozzle that provides a terminating surface for the central ramp?,"An aerospike nozzle having a central ramp terminating in a plug base is shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of NASA [36].  £ Ae ce oid \ R nn he "" | oo ~"
How does the exhaust gas behave in relation to ambient static pressure when altitude increases?,"The central spike need not be a solid wall, because it can be aerodynamically formed by injecting gases from the engine base, as will be shown below. The exhaust gas is free to expand on the open sides of the nozzle, and to adjust its static pressure with the static pressure of the ambient, which decreases with altitude. Thus, a nozzle of very high area ratio (of high performance in vacuo) can also operate efficiently and safely at sea level.. "
What type of nozzle is designed for optimal efficiency at a specific altitude to achieve maximum thrust through ideal gas expansion?,"By contrast, a bell-shaped nozzle can be designed to be optimum (that is, to operate at its maximum level of efficiency) at only one altitude. By maximum level of efficiency, we mean the optimal expansion of the combusted gas, which results in the maximum thrust. For example, the initial stage of the Saturn rocket, which carried the Apollo astronauts to the Moon, had a narrow bell-shaped nozzle to produce an ideal straight-edged column of exhaust gas at sea level. "
What type of nozzle was designed for optimal gas expansion in a vacuum environment during lunar orbit?,"However, the command module, which orbited around the Moon, had a much wider bell-shaped nozzle, which was better suited than the nozzle of the initial stage to the expansion of the combusted gas in the vacuum of space.. "
What term in the thrust equation becomes zero when the static pressure of exhaust gases equals the static pressure of the surrounding environment?,"As shown above, in an aerospike nozzle, the static pressure (p,) of the exhaust gas is the same as the static pressure (po) of the ambient, and therefore the term A.(p. — Po) in the equation of thrust (see Chap. 1, Sect. 1.1):"
What is the purpose of individual thruster segments in an aerospike engine design?,"F = myve + Ac(Pe — Po) reduces to zero. In addition, an aerospike engine may also be made of individual thruster segments, which can be turned on or off to provide thrust vector control in order to steer the vehicle [37], instead of using one of the techniques described in Sect. 2.2."
What type of nozzle design was utilized in the thrust chamber of the aerospike engine developed by Rockwell Aerospace in the 1960s?,"An aerospike rocket engine was developed by Rockwell Aerospace/Rocketdyne Division of Canoga Park, California. In the 1960s, Rocketdyne developed a rounded aerospike engine, whose thrust chamber consisted of a truncated annular spike nozzle, of the radial in-flow type, and a number of discrete combustion chambers arranged around the periphery of the nozzle, so as to discharge their gases along the surface of the nozzle. "
What type of engine design discharges gases along the surface of a rectangular wedge instead of utilizing a traditional round shape?,"Subsequently, in 1972, this design gave rise to a linear aerospike engine,  where the gases are discharged along the surface of a rectangular wedge rather than around a round spike-shape. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [38], illustrates (left) a normal rocket engine having a bell-shaped nozzle, and (right) the linear aerospike rocket engine designed for the Lockheed-Martin X-33 wing-shaped vehicle, which was a technology demonstrator (cancelled on the 1st of March 2001) for NASA’s “next-generation” of space launch vehicles [39]. Normal Bell-Nozzle Linear Aerospike Rocket Engine Rocket Engine. "
What factors influence the effectiveness of an aerospike nozzle during its operation?,"The performance of an aerospike nozzle depends on various factors, such as the shape of the nozzle, the amount of the secondary flow (about 1% of the primary flow), the manner of introducing the secondary flow, and the energy ratio of the secondary flow to the primary."
What is the operating mechanism of an aerospike nozzle under high altitude conditions concerning pressure ratios?,"The working principle of an aerospike nozzle can be explained as follows. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5], illustrates the gas flow, under altitude conditions (that is, high value of the pressure ratio p,/po), of a rocket engine having a toroidal combustion chamber, an annular throat, and a truncated spike nozzle ending in a circular base.

What effect does adding secondary flow to the recirculating flow at the base of the nozzle have on pressure and thrust?,"The primary flow of the exhaust gas expands along the wall of the nozzle, in the Region | of the preceding figure, and generates thrust. The primary flow continues to expand beyond the base of the nozzle, and gives rise to a subsonic recirculating flow in the Region 2 of the same figure. The pressure acting on the base generates additional thrust. By adding a small amount of secondary flow to the recirculating flow at the base of the nuzzle, the pressure acting on the base is increased further. "
What factor influences the optimum amount of secondary flow added for different nozzle shapes?,"There is a limit to this increase in efficiency, which determines the optimum amount of secondary flow to be added for each given shape of the nozzle. The outer surface of the primary flow is the boundary of a free stream, and therefore depends on the ambient pressure. This fact provides the property of altitude compensation to the aerospike nozzle illustrated above.. "
What relationship is illustrated by the graph of thrust coefficient in nozzles compared to the pressure ratio of combustion chamber static pressure to ambient pressure?,"The performance of the gas expansion in nozzles of various types can be expressed by means of a graph of the thrust coefficient Cr (defined in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.3) versus the pressure ratio p,/po of the static pressure in the combustion chamber p, to the ambient pressure po. In the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5], we consider the thrust coefficient Cr for: (a) an ideal nozzle of variable expansion area ratio having the optimum expansion for any value of the pressure ratio p,/po, (b) an aerospike nozzle of high area ratio, and (c) a bell-shaped nozzle of high area ratio.

By contrast, a rocket engine fed by pressurised gas is limited by a low amount of pressure, and therefore works at a low pressure in the combustion chamber. In the latter case, film, ablative, or radiation cooling methods are to be used.. "

What factors might cause the calculated convective heat transfer coefficient to be lower than the actual value on the hot gas side?,"The preceding equations give approximate values of the convective heat transfer coefficient h, on the hot gas side. The calculated value of h, may be lower than the real value, because a substantial part of combusted gases may transfer heat through radiation, or because a substantial part of gaseous molecules dissociate and then recombine near the wall of the thrust chamber, or because the gas flow is unstable. "
What factors can lead to the calculated value of h being greater than the actual value in a combustion process?,"Conversely, the calculated value of h, may be higher than the real value, because the chemical reactions occurring in the combustion process may be incomplete in the combustion chamber, or because the combusted gases may deposit solid particles, which in turn create insulating layers on the wall of the chamber. These solid particles are made of carbon, in case of a combination of liquid oxygen with RP-1 (kerosene). This carbon layer increases the thermal insulation of the wall on the hot gas side.. "

"
What is the temperature range on the hot gas side of the combustion chamber wall?,"The coolant increases its temperature from its point of entry into to its point of exit from the cooling channel, depending on the heat absorbed and its rate of flow. The metals commonly used for the walls of combustion chambers are stainless steel,  nickel, and Inconel®, the last of them being a high-performance austenitic nickel- chromium-based alloy. According to Huzel and Huang [5], the temperature of the wall on the hot gas side is about 1089-1255 K, and the difference of temperature between the combusted gas and the wall ranges from 1644 to 3589 K. "
What factors influence the overall heat transfer coefficient in a multi-layer system?,"The equations written above show that the heat flux g is the same for the three layers and depends on the temperatures and on the overall heat transfer coefficient H. The value of H, in turn, depends on the individual heat transfer coefficients relating to the boundary layers and to the wall.. "
What does a small value of H indicate about the relationship between g and H according to design objectives?,"Since g = H(Tay — Teo), then a small value of H implies a small value of g. It is a primary objective for a designer to keep the value of hg. lower than the values of h, and t/k. By so doing, there will be a higher temperature drop Tay — Tyg in the boundary layer on the hot gas side, as shown in the preceding figure, than the temperature drops (T\,, — T,,- and T,,- — T¢,) im, respectively, the wall and the boundary layer on the coolant side.. "
"What factors influence the heat transfer coefficient on the coolant side, specifically regarding chemical reactions and the conditions for boiling?","The value of the heat transfer coefficient 4, on the coolant side depends on several factors, such as possible chemical reactions of dissociation occurring in the coolant, its pressure, and its bulk temperature. It also depends on a possible formation of bubbles due to a coolant boiling near the wall. In order to achieve a good heat- absorbing capacity of the coolant, the pressure and the velocity of the coolant in its flow are selected so that a boiling is permitted locally, but the bulk of the coolant does not reach the boiling condition [2]. "
What factor determines which equation to use for the relationship between wall temperature and heat flux in transitional or turbulent flow conditions?,"In the absence of boiling, at subcritical temperatures, and in transitional or turbulent regime (in the interval 3000 < Re < 10°), the relation between the wall temperature and the heat flux, which depends on the heat transfer coefficient h,, can be expressed approximately by using one of the following three equations due to Taler [52, page 4, Eqs. 18, 19, and 20].

What happens to the heat transfer coefficient of the vapour-film boundary layer if the coolant's bulk temperature exceeds the critical limit?,"As mentioned above, the bulk temperature of the coolant should be kept below the critical value, because the value of the heat transfer coefficient of the vapour-film boundary layer would be too low to cool effectively the wall."

The allowed value of the total heat transfer rate Q (W) from the hot gas to the wall must be less than the  cooling capacity Q, (that is, Q < Q,) of the coolant by a margin imposed by safety. "
What factors must be considered in designing the coolant passage cross-section for maintaining appropriate coolant velocities in a thrust chamber?,"This limitation does not affect hydrogen when used as a coolant fluid, because of its high transfer coefficient even in supercritical conditions of pressure and temperature. Hydrogen enters the coolant passage of the thrust chamber at supercritical pressure and reaches its supercritical temperature at a short distance from the inlet section. The cross-section areas of the coolant passage at various points along the wall of the thrust chamber must be designed to maintain the coolant velocity imposed by the heat transfer coefficient determined by the calculation. "
What are the two types of cooling jacket designs based on engine thrust specifications mentioned in the context?,"Possible design choices for the cooling jacket include longitudinal tubes (for engines whose thrust is equal to or greater than 13,400 N) and coaxial shells separated by helical ribs or wires (for engines of smaller thrust). In the latter case, the coolant passage is the rectangular area limited by the inner shell, the outer shell, and two adjacent ribs. The ribs are wrapped helically around the inner shell.. "
What factors influence the number of coolant tubes in a tubular thrust chamber?,"Incase of thrust chambers of tubular shape, such as those described in Sect. 2.4, the number of tubes for the coolant fluid depends on factors such as the size of the thrust chamber, the mass flow rate of the coolant for unit area of the tubes, the maximum allowable stress for the material of which the tubes are made, and manufacturing considerations. The region of a thrust chamber which needs the maximum cooling is the throat, because there the heat flux q is also maximum. "
What factors influence the quantity of cooling tubes needed for a specific coolant flow rate?,"Therefore, the cooling requirements at the throat determine the number of cooling tubes for a given flow rate of the coolant used. The cross section of the cooling tubes is often circular, for easiness of manufacturing and lower stress. The mechanical and thermal stresses acting on the cooling tubes are induced by the pressure exerted by the coolant, and by the difference of temperature between the tubes and the wall. "
What factors contribute to the distortion of stresses in adjacent tubes in a thrust chamber?,"In addition, since two adjacent tubes may be subject to different pressures, then distorting stresses may also arise.

"
What causes the bending moment per unit length in circular cross-section tubes when discontinuity is present?,"In case of tubes of circular cross section, the bending moment per unit length M4 is caused only by discontinuity, because there is no effect of difference of pressure between adjacent tubes [5].. "
What condition leads to thermal inelastic buckling occurring in the longitudinal direction of a cooling tube?,"With reference to the preceding figure, the mean temperature in the zone I (which is on the side of the combusted gas) of each cooling tube is much higher than the mean temperature in the zone II (which is on the side of the outer shell). Therefore, the thermal expansion of the cooling tube in zone | is restrained by the low temperature in zone II. Since the mass in zone II is greater than the mass in zone I, then thermal inelastic buckling can arise in zone I in the longitudinal direction. "
What equations are used to evaluate the thermal stress in the longitudinal direction and critical stress associated with longitudinal inelastic buckling?,The thermal stress o (N/m?) in the longitudinal direction and the critical stress 0. (N/m?) relating to the longitudinal inelastic buckling may be evaluated by using the following equations [5]:.

The thermal stress o should not be higher than 0.90,. The preceding figure also shows, on the right-hand side, cooling tubes of elongated cross section. "
What factors influence the calculation of the bending moment per unit length at section A-A in tube systems?,"The equations written above can also be applied for the purpose of computing the stresses in such tubes. The maximum combined stress acts in the section A-A.

These channels are bonded together to make up the chamber and bound by stainless steel wire wrapping which is brazed to make a fluid-tight and strong outer skin. In a thrust chamber of this type, the outer skin (the brazed wire) is  subject only to the hoop stress due to the pressure exerted by the coolant. "
What factors contribute to the mechanical stress experienced by an inner shell in a thermal system?,"The inner shell is subject to the mechanical stress is due to the difference of pressure existing between the combusted gas and the coolant, and also to the thermal stress due to the heat transfer across the wall..

"What factors contribute to minimizing the pressure drop of a coolant fluid in a tube, according to the principles of fluid dynamics?","Since the heat transfer in a rocket engine occurs mainly through convection, it is desirable to reduce the pressure drop of the coolant fluid to the minimum possible value. For this purpose, it is necessary to avoid abrupt changes in the direction of the coolant fluid and also in the hydraulic diameter of the tubes. In addition, the inner surfaces of these tubes should be smooth and clean. The pressure drop Ap (N/m?) in a tube of length L (m) and hydraulic diameter d (m) is expressed as a function of the Darcy friction factor fp (dimensionless) of the tube by means of the Darcy-Weisbach equation, as follows. "
What factors influence the Darcy friction factor in a fluid flow system?,L{1_ 4 Ap = fo 7 (Sor ) where p (kg/m?) and v are respectively the density and the average velocity of the coolant flowing in the tube. The Darcy friction factor fp depends on the Reynolds number Re defined above and also on the shape and smoothness of the tubes.
What is the relationship between the friction factor and Reynolds number in laminar flow conditions?,"The value of fp is determined experimentally. In practice, in laminar flow regime (Re < 2300), fp = 64/Re. In transitional flow regime (2300 < Re < 4000), there are large uncertainties as to the value of fp.

This type of pass is used with coolants (such as liquid hydrogen) which must previously be heated in order to become effec- tive, that is, in order to absorb the high heat fluxes at the throat. "
How is the number of cooling tubes influenced by the trade-off between thermal and gimbaling factors?,"The extent of the partial pass results from a trade-off between thermal and gimballing requirements, since it is desirable to keep the inlet manifold forward [45].

What manufacturing process is employed by Volvo Aero Corporation for joining cooling tubes to the inner wall of a nozzle?,"The cooling tubes are brazed to each other and to a metal shell or to hatbands for stiffening. To this end, furnace brazing is usually applied. In order to avoid the necessity of tapering, Volvo Aero Corporation has used tubes of square cross-section, which are wrapped in a spiral pattern around the inner wall of the nozzle. They are joined by gas-tungsten arc fillet welds [63]. Volvo Aero Corporation has also used a manufacturing process which consists in laser welding a close-out cover sheet on to an inner wall with milled cooling channels. "
What shape does the component take after the outer sheet joins with the inner sheet through laser welding?,"When the outer sheet is laser welded to the inner sheet, the part has the form of a straight cone. Successively, the forming of a bell-shaped contour is done by expansion in a conventional expander [64].. "
What distinguishes dump cooling from regenerative cooling in terms of coolant flow and discharge in thrust chamber designs?,"As has been shown above, the dump cooling method is similar to the regenerative cooling, because the coolant flows, for both of these methods, through small passages on the outer side of the thrust chamber. However, in the case of dump cooling, the coolant is discharged overboard through openings at the end plane of the divergent portion of the nozzle, instead of flowing back to be discharged into the injector. "
What is the significance of low pressure hydrogen in rocket engine thrust production and cooling methods?,"This method is used in rocket engines fuelled by hydrogen at low pressures (p,. < 689500 N/m, where Pc is the static absolute pressure in the combustion chamber). The heated hydrogen dumped overboard gives a contribution to the total thrust. The coolant, if flowing longitudinally from the injector plane to the exit plane, can pass either in the interstice between a double wall (case A) or in tubes running along a single wall (case C). "
In what configurations can coolant flow from the injector plane to the exit plane before being discharged?,"The coolant, if flowing spirally from the injector plane to the exit plane, can pass either in spiral passages existing between a double wall (case B) or in tubes wound around a single wall (case D), before being dumped overboard in the axial direction.

YJ Coolant flow mn \ N Dy iS Ay ¥ YA | fi D yee) “PS Zirconium oxide y Chamber €. "
What is the purpose of injecting additional coolant downstream in a cooling system?,"Due to phenomena of heat and mass transfer between the coolant film and the combusted gas, the thickness of the coolant film decreases in the direction of the hot stream. Therefore, in case of need, further coolant is injected through additional holes placed downstream of those placed along the first row. Film cooling is sometimes used in conjunction with regenerative cooling, for the purpose of reducing the heat transfer through the wall and, therefore, the thermal stress of the materials.. "
What factors affect the efficiency of heat absorption during the injection of a coolant in a combustion chamber?,"The coolant is often in the liquid state at the moment of injection, in order to absorb heat from the combusted gas by evaporating and diffusing into the main stream. This injection gives rise to a liquid film placed around the wall of the combustion chamber and containing the gaseous stream. The cooling efficiency of the injected fuel is subject to losses, due to disturbance waves on the surface of the liquid film adjacent to the combusted gas.. "

"What is the range of values for the coefficient N- that accounts for losses, and how are these values determined?","The losses mentioned above can be taken into account by means of the coefficient N-, whose values range from 0.3 to 0.7 [5]. These values are to be determined exper- imentally. Hydrocarbon fuels have proven to be effective when used as coolants, because of the heat insulation properties of the carbon deposits generated by them on the walls of a thrust chamber."
"What phenomenon occurs due to the low critical temperature of hydrogen, affecting the behavior of liquid hydrogen used as a fuel?","When liquid hydrogen is used as a fuel, the very low critical temperature of hydrogen (T, = 33.18 K, according to [62]) causes the initially liquid film to evaporate at a short distance from the point of injection."
What equation is recommended for designing a thrust chamber that utilizes gaseous film cooling according to Hatch and Papell?,Hatch and Papell [67] indicate the following equation to be used for the design a thrust chamber cooled by a gaseous film:

"
What factors influence the heat transfer from the wall of a combustion chamber to the coolant in a heat exchange system?,"The Hatch-Papell equation written above is based on the assumption of a balance between the heat coming from the wall of the combustion chamber and the heat absorbed by the coolant. The heat coming from the wall depends on the heat transfer hg coefficient on the hot gas side and also on the difference between the temperature T ay Of the gas at the adiabatic wall and the initial temperature T., of the coolant. "
What factors influence the heat absorption of a coolant in relation to its temperature change along a specific flow path?,"The heat absorbed by the coolant depends on the heat capacity of the coolant in the interval from the initial temperature to the final temperature. When the two amounts of heat are in equilibrium, no heat is transferred through the wall. In such conditions, the inner surface of the thrust chamber reaches the temperature of the coolant corresponding to the particular location along the flow axis. Therefore, the temperature of the inner surface of the thrust chamber increases from the initial temperature of the coolant at the point of injection to the maximum allowable value of the temperature, at which point a further injection of coolant becomes necessary.. "
Calculate the mass flow rate of film coolant required per unit area of the thrust chamber wall using the given temperature and heat transfer coefficient.,"As an example of application, it is required to determine the mass flow rate G, (kg s~! m7) of film coolant per unit area of the wall of the thrust chamber to be cooled, for a rocket engine burning a combination of liquid hydrogen (fuel) with liquid fluorine (oxidiser). At the throat plane, the following quantities are known: heat transfer coefficient on the hot gas side hg = 3238 W m~?

What must be determined experimentally to compute the heat flux in a regeneratively cooled engine with film cooling?,"When the heat flux g (W/m7), that is, the quantity of heat transferred per unit time per unit surface, is computed for a regeneratively cooled engine with added film cooling, then it is necessary to modify the value of the temperature T,,, (K) of the adiabatic wall, before using this value in the equation g = hg(Taw-Twe) or in the equation ¢ = hgc(Tay—T we). The modified value of T,,, must be determined experimentally. By contrast, it is not necessary to modify the value of the heat transfer coefficient hy or ge (W m7? K~!) on the hot gas side.. "
How does the structure of the wall aid in preventing heat transfer from combusted gas during transpiration cooling?,"As has been shown at the beginning of this paragraph, in case of transpiration cooling, the wall to be cooled has drilled holes or is made of a porous material, in order for the coolant to pass through the wall into the gas flow. A protective layer builds up on the hot gas side of the wall and insulates it from the heat carried by the stream of combusted gas, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [69]..

What effect does the counterflow generated between the coolant and combusted gas have on heat transfer efficiency in a thermal system?,"Since the coolant is directed away from the surface when leaving the wall, then a counterflow is generated between the heat carried away from the surface with the coolant stream and the heat transferred from the stream of combusted gas toward the wall. This counterflow reduces the overall heat transfer between the hot gas and the surface of the wall [69]. The permeable inner liner of the thrust chamber is enclosed into an outer shell, and forms a jacket from which the coolant comes. . "

"
What is the cooling efficiency value recommended by Huzel and Huang for transpiration-cooled thrust chambers?,"Since the Rannie equation written above indicates coolant flows slightly lower than those found necessary in experiments, then Huzel and Huang [5] recommend to use a cooling efficiency value of about 0.85. The porous material used for the walls of transpiration-cooled thrust chambers must, of course, withstand the mechanical and thermal stresses acting on such walls."
"What process involves using a protective substance that thermally decomposes, producing a solid residue while releasing gases?","As has been shown above, ablative cooling is performed by using a protective material which covers the inner surface of a wall to be cooled. This material is made of either epoxy or, more often, phenolic resins reinforced by fibres.

It is also necessary to maintain a mixture of propellants rich in fuel at the moment of shutting the engine off, in order to avoid overheating. "
What components can be utilized to mitigate the spread of local detonations resulting from combustion instabilities?,"The prop- agation of local detonations due to combustion instabilities can be prevented by using damping devices placed either on the injector face (baffles) or along the wall of the combustion chamber (acoustic liners).

How is the resultant angle characterized regarding the direction of the stream after an impact in relation to the thrust chamber?,"The resultant angle f is defined in such a way as to be positive when the resulting stream after the impact is directed toward the chamber wall, and negative when the stream is directed toward the axis of symmetry of the thrust chamber."
What is the beneficial range of the 6 angle in radians for mixing liquid propellants in an engine burning hypergolic substances?,"Incase of an engine burning a combination of hypergolic propellants, a small posi- tive value (ranging from 0.03491 rad to 0.08727 rad) of the 6 angle is advantageous for the purpose of mixing the liquid propellants along the wall of the combustion chamber."
What is the implication of a positive value of the 8 angle in relation to hot streak formation in combustion chambers?,"Incase of an engine burning a combination of cryogenic propellants, their mixing occurs principally in the gaseous state. In these conditions, a positive value of the 8 angle can generate hot streaks on the wall of the combustion chamber. A negative value of the B angle should be chosen to avoid this undesirable effect."
What is the definition of injection momentum ratio?,"Another factor is the injection momentum ratio, which is defined as follows"
What is the range of the injection momentum ratio for liquid hydrogen injection according to Huzel and Huang?,"mo mt py y where m,(kg/s) and m (kg/s) are the mass flow rates of respectively the oxidiser and the fuel, and v, (m/s) and vy (m/s) are their respective injection velocities. The injection momentum ratio is an index of performance. For the design of oxygen- hydrogen injectors, Huzel and Huang [5] indicate the following values of injection  momentum ratio: 1.5 < R,, < 3.5 when liquid hydrogen is injected, and 0.5 < Ry», < 0.9 when gaseous hydrogen id injected.. "
What is the relationship between the pressure behind the injector face and the drop in injection pressure in steady-state conditions?,"Still another factor is the structural load, which is due to the pressures (measured in N/m”) exerted by the propellants behind the face of the injector (py) and in the injector manifolds (p,,).In the steady state, the pressure py behind the face of the injector is equal to the drop of injection pressure Ap;, defined above, as follows"
How is the pressure in the injector manifolds determined in relation to the combustion chamber and injection pressure drop?,"The pressure p,, in the injector manifolds results from summing the pressure (p-.)j of the combustion chamber at the injector end to the drop Ap; of injection pressure, as follows"
What empirical formula can be used to estimate the pressure load of the propellant when the valves are opened rapidly?,"At the start of the engine, the pressure behind the face of the injector may be much greater than the corresponding pressure in the steady state. When the valves of the propellants are opened rapidly, the pressure of the propellant can cause a hydraulic ram. Let p, (N/m?) be the pressure of the propellant at the moment of opening the valves. Huzel and Huang [5] indicate the following empirical formula to estimate the pressure load:. "
What parameters are necessary to calculate the injector orifice sizes for two propellants in a rocket engine?,"As an example of application, it is required to determine the size of the orifices of the injector for the two propellants, the injection velocity, and the injection momentum ratio for a rocket engine of given properties."
What is the mass flow rate in kg/s of the oxidiser used in the rocket engine?,"Let us consider again the rocket engine described in Sects. 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5. This engine burns a combination of liquid oxygen (oxidiser) with RP-1 (fuel). The density of the oxidiser is py = 1141 kg/m? and its mass flow rate in the thrust chamber is My = 880.4 kg/s. The density of the fuel is py = 808.1 kg/m? and its mass flow rate in the thrust chamber is 1 = 375.1 kg/s. The drop of injection pressure is Apj = 1.379 x 10° N/m? for both of the propellants. A coefficient of discharge Cg = 0.75 is taken for both of them.. "
What is the calculated total area for the oxidiser orifices in the injector according to the given equations?,"The total area A, of the orifices for the oxidiser in the injector results from the following equationAy = (tite) 2p. \AcCi which, solved for Ag, yields  No 880.4 Ay = ——e = = 0.02093 mr?

What type of injector can be utilized for liquid/liquid injection where pairs of jets collide?,"In the present case (liquid/liquid injection), an injector of the like-doublet type can be used, in which oxidiser and fuel jets are made to impinge in pairs, as has been shown above."
What is the area of each orifice for the oxidiser when utilizing 700 doublets?,"In case of using 700 doublets for the oxidiser and 700 doublets for the fuel, the area of each orifice for the oxidiser is"
Calculate the diameter for an orifice if the area is 7.564 x 10-6 m² and use the equation d = √(4A/π).,"Ac 0.02093 dy = ——— = ——_ = 0.1495 x 10-4 m? = 0.1495 cm? 2 x 700 1400 Hence, the diameter of each orifice for the oxidiser is 1 1 4a, \? 4 x 0.1495 x 10-4)? d,= (2) = (22? *""  ) = 0.004362 m = 4.362 mm ba 3.1416 Likewise, the area of each orifice for the fuel is A 0.0105 ap=—L_= 0.01059 _ 7.564 x 10-6 m? 2 x 700 1400 Hence, the diameter of each orifice for the fuel is 1 \ 4 z 4 x 7.564 x 10-6)? dp = (Al) = (AXP) = 0.003103 m = 3.103 mm ba 3.1416 The mean velocities of injection for respectively the oxidiser (v,) and the fuel (vy) result from the following equation m v= — Ap For the oxidiser, we find mM 880.4 = 36.87 m/ *o = Typ, 0.02093 x 1141S For the fuel, we find  my 375.1 43.83 m/ = SE .

What is the function of a gas generator in a liquid-propellant rocket engine?,"‘Ss fap, 0.01059 x 808.1 The injection momentum ratio results from pV 880.4 x 36.87 Ry = eke, = SK OPT = 1.974 mypvp 375.1 x 43.83 2.7 Gas-generator and Other Engine Cycles A gas generator is the part of a liquid-propellant rocket engine which supplies energy to drive the turbo-pumps. A turbo-pump is a rotating machine which takes one of the liquid propellants at low pressure from a tank and supplies it to the combustion chamber at the required mass flow rate and injection pressure. "
What term describes the various configurations of components used to utilize propellants in rocket engines?,"The energy absorbed by the turbine is provided by the expansion of compressed gases, which are usually mixtures of the propellants burned in the engine [79]. There are several ways to use the propellants for this purpose. Therefore, there are several arrangements of components, which are called rocket engine cycles. Some of these cycles are briefly described below. The gas-generator cycle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [80]. "
What are the main components of a gas generator in a bipropellant gas-generator cycle?,"I f\ oO | Gry ‘ e \ \ \ \ . + Bipropellant Monoprope! lant gas generator gas generator In the bi-propellant gas-generator cycle (left), the working fluid for the turbine (T) is derived by combustion of the oxidiser (O) with the fuel (F) in the gas generator (GG) at a temperature below the turbine temperature limits. A gas generator consists of a propellant valve, an injector, and a combustion chamber. "
What is the maximum operating temperature for the turbine materials used in the gas generator system?,"The propellants for the gas generator are tapped from the turbo-pump discharge lines, injected into the combustor through the gas-generator injector, burned, and converted to gas. This gas is expanded through the turbine which drives the pumps. Since the operating temperature limit of  the current turbine materials is about 1090 K, the gas generator is operated with excess fuel, in order for the temperature to remain within this limit. "
What percentage of the propellants in the J-2X engine is utilized to maintain engine operation?,"A small amount (about 3% in the J-2X engine) of the propellants is used to keep the engine running, whereas the remaining part of the propellants is used to generate thrust. A gas generator (GG) is a separate, small combustion chamber which produces gases. These gases are used to drive the turbines connected to the pumps. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [81], shows a scheme of the J-2X engine, which is based on the gas-generator cycle. "
What are the propellants commonly used in rocket engines that employ both liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen?,"This engine uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as, respectively, fuel and oxidiser (OXID). FUEL oxi0 4 id ¢ ow _ ———} — mov — —a nex. "
What components are responsible for increasing the pressure of liquid propellants before they enter the main engine?,"These propellants go immediately from their tanks into their turbo-pumps, which are the fuel turbo-pump (FTP) and the oxidiser turbo-pump (OTP). There, the mechanical energy of the rotating pumps is used to put the liquid propellants under pressure. At the exit from the pumps, a small amount of each propellant is tapped off to supply the gas generator (GG), which is substantially a small engine included into the principal engine. "
What are the two types of turbines that are driven by the hot gases generated by the small engine?,"This small engine generates hot combustion products (which are, in the present case, steam and gaseous hydrogen) at high pressure. These gases are used to drive first the turbine connected to the fuel pump and then the turbine connected to the oxidiser pump. After driving the two turbines, the hot gases are used to warm the helium flowing through the heat exchanger (HEX), which is used to pressurise the oxygen tank of the stage, and are then dumped along the walls of the nozzle extension, to keep them cool. "
What is the purpose of the small portion of warm gaseous hydrogen that is diverted before entering the main injector?,"The remaining liquid oxygen, which does not go to the gas generator, is directed to the main injector. The hydrogen coming from the fuel pump is used to regeneratively cool the walls of the nozzle and the walls of the main combustion chamber (MCC), and is then directed to the injector of the main combustion chamber. A very small amount of the warm gaseous hydrogen is tapped off before entering the main injector, and is routed back to pressurise the hydrogen tank, as is the case with the helium flowing through the heat exchanger  on the oxygen side. "
What is the primary trade-off associated with the simple engine cycle regarding exhaust gas effectiveness compared to controlled acceleration through a nozzle?,"The exhaust gases coming from the turbines are dumped along the nozzle extension. These gases generate some thrust, but not as efficiently as the gases which are accelerated by flowing through the throat and the nozzle. The loss of effectiveness is the price paid for this simple engine cycle. On the other hand, the turbines of an engine using a gas-generator cycle are not subject to counter-pressures which would arise if the exhaust gases where injected into the combustion chamber. "
What components are utilized to manage engine operations during startup and shutdown periods in the described system?,"This fact makes it easy to design the turbines and the pipes. The other items shown in the preceding scheme are the main fuel valve (MFV), the main oxidiser valve (MOV), the gas-generator fuel valve (GGFV), and the gas-generator oxidiser valve (GGOV). These and other minor valves are used to control the engine during the start and shutdown transients [81]. The gas-generator cycle is used in the Vulcain, HM7B, Merlin, RS-68, RS-27A, J-2X, J-2, F-1, RD-107, and CE-20 engines.. "
What specific feature of the thrust chamber tap-off cycle allows for the turbine's working fluid to be extracted from a cooler gas location?,"The thrust chamber tap-off cycle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [80].In the tap-off cycle, the working fluid for the turbine is tapped off near the face of the injector at a location in which a sufficiently cool gas is available [82]. The thrust chamber tap-off cycle is used in the J-2S engine."
What type of cycle is utilized in engines such as the RL10 and Vinci?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [80], shows the expander cycle, which is used in the RL10, Vinci, RD-0146, YF-75D, LE-5A/5B (expander bleed cycle), LE-9, and MB-60 engines.  an, i « SN / \"
What is the process called where hydrogen is evaporated and heated in a thrust chamber jacket to power turbines?,"In the expander cycle, also called hot-fuel tap-off cycle, hydrogen (F) is evaporated and heated in the jacket of the thrust chamber, and is then used to drive the turbines. The exhaust gas coming from the turbines is fed to the combustion chamber [82].The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [80], shows the staged- combustion cycle."
What role does the hot gas from the pre-burner play in the staged-combustion cycle?,"In the staged-combustion cycle, most of the fuel (F), except a small quantity used as coolant, and a small amount of the oxidiser (O) are pre-burned in a pre-burner (P) at an extremely fuel-rich mixture. The resulting fuel-rich hot gas is used to drive the turbo-pump turbine, and is then injected into the main combustion chamber together with the remaining oxidiser and the coolant fuel, where all of them are finally burned.. "
What engines are highlighted for utilizing the staged-combustion cycle in the provided illustration?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [50], shows the staged-combustion cycle, used in the RS-25 engine (which is the main engine of the Space Shuttle) and in the RS-170/180 engine.  “ i 4esiiin i a ; EX » Oxidizer DIR appeal ” r/ Gs ‘ fel Pui lide — B ¥ —_— & | v ‘ a x - SG DAS: SW a TENA f I —— = kins Main High-Pressure teal ~ High-Pressure J Leas 2 coreeba Oxidizer Turbopump. "
What is the usual gas temperature generated by solid-propellant gas generators that affects the suitability for prolonged use in non-cooled components?,"Liquid-propellant rocket engines may also use solid-propellant gas generators for turbine spinners at the engine start or for other applications of brief duration. This is because the temperature of the gases generated by solid-propellant gas generators is usually above 1366 K, which fact makes them unfit for non-cooled components over long times. These gas generators are only used to start, but the pressure and the gas flow should continue after the burnout of the solid propellant and the takeover of the liquid propellants.. "
What type of gas generator is designed for a single-use application in driving turbines during engine initiation?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5] shows one of such devices, which is a disposable solid-propellant gas generator used to drive the turbines at the engine start. This device is a cartridge bolted to a flange at a liquid-propellant gas generator, as will be shown below. This particular cartridge can be used only once."

When the engine is started, the gas is allowed to leave the start tank and impinge on the blades of the turbines which drive the pumps. "
What variables are involved in the equation determining the combustion rate of a solid propellant?,"Solid propellants are mixtures of fuels with oxidisers. Their exposed surfaces burn uniformly at rates depending on the temperature and on the pressure of the combusted gases. According to Huzel and Huang [5], the combustion rate R (m/s) of a given solid propellant can be expressed as follows p. n R=k,{| ——*—_ 6.895 x 10° where k, (m/s) is a constant quantity, which expresses the constant burning rate of a given propellant, at a given initial temperature, and at a pressure of 6.895 x 10° N/m? in the combustion chamber, p, (N/m?) is the pressure in the combustion chamber, and n is a constant quantity, whose value depends on the sensitivity of the burning rate of the propellant to changes of pressure, at a given temperature. "
"How is the mass flow rate through a solid-propellant gas generator computed using the burning area, combustion rate, and propellant density?","The mass flow rate 7,(kg/s) through a solid-propellant gas generator can be calculated by means of the following equation of [5]: Mg = ApRpp  where A, (m7) is the burning area of the propellant, R (m/s) is the combustion rate, and p, (kg/m*) is the density of the propellant.. "
What relationship must the total area of orifices in a solid-propellant gas generator satisfy to maintain a constant mass flow rate?,"In order for the mass flow rate of a solid-propellant gas generator to be constant, the burning area of the propellant must also be constant.The total area A, (m’) of the orifices of a solid-propellant gas generator must be such as to satisfy the following equation of [5]:"
"What is the relationship between pressure, burning area, and a constant quantity in the context of propellant combustion?","A\ »\™= <= ky P. 2( =) where p, (N/m?) is the pressure in the combustion chamber, kz (N/m?) is a constant quantity for a given propellant at a given temperature, A, (m7) is the burning area of the propellant, and n is the constant quantity mentioned above."
What two substances are mentioned as examples of liquid mono-propellants used for gas generation?,"Liquid mono-propellants may also be used to generate gases. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [83], shows two of these gas generators using (left) hydrazine and (right) hydrogen peroxide."

What is the primary advantage of gas generators that utilize mono-propellants in terms of control and complexity?,"Gas generators using mono-propellants are simple and easy to control. They require a separate tank, unless the gas-generating mono-propellant is also used to feed the main engine."
What are the benefits of using the same propellants in both gas generators and rocketry engines?,"Liquid-propellant gas generators are frequently chosen for liquid-propellant rocket engines, because the same propellants are used in the gas generators and in such engines. The liquid-propellant gas generator used in the H-1 rocket engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5]. The H-1 engine was devel- oped by Rocketdyne for use in the S-I and S-IB first stages of respectively the Saturn I and the Saturn I-B rockets, which were used for the NASA Apollo programme. "
What are the components included in the liquid-propellant gas generator of the H-1 engine?,"The propellants used in this engine are liquid oxygen and RP-1 (kerosene). The liquid-propellant gas generator of the H-1 engine produces combusted gases during steady-state operation to drive the two-stage turbine.  The turbine supplies power through a gear reduction train to drive the propellant pumps. The liquid-propellant gas generator of the H-1 engine consists of a gas gener- ator control valve, an injector assembly, a combustor, and two squib-less igniters. "
What initiates the ignition of propellants before entering the liquid-propellant gas generator during the engine start process?,These components are briefly described below. The propellants entering the liquid- propellant gas generator are ignited by a solid-propellant gas generator (SPGG in the following figure) and by the two squib-less igniters during engine start. The hot gases from the solid-propellant gas generator ignite the squib-less igniters before the liquid propellants enter the liquid-propellant gas generator. 
What is the function of the control valve in the liquid-propellant gas generator?,"The igniters burn for 2.5—3 s to ensure the ignition of the liquid propellants. The control valve of the liquid-propellant gas generator is a normally closed valve containing two poppets, which admit the bootstrap propellants into the combustor of the gas generator during engine operation. ACTUATOR PORT YLLYEG Pn © TT Hi Lp TaN eB A ae PN Sy Z aE tien 1 NLT orares SIT NS IN SS buecror ZZ = oe RAZED JOINT Vo Ih ee a St LZ ad KcmrteR a) mL I = No  The combustion pressure in the thrust chamber actuates the control valve by means of a piston, which opens the fuel poppet first. "
What are the cracking pressures for the fuel and oxidiser poppets expressed in Newtons per square meter?,A yoke integral with the piston opens the oxidiser poppet. The cracking pressures relative to the atmosphere are (7.239 + 1.379) x 10° N/m? for the fuel poppet and (13.79 + 1.379) x 10° N/m? for the oxidiser poppet. The fully-open operating pressure relative to the atmosphere is (18.96 + 1.724) x 10° N/m? for the control valve. The bootstrap propellant mass flow rates are 6.133 kg/s for the fuel and 2.091 kg/s for the oxidiser. 
What mechanism prevents fuel and oxidizer leakage into the control valve actuator during operation?,"A bellows assembly enclosing the liquid oxygen poppet stem and the closure spring, and the seals on the actuator piston prevent leakage of fuel and oxidiser into the control valve actuator. A drain line directs any fuel leakage into the valve actuator to the fuel drain manifold, where it is dumped overboard into the engine exhaust stream. The control valve is designed to ensure a fuel-rich cut-off to prevent an excessive increase in temperature in the combustor with consequent turbine burning. The spring pressure closes the control valve at engine cut-off, when the pressure in the thrust chamber decreases.. "
What is the mixture ratio of the oxidiser to fuel in the injector?,"The fuel and the oxidiser from the gas generator control valve enter the injector and flow through passages which provide a uniform mixture ratio o/f = 0.3409. The injector cavity is designed to permit an oxidiser lead into the combustor during start to prevent detonation. From the injector, two fuel streams impinge on a single oxidiser stream. The injector has 44 impingement points. The fuel which enters the combustor through 36 holes around the periphery of the impingements provides film coolant for the injector. "
What gas is used to purge the oxidiser injector during countdown to prevent contamination?,"During countdown, the oxidiser injector of the gas generator receives a purge with ambient gaseous nitrogen to prevent entrance of contaminants from the solid-propellant gas generator into the injector.. "
What is the operating temperature range of the combustor in Kelvin?,"The bootstrap propellants burn in the combustor and exit to the gas turbine. Two squib-less igniters installed in the combustor just below the injector of the gas gener- ator assure propellant ignition during start. The combustor is a welded assembly with flanges for installation of the solid-propellant gas generator and for attachment to the gas turbine. The operating temperature is 920.9 + 264.3 K, and the operating absolute pressure is (4.456 + 0.03378) x 10° N/m?.. "
What is the duration of operation for the igniters after being ignited by the solid-propellant gas generator?,Two squib-less igniters installed in the injector mounting flange on the combustor burn for 2.5—3 s after their ignition by the solid-propellant gas generator. They ensure ignition of fuel and oxidiser if the solid-propellant gas generator should have expired before bootstrap propellant entry into the combustor.
What is the primary function of a gas generator in relation to propellant combustion?,"A gas generator burns the propellants just as the main engine does, the only difference being the capability possessed by the former of varying the mixture ratio olf, whose value is adjusted in order for the combusted gas to have the desired temperature and chemical properties."
What is the maximum design temperature that materials used in turbines for gas generators should not exceed?,"The guidelines for designing a gas generator for a liquid bi-propellant rocket engine are the same as those relating to the thrust chamber of the main engine. When the characteristic length L* is calculated, the volume to be taken into account goes from the injector to the throat of the nozzle of the turbine. Account is also taken of the maximum temperature which the materials of which the turbine is made can withstand. Consequently, the design temperature of the turbine is usually kept under 1255 K [5].  2.8 Igniters. "
What is the primary function of a device that initiates combustion in a rocket engine by releasing energy?,"An igniter is a device which releases energy (usually in form of heat) in a rocket engine, for the purpose of initiating the combustion of the main propellants. This combustion, after initiation, is capable of sustaining itself without the necessity of receiving heat. The source of energy which stimulates an igniter to release heat is either inside (as is the case with a solid propellant) or outside (as is the case with a spark arrangement) the igniter itself. The principal types of igniters used in rocket engines are described below.. "
What term describes the condition of pyrotechnic mixtures that allows stability and non-reactivity until they receive an external stimulus?,"Pyrotechnic igniters are devices containing mixtures of fuels, oxidants, and often other materials. These devices are used in rocket engines (thrust chambers and gas generators) to release energy in form of heat. Pyrotechnic mixtures are in a state of meta-stability, meaning by this term, stability and non-reactivity under some condi- tions, and release of thermal energy originally stored in chemical form after receiving an external stimulus, which is usually given to such mixtures by addition of heat. "
What term describes the required energy for initiating a reaction resulting in thermal energy production?,"The amount of energy required to stimulate this release of heat is called activation energy. The net amount of thermal energy released in a pyrotechnic reaction is called heat of reaction. The heats of reaction for some binary pyrotechnic compositions are given in [84]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [85], shows an electrically-triggered initiator, or squib, used to ignite a rocket engine.. "
Identify the components involved in the given operation related to contact pins and their functions.,"Output , char Contact pins x — EAN Se \\ Zp Body Prime charge Closure"
What is the typical diameter range for the bridge wire in an electric match used as a prime charge?,"The initiator shown in the preceding figure is a body of metal containing a prime charge, an output charge, and two contact pins used as electrodes. The prime charge is the head of an electric match, which contains a short wire (a bridge wire), 0.0127— 0.127 mm in diameter, made of a material (usually nichrome, which is an alloy 80% nickel and 20% chromium, by mass). This wire glows red-hot when a voltage is applied to its ends. "
What materials are commonly used in the pyrotechnic composition surrounding the bridge wire in an electric match?,"The bridge wire is placed between the two electrodes, and is surrounded by a pyrotechnic composition (materials used for this purpose include  lead styphnate, lead azide, diazodinitrophenol, and zirconium-ammonium perchlo- rate) which is sensitive to heat. A scheme of an electric match is shown in the following figure (re-drawn from [86]. Lacquer coating / igh-resistance bridge wire Pyrotechnic composition Non-conductive substrate Copper foil . "
What voltage must be applied to the electrodes to initiate the heating of the bridge wire in a pyrotechnic device?,"Solder Leg wire The pyrotechnic composition specified above may be surrounded by a second, less sensitive composition, which protects the first. The second composition, in turn, is covered by a nitrocellulose lacquer. A scheme of a squib, including an electric match, is shown in the following figure (re-drawn from [86]. Pyrotechnic base charge Electric match assembly Metal casing Sealing plug Leg wires When a small voltage (28 V or less) is applied to the electrodes, the heating of the bridge wire causes the deflagration of the pyrotechnic material in contact with it. "
How does the incorporation of a secondary explosive affect the ignition process of the primary explosive?,"The output charge is also made of pyrotechnic material, as will be shown below. The addition of the output charge to the prime charge greatly magnifies the ignition effect. . "
What type of igniter can only be used once in a rocket engine and cannot facilitate restart?,"The initiator supplies the energy, in form of heat, which is necessary to ignite the propellants. The solid-propellant charge burns with a hot flame within the combustion chamber. The igniter can be designed to fit directly onto the injector. This method of ignition can only be used once. Therefore, a rocket engine having a pyrotechnic igniter cannot be restarted, as has been shown in Sect. 2.1."
What are the most efficient substances used for generating output charges in initiators?,"The most effective materials used for output charges in initiators are metal-oxidant pyrotechnic formulations. Some examples of these formulations are shown in the following table, due to the courtesy of NASA [85]."
What type of igniters can be installed as plugs in recesses for gas generators and small thrust chambers?,"/Designation Mk 247, Mk 265 Laminac, 5,6% (igniters) (EBW) MB-1 (500-V Nitrocellulose, 1.0% initiator) FA.878 10, 17) M2 squib Egyptian lacquer, 10% Charcoal, 18% 40%Pyrotechnic igniters can be mounted in recesses as plugs of the screw-in type, in case of gas generators and small thrust chambers."
What is the primary characteristic of hypergolic igniters that differentiates them from traditional ignite systems?,"Hypergolic igniters are based on the property of some bi-propellant combinations which ignite spontaneously at room temperature when the two components (the fuel and the oxidiser) of a combination get in touch one with the other. Therefore, hypergolic combinations do not require an external source of ignition. They need only a valve to mix the fluids for the purpose of initiating the combustion. This method of ignition reduces the components of an ignition system, and therefore its chances of failure.. "
"What are the primary fuels utilized in hypergolic propellant combinations, and what oxidizers are typically paired with them?","As has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.2, the most common fuels used in a combi- nation of hypergolic propellants are hydrazine (HyNNH2), monomethyl hydrazine (CH3(NH)NHz2), unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (H2NN(CH3)2), and Aerozine 50, the last being an equal mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine. The oxidisers used in combination with these fuels are usually nitrogen tetroxide (N04) and various blends of nitrogen tetroxide with nitric oxide (NO).. "
What type of propellant mixture is used in the RD-180 engine for ignition in the liquid bi-propellant system?,"Hypergolic igniters have been used in liquid bi-propellant engines. An example has been cited in Sect. 2.1, which describes a mixture of gaseous fluorine with liquid oxygen used to start an engine which burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Two  further examples are cited below. The RD-180 engine of the Atlas V rocket burns a mixture of kerosene with liquid oxygen. This engine has a device, placed in the fuel line, for hypergolic ignition. "
What is the composition percentage of triethylaluminium in the described pyrophoric mixture?,"This device consists of two cartridges which contain a mixture of 15% triethylaluminium (Alo(C2Hs)¢, also known as TEA, which is a pyrophoric substance) with 85% triethylborane ((C2Hs)3B, also known as TEB). A scheme of the RD-180 engine is shown in the following figure, which is due to the courtesy of the United Launch Alliance [87].

"
What function do the burst diaphragms serve in the cylindrical cartridges containing the TEA-TEB mixture?,"As shown in the preceding figure, the TEA-TEB mixture is stored in two closed cylindrical cartridges, one of which is in the fuel line directly ahead of the pre-burner, and the other is in either of the main fuel inlet to the two main combustion chambers. The cartridges have burst diaphragms to prevent this mixture from coming in contact with atmospheric oxygen. The pre-burner illustrated above is the gas generator which drives the main turbine.. "
"What shape is the tank that initiates the engine, and how is it filled and pressurized?","In order to start the engine, a start tank of spherical shape, shown in the lower part of the preceding figure, is connected to both of the fuel lines by means of tubes and associated valves. The start tank is filled with fuel and put under pressure by using gas. When the valves to the fuel lines and the cartridges are opened, the high pressure of the fuel drives pistons which are in the cartridges. "
What initiates the combustion process within the gas generator and main combustion chambers involving a specific mixture and oxygen?,"This causes the TEA-TEB mixture to be released into the gas generator and into the main combustion chambers, which in turn have been filled with oxygen after the liquid oxygen valves are opened, and the tank pressure causes oxygen to enter the engine. The TEA-TEB mixture comes in touch with oxygen, and therefore self-ignites and starts the combustion inside the gas generator and the main combustion chambers. "
What component drives the boost pumps when the gas generator is operational?,"The combustion is sustained by the fuel entering the gas generator and the main combustion chambers just after the TEA-TEB mixture. Now, the gas generator is running, and therefore the main turbine drives the boost pumps (shown on the two sides of the preceding figure), which in  turn discharge the propellants under pressure to the gas generator and to the main combustion chambers.. "
What is the composition of the hypergolic fluid used in the igniter of the F-1 engine?,"The F-1 engine of the Saturn V rocket burns a mixture of RP-1 (kerosene) with liquid oxygen. This engine also has an igniter containing a cartridge of hypergolic fluid (which is, again, a mixture of 85% triethylborane with 15% triethylaluminium) with burst diaphragms at either end. This igniter is in the fuel line, and the hypergolic fluid has its own orifices in the injector of the main combustion chamber. "
What is the term used to describe the spontaneous ignition of a fluid when it contacts an injected oxidizer in a combustion chamber?,"The hyper- golic fluid, followed by the fuel, enters the main combustion chamber. There, this fluid ignites spontaneously in contact with the liquid oxygen already injected into the main combustion chamber. This method of ignition is also known as hypergolic starting slug [88].. "
What is the name of the modified Russian rocket engine that can be restarted and burns liquid oxygen and kerosene?,"The hypergolic igniters described in the examples cited above can only be used once, and therefore the rocket engines using them cannot be restarted. However, Hulka et al [89] have described a modified version of the Russian NK-33 rocket engine, called AJ26-59, which has the capability of being restarted. This engine burns liquid oxygen and kerosene, which of course are not hypergolic propellants, and also uses the TEA-TEB mixture for hypergolic ignition. "
How is the ability to restart a system achieved in relation to onboard cartridges?,Its capability of being restarted is obtained by carrying on board further cartridges of the TEA-TEB mixture than those necessary to the first start.. 
What is the benefit of using hypergolic propellants in rocket engines regarding ignition and restart capabilities?,"A rocket engine designed to burn exclusively hypergolic propellants does not require any special apparatus to be restarted as many times as necessary, because its propellants ignite spontaneously when coming in mutual contact. Such is the case, for example, with the AJ10-190 engine (whose fuel and oxidiser are respec- tively monomethy] hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) used in the orbital manoeuvring system of the Space Shuttle. "
What components are necessary for starting and stopping an engine that utilizes non-hypergolic propellants?,"An engine using other propellants than those of hyper- golic type requires a re-usable igniter (a spark plug, for example) and a system of valves in order to be started and stopped when necessary.. "
What types of ignition systems are commonly utilized in liquid-propellant rockets to achieve multiple starts effectively?,"Electric spark igniters based on spark plugs are often used in liquid-propellant rockets when multiple starts are necessary. They are efficient and reliable, and can be used in either direct spark igniters or augmented spark igniters."
What role does a high-voltage electric circuit play in the operation of direct spark igniters in combustion chambers?,"In case of a direct spark igniter, a high-voltage electric circuit is used to generate a spark across a gap, in order to expose the vaporised propellants in the combustion chamber to a ionising electric discharge, as shown in the following scheme, due to the courtesy of NASA [90].  oxygen Spark plug a park plug ar => hydrogen Direct spark igniters are used is small combustion chambers, because the electric discharge is confined to a very small zone. "
What type of igniter is utilized in the main engine of the Space Shuttle for ignition purposes?,"One of the six spark plugs used in the main engine of the Space Shuttle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [50].

"
What is the role of the electric discharge in the functioning of a specific igniter type for propellants?,"In this type of igniter, a small quantity of propellants (in the present case, hydrogen and oxygen) is swirled into a very small zone, where a spark plug generates an electric discharge. This causes the ionisation of the gasified propellants, which become very hot and generate a flame front which propagates toward the combustion zone, just when the rest of the propellants reaches the injector. The following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [50], illustrates an augmented spark igniter used in the main engine of the Space Shuttle.  A e a . 4 S ei : e 3 o> ;| i-@ ij i"" . { ] , !. "
"What component was utilized in the J-2 engine for initiating combustion, and how many spark plugs were incorporated for reliability in each unit?","The J-2 rocket engine, which was used for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles for the NASA Apollo programme, had an augmented spark igniter. Each of the main engines of the Space Shuttle had three augmented spark igniters, one for the main combustion chamber and two for the pre-burners. The chamber of each augmented spark igniter was located in the centre of the injector, as shown in the preceding figure. Two spark plugs were used, for redundancy, in each augmented spark igniter.. "
What role do catalysts play in the operation of rocket engines utilizing liquid mono-propellants?,"A further scheme of this type of igniter is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [91], which illustrates an augmented spark igniter used in a 445 N reaction control engine burning a mixture of liquid oxygen (LO2) with liquid methane (LCH,).  OS [ _—_~ \Jh MI — — \ | ‘ UL j In case of rocket engines using liquid mono-propellants (for example, hydrogen peroxide), catalysts are used to initiate and sustain the reaction of decomposition of the mono-propellant. "
What are the advantages of using solid catalysts over liquid catalysts in propulsion systems?,"Liquid catalysts, if used for this purpose, require complex systems of valves and interlocking devices. This can be avoided by using solid catalysts. These catalysts have also been used in liquid bi-propellant rocket engines. One of such engines is the AR2-3, which was developed by Rocketdyne in the 1950s, and is briefly described below. The AR2-3 is one of the family of AR engines, where AR stands for aircraft rocket. "
What is the fixed thrust output of the first engine in the described family?,"The first engine of this family was the AR-1, which operated at a fixed thrust of 25577 N. It was proven in flight on the FJ-4 aircraft. The AR2 series of engines includes the AR-2, the AR2-1, the AR2-2, and the AR2- 3. All the engines of the AR2 series have a main-stage thrust of 29358 N and are variable down to 14679 N of thrust. These engines use 90% hydrogen peroxide and kerosene. They have been used oh the FJ-4, F-86, and NF104A aircraft. "
"What type of engine is designed for enhancing aircraft thrust using liquid propellants, and what fuels does it utilize?","They are liquid-propellant pump-fed engines designed to provide aircraft thrust augmentation. The AR2-3 rocket engine supplies hydrogen peroxide and kerosene propellants to the thrust chamber by means of two centrifugal pumps (one for the oxidiser and one for the fuel). These pumps are directly driven by a single turbine. The pumps and the turbine are mounted on the same shaft. The oxidiser flows from the pump outlet through the pressure-actuated oxidiser valve, through the thrust chamber cooling jacket, and into the main thrust chamber, through the silver-plated catalytic screen pack, where it is decomposed into super-heated steam and oxygen. "
What type of fuel injector is utilized to introduce fuel into hot gases for combustion in the described system?,"The fuel flows from the pump outlet through the chamber-pressure-actuated fuel valve, into the concentric annular-ring type fuel injector, and is injected into the hot, oxygen-rich gases, where it burns and is exhausted through the 12:1 area ratio nozzle. The auto- ignition of the fuel eliminates the necessity of an ignition system. A small oxidiser flow, of about 3% from the oxidiser pump discharge, is delivered and metered through the thrust control valve into a catalytic gas generator, where it is decomposed into super-heated steam and oxygen to drive the turbine. "
"What components are involved in the functioning of the engine flow system, as indicated in the schematic provided?","A scheme of the engine flow described above is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [92].  — FUEL PUMP TURBINE OXIDIZER PUMP / § 4 GAS GENERATOR A ij fa : ] GAS by GENERATOR Kj VALVE ff FUEL s CHECK Hi Eva. i MAIN OXIDIZER X| * VALVE F—DXE? ruet DRAIN VALVE sy MAIN FUEL VALVE yee PURGE PURGE $$ 2 >———_, —— SOLENOID CHECK CATALYTIC SCREEN PACK = VALVE VALVE. "
What is the thrust produced by the engine when it operates in emergency conditions as a mono-propellant?,"Under emergency conditions, the engine may be operated as a mono-propellant engine using the oxidiser. The engine operates at a moderate chamber pressure and provides 29358 N of thrust in vacuo and 246 s specific impulse."
What are the potential consequences of delayed ignition within a combustion chamber in rocket propulsion systems?,"A timely ignition of the propellants is essential to the safe accomplishment of a mission. This holds in particular in case of manned missions. For this purpose, a safety device is required to control the supply of fuel or oxidiser or both to a liquid-propellant engine. A delayed ignition in the combustion chamber causes an accumulation of fuel within the chamber. This accumulation can cause an explosion and consequently the destruction of the engine or even of the whole vehicle on which the engine is mounted. "
How can destructive effects in a combustion chamber be mitigated during malfunction conditions?,"These destructive effects can be avoided by interrupting or reducing the flow of either fuel, or oxidiser, or both to the combustion chamber when the combustion does not take place within a proper period of time. When a malfunction is detected, the control system switches the engine to a safe lock-up mode or shuts the engine down.. "
What is the purpose of using an initial flow value that is lower than the operational flow value in propellant ignition systems?,"In order to assure a timely and even ignition of propellants and a smooth and quick increase in their flow to the rated value, the initial values of flow and mixture ratio are different from the corresponding operational values. A low initial value of flow prevents an excessive quantity of unburned fuel from accumulating in the combustion chamber. An initial value of mixture ratio close to the stoichiometric  value results in a high release of heat per unit mass of propellant. "
What is the effect of a fuel-rich mixture ratio on the specific impulse in operating conditions?,"This fact, in turn, makes it possible to the hot gases in the combustion chamber to reach an equilibrium more rapidly than would be the case with other values of mixture ratio. By contrast, as has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.4, the mixture ratio in operating conditions is usually fuel-rich, in order to obtain a high value of specific impulse.. "
What is the time range for valve movement from closed to fully open in a liquid-propellant rocket engine start sequence?,"According to Sutton and Biblarz [2], the total time required to start a liquid- propellant rocket engine comprises ideally the following times:(1) time (from 0.002 s to more than | s) taken by the valves, which control the admittance of the propellants in the combustion chamber, to move from the closed position to the fully open position;"
What is the duration required for propellants to travel from the valves to the injector's surface?,(2) time taken by the propellants to go from the valves to the injector face;
What is the duration required for droplets to vaporize and ignite in a combustion process?,(3) time taken by the propellants to form and mix discrete streams of droplets into the combustion chamber;(4) time (from 0.02 to 0.05 s) taken by the droplets of propellant to vaporise and ignite;(5) time taken by the flame front to propagate downstream of the ignition section along the axis of the combustion chamber; and
What is the duration required for propellant ignition to achieve self-sustaining combustion chamber conditions?,(6) time taken by the ignited propellant to raise the temperature and the pressure within the combustion chamber to values so high as to make the combustion self-sustaining.
"How does the size of the combustion chamber affect the duration of time intervals, excluding one specific interval?","There are overlaps in these intervals of time, because some of them may occur simultaneously. Apart from interval (4), the length of these intervals increases with the diameter of the combustion chamber."
What is the purpose of partially opening propellant valves during ignition in reducing unburned propellant accumulation in the combustion chamber?,"The propellant valves are designed in such a way as to operate in a desired sequence, in order to admit one of the propellant before the other in the combus- tion chamber, and to also control the flow and the mixture ratio. Such valves are often partially opened at the ignition time, for the purpose of avoiding the accumu- lation of unburned propellants in the combustion chamber. After a signal indicating a successful ignition has been received by the controller, the valves are moved to the fully open position and the full flow of propellants arrives at the combustion chamber.. "
What type of detectors are sensitive to visible or infrared radiation emitted from combusted gases during ignition?,"The signal of successful ignition can be generated by using several devices. Some of such devices are indicated below. They are:(b) Optical detectors, such as cells, mounted inside the combustion chamber, which are sensitive to the visible or infrared radiation which is emitted by the combusted gases."
What device measures the wavelength of emitted radiation to determine the temperature of combusted gases?,"(c) Pyrometers, which determine the temperature of the combusted gases by measuring the wavelength of the emitted radiation."
What type of electrical device is utilized to control the system in the fusible wire link mechanism?,"(d) Fusible wire links, which are based on a fusible wire strung between two parallel conductors placed near the exit section of the thrust chamber, downstream of the throat. This wire is also a conductor, which is fused by the ignition flame, when the combustion reaction has been initiated correctly. The control system is substantially an electric motor, which is connected to a source of electric  current (for example, to an accumulator). "
What happens to the propellant valves when the ignition fails to melt the wire in the motor circuit?,"When the wire is melted, due to the heat generated by a correct ignition, then the motor circuit is interrupted and the propellant valves reach the fully open position. By contrast, when the wire is not melted, because the combustion reaction has not been initiated correctly, then the electric motor continues to operate, and moves the propellant valves to the closed position. Before the rocket engine is started, the propellant valves are in the closed position and the electric circuit carries no current. "
What occurs when a switch is initially closed regarding current flow and valve position in an electric motor system?,"At the starting moment, the closure of a switch causes the electric motor to be fed by current, and therefore the propellant valves are moved toward the open position. A device like this was invented in 1952 by Prentiss [93].. "
What type of devices can identify pressure increases in combustion chambers and function effectively in high-pressure environments for multiple ignition cycles?,"(e) Pressure-sensing devices, apt to detect the pressure rise in the combustion chamber due to a correct ignition of the propellants. Such devices, if capable of withstanding very high pressures, can also be used for multi-start engines."
What type of wires can measure varying electric resistance based on ignition presence and withstand high temperatures for engine applications?,"(f) Resistance wires, capable of measuring different values of electric resis- tance depending on whether a correct ignition has, or has not, taken place in the combustion chamber. Such devices, if capable of withstanding high temperatures without melting, can also be used for multi-start engines."
What term describes the presence of continuous pressure fluctuations in the combustion chamber of certain engines?,"(g) Electric devices used in spark plugs. Such devices detect the correct operation of spark plugs by sensing the ionisation near the electrodes.As has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.6, by combustion instability we mean thepresence of self-sustaining pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber of arocket engine. This phenomenon can appear in thermal devices when an unsteady"
"What phenomenon occurs when heat release coincides with acoustic fluctuations, leading to amplification of perturbations in a rocket engine?","release of heat is coupled with pressure oscillations. In a rocket engine, the heat released by the substances which react chemically is coupled with acoustic fluctu- ations. When the unsteady heat release and the acoustic fluctuations are in phase, then even a small perturbation will amplify according to the criterion enunciated by Lord Rayleigh. This criterion states that “If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged. "
What occurs to pitch when heat is added a quarter period before the phase of maximum condensation in a vibration system?,"On the other hand, if heat be given at the moment of greatest rarefaction, or abstracted at the moment of greatest condensation, the vibra- tion is discouraged”. In addition, “When the transfer of heat takes place at the moment of greatest condensation or of greatest rarefaction, the pitch is not affected ... the pitch is raised if heat be communicated to the air a quarter period before the phase of greatest condensation; and the pitch is lowered if heat be communicated a quarter period after the phase of greatest condensation” [94]. "
"What occurs in a combustion chamber when heat release and pressure fluctuations are synchronized, leading to significant pressure oscillations?","In other terms, the oscilla- tions in a combustor are self-sustained when the rate of heat release and the pressure fluctuations are in phase. When this happens, pressure oscillations of large ampli- tude occur in a combustion chamber at frequencies of hundreds of hertz. Acoustic waves cause unsteadiness in a combustion process. An unsteady combustion process,  in turn, generates new acoustic waves. This fact can be represented graphically by means of the following feedback scheme.. "
What occurs to the flame in the combustion chamber when the heat release rate is synchronized with pressure variations at the heat source?,"An unsteady release of heat adds energy to the acoustic waves in the combustion chamber, when the unsteady heat release rate is in phase with the pressure oscillations at the location of the heat source, in accordance with the criterion of Lord Rayleigh. Consequently, the flame in the chamber may be extinguished or may come back to the injector face and burn part of the injection system. The amplitude of these oscillations can become so large as to damage the structure of the combustion chamber or destroy the engine.. "
What are the fundamental modes of acoustic combustion instability described in pressure wave dynamics?,"These pressure waves can travel at sonic velocities up and down the length of the combustion chamber, around it, across it, or radially in and out. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [95], shows the fundamental modes of acoustic combustion instability.—— pe | ———-> LONGITUDINAL RADIAL STANDING TRANSVERSE SPINNING TRANSVERSE"
"What issue was observed during the testing of the F-1 engine, which affected the pressure within the combustor?","The F-1 engine, which was designed in the 1950s for the Saturn V rocket, was subject to combustion instability. This instability was observed for more than seven years during the development of the engine. Twenty of the forty-four tests of the first F-1 engine showed pressure oscillations due to combustion instability with peak amplitudes greater than or comparable to the average pressure in the combustor. "
What effects do pressure oscillations have on the injector face in terms of physical damage?,"The  pressure oscillations caused erosion and burning of the injector face, as a result of large radial and tangential motions of the gas.. "
What component was modified in the F-1 engine to control the movement of pressure waves during the Project First programme?,"In order to solve the instability problems, a programme called Project First was created to develop a stable F-1 engine. This programme lasted for four years: from 1962 to 1965. During this time, the engine was subject to more than 2000 full-scale tests [96]. Copper baffles were added to the injector plate to restrain the propagation of the pressure waves. The recovered injector plate of an F-1 engine (on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.) is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Wikipedia [97].. "
What device is utilized in a Pratt & Whitney FT8 gas turbine to absorb vibrations at a specific frequency?,"Another example of passive control is the Pratt & Whitney FT8 gas turbine, which uses 13 Helmholtz resonators. These devices act as vibration absorbers, whose shape is chosen so that the absorption is tuned to a particular frequency, as the sequel will show."
What techniques can effectively disrupt the symmetry of a combustion chamber to mitigate acoustic resonances linked with heat release?,"As has been shown above, the symmetry of the combustion chamber lends itself to certain natural acoustic modes which are driven into resonance because of their coupling with the rate of heat release. Several methods of breaking the symmetry of the chamber have been proven effective in quenching the combustion instabilities."
How are combustion instabilities categorized based on their frequency ranges?,"Combustion instabilities have been classified according to their respective frequency ranges, even though there are no sharp limiting lines to separate the so-called low, intermediate, and high frequency ranges."
What defines the low-frequency class of pressure waves in relation to their frequencies and wave lengths compared to a combustion chamber's characteristic length?,"The low-frequency (also called chugging) class includes pressure waves whose frequencies are less than 180 hertz [5]. In other terms, the low-frequency class includes waves whose lengths are much larger than the characteristic length (defined  in Sect. 2.4) of the combustion chamber. The instabilities belonging to this class begin with a sinusoidal wave, whose amplitude grows linearly with time. Such instabilities result from a coupling between the combustion process and the feed system [47]. "
What methods can be employed to mitigate specific issues in an injector's performance?,"They are usually eliminated by increasing the pressure drop in the injector, or by increasing the length-to-diameter ratio in the injector, or by decreasing the volume of the combustion chamber [49].. "
What frequency threshold defines pressure waves classified as high-frequency or screaming in sonic applications?,"The high-frequency (also called screaming) class includes pressure waves whose frequencies are equal to or greater than 1000 hertz [5]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [98], shows pressure oscillation in a combustion chamber of a rocket engine in the presence of a high-frequency instability."
What type of instability relies on an oscillatory energy source derived from the combustion of propellants to maintain its destructive effects?,"This is type of combustion instability which causes the most destructive effects. An oscillatory source of energy is required to sustain this particular instability. This energy comes from the combustion of the propellants, and is supplied according to the manner in which the combustion takes place. Each pressure wave interacts with the burning gases so strongly as to receive the sustaining energy directly from them, which means within a time interval no longer than the semi-period of the wave itself. "
What factors can affect the efficiency of energy transfer in combustion-related pressure waves?,"Some of the means by which the combustion process supplies energy to the pressure waves are loss of ignition, delays due to chemical preparation or other causes, detonations, anomalous behaviour of droplets heated above their critical temperature and pressure, et c.. "
What are the two main approaches to address combustion instability in high-frequency systems?,"The two principal methods used to eliminate the combustion instability of the high-frequency class are the following: (1) changing the environment in which the combustion process takes place, by changing either the geometric properties of the combustion chamber or the manner (pattern of the injection holes, or size of the injector holes, or pressure drop) in which the propellants are injected into the combustion chamber; and (2) increasing the damping characteristics of the combus- tion chamber. "
What types of devices are used for passive control in a combustion chamber?,"Some means of passive control, which can be classified in the second of these methods, are baffles, acoustic liners, and resonators installed in the combustion chamber. They are briefly described below.. "
What function do mechanical devices serve in managing gas flow near an injector face?,"Baffles are mechanical devices meant to regulate or restrain the gas flow in the vicinity of the injector face, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [49]. Baffles have been used successfully to prevent transverse acoustic modes of combustion instability. The transverse (that is, tangential and radial) modes  are characterised by oscillatory pressure waves and gas particle motion parallel to the injector face [74]. "
What is the primary function of an acoustic liner within a combustion chamber?,"Injector ° Ee Of FDR _ Bolfle blode (as > SA SK PES Combustion chomber oi <7 4 “aN Another device for passive control is an acoustic liner installed within the combus- tion chamber.

"
What effect do resonator cavities have on fluid movement at the boundaries in a combustion chamber?,"This combustion chamber consists of a composite cylindrical brazed shell with integral coolant passages. The liner apertures are drilled in spaces between the rect- angular passages. The resonator cavities have a damping effect, because they allow a normal velocity at the wall which has a component in phase with the pressure oscil- lation. This means that work is done over each cycle in moving the fluid back and forth at the boundary. This work is equal to the energy dissipated due to jet formation and friction [49].. "
What are the two prevalent varieties of acoustic resonators?,Two common types of acoustic resonators are Helmholtz resonators and quarter- wavelength tubes.
What are the critical geometric parameters that characterize a Helmholtz resonator and influence its function in mitigating pressure oscillations?,"A Helmholtz resonator is a rigid-walled cavity of volume V (m?), which is connected through a circular orifice of diameter d (m) and length ¢ (m) to the combustion chamber, where undesirable pressure oscillations are expected to occur. A Helmholtz resonator is shown in the following figure.  d see ‘ | 1 ‘ ; t V ) { 1 { 1 For the frequencies of interest, the wavelength A of the pressure oscillations is assumed to be much greater than the dimensions of the resonator, that is, A>e A>d 1 A> Vs.

What factors must be adjusted to achieve resonance at a specific frequency in a Helmholtz resonator?,"By choosing properly the values of these dimensions, this device can be made resonant at any desired frequency. The resonance frequency f (Hz) of a Helmholtz resonator is [99]:"
What is the mathematical representation of the area of an orifice based on its diameter?,"a S > a md 2 fo= x VO+Al)] 2x L4V(E4 AD) where a = (yRT)* (m/s) is the speed of sound, S = 2d?/4 (m7) is the area of the orifice, and Aé = 0.85d (m) is the length correction, which takes account of the flow effects in the vicinity of the orifice ends."
What components are included in the mechanical representation analogous to a Helmholtz resonator?,"As has been shown by several authors (see, for example, [100], a Helmholtz resonator is analogous to a mechanical system comprising a body of mass m, a spring of elastic constant k, and a dashpot of mechanical resistance R,,, which is subject to a force F(t) = A cos wt.

What is the expression for the differential equation that describes the motion of a mass subjected to a driving force represented by a cosine function?,"In this mechanical system, the elastic constant k of the spring corresponds to pa’S?/V, and the mass m of the body corresponds to pS(€ + A€), where p is the density of the unperturbed gas. The differential equation governing the motion of the body of mass m in the direction x of the driving force F(t) = A cos wt is"
"What is the resonance frequency for the given mechanical system defined by the relation involving parameters m, k, and R?","ax dx m— + Ry— +kx = Acosat de ""at As is well known, the resonance frequency of this mechanical system is 1(k\3 2 = 375)"
What equation expresses the relationship between the resonance frequency of a Helmholtz resonator and natural frequencies of vibration within a combustion chamber?,This equation accounts for the expression fy = [a/(27)]{S/[V(€ + A€)] }? written above for the resonance frequency of a Helmholtz resonator.A Helmholtz resonator can be tuned to a resonant frequency which corresponds to one of the natural frequencies of vibration of the combustion chamber. These natural frequencies can be determined as will be shown below.
"What is the formula for the resonance frequency of a tube that is a quarter-wavelength long, considering the length correction factor?","Another type of acoustic resonator commonly used to damp pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber is a quarter-wavelength tube. It is similar to a Helmholtz resonator, but has no cavity, as shown in the following figure.  d et t 1 t 1 t 1 c t 1 t 1 t 1 t u t 1 i J t 1 QE eel The resonance frequency f (Hz) of a quarter-wavelength tube is [99]: a fo= 4(l + Ab) where a = (yRT)* (m/s) is the speed of sound, @ (m) is the length of the quarter- wavelength tube, and Aé = 0.85d (m) is the correction of the tube length @.. "
How were natural vibration modes evaluated in a combustion chamber using sound pressure levels influenced by acoustic waves?,"In order to determine the natural modes of vibration for a given combustion chamber, Frendi et al [99] placed a loudspeaker at the centre of the inlet boundary of their combustion chamber. The loudspeaker emitted plane harmonic or random acoustic waves. A random acoustic disturbance was generated by the loudspeaker, and the sound pressure level (dB) was determined as a function of frequency at several points in the combustion chamber. "
What method was used to excite the individual vibration modes of the combustion chamber in the study?,"By so doing, several peaks corresponding to the various vibration modes of the combustion chamber were determined. In order to determine the mode shapes, the individual modes were excited by introducing a plane, harmonic acoustic wave at the given frequency. After determining the natural frequencies (512 and 1880 Hz) of their combustion chamber, Frendi et al [99] selected the frequency of 1880 Hz, corresponding to one of the natural frequencies found by them, for extensive tests. Consequently, the resonant frequency f of the acoustic devices indicated above was tuned to 1880 Hz.. "
What type of resonator utilizes slots rather than circular openings for acoustic resonance?,"Other types of acoustic resonators than those described above have slots instead of circular orifices, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [74].  PARTITION(ston) RESONATOR CAVITY UNIFCPM WIDTH SLOT (CAVITY) CAVITY (a) HEUMHOLTZ (b) QUARTERWAVE (c) INTE3MEDIATE OR RESONATOR RESONATOR GENZRAUZED RESONATOR"
What are the three types of resonators based on the comparative widths of their cavities and slots?,"They are said to be of the Helmholtz, quarter-wavelength, or intermediate type, according to whether the width of their cavities is much larger, or equal, or slightly larger in comparison with the width of their slots."
What frequency range characterizes the medium-frequency class of pressure waves associated with combustion noise?,"The medium-frequency (also called buzzing) class includes pressure waves whose frequencies are in the range 180-1000 hertz [5]. The beginning of a medium- frequency instability usually shows a growing coherence of the combustion noise at a particular frequency with slowly increasing amplitude. There is usually wave motion in the propellant feed system. There may also be wave motion in the combus- tion chamber, but this motion does not usually correspond in phase and frequency to a natural mode of the chamber itself. "
"What type of instability, more common in medium-sized engines, can degrade performance without immediately damaging the system?","The shape of the pressure wave is very nearly sinusoidal, and one or both of the propellant feed system may be highly coupled. Buzzing-type instabilities are not particularly damaging if they remain at low ampli- tudes, but may degrade performance, total impulse, or thrust vector. In some case, the amplitude increases to such an extent as to triggering a high-frequency mode [49]. This type of instability occurs more frequently in medium-size engines (whose thrust is in the range 2000-250,000 N) than in large engines [2].. "
What term describes the longitudinal vibrations in rocket vehicles caused by the interaction between the vehicle structure and the propulsion system?,"Finally, many rocket vehicles propelled by engines burning liquid propellants are subject to longitudinal vibrations, because of an instability arising from interaction of the vehicle structure with the propulsion system. This phenomenon has been nicknamed pogo instability, because of its analogy with the motion of a pogo jumping stick. Pogo instabilities can occur in the propellant feed lines of large vehicles, such as space launch vehicles or ballistic missiles [2].. "
What type of instability primarily causes oscillations in the first longitudinal mode during the operation of a launch vehicle's initial stage?,"The oscillations due to the pogo instability occur principally in the first longitu- dinal mode of the structure during operation of the first stage (burning liquid propel- lants) of a launch vehicle. The effects of this instability are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [101]. "
What is the duration range for the spontaneous occurrence and eventual decrease of oscillatory vibrations?,"The pogo vibrations begin spontaneously, then intensify, and finally die away in a period of time ranging from 10 to 40 s. The frequency of vibration follows the frequency of the first structural mode, which increases with the consumption of propellants. Pogo vibrations have also occurred, but less often, in higher modes of longitudinal oscillation. More periods than one of instability have also been observed, each of which with its own mode of vibration, during operation of a single stage of a rocket vehicle. "
"What is the peak acceleration amplitude, in meters per second squared, at the engine when the acceleration due to gravity is 9.80665 m/s²?","Vibrations have occurred in the range from 5 to 60 Hz, and vibration amplitudes (from zero to the peak values) have reached 17 go at the input to the payload and 34 go at the engine [101], where go = 9.80665 m/s? is the acceleration of gravity at the surface of the Earth.. "
"What component is utilized in propulsion systems of certain launch vehicles to mitigate vibrations that may harm crew, equipment, and structural integrity?","The pogo vibrations can damage the crew and the equipment, and can also overload the structure of a rocket vehicle. In addition, they impair the propulsion performance of the vehicle.In order to suppress these vibrations, hydraulic accumulators have been installed in the propulsion systems of launch vehicles such as the Saturn V and the Space Shuttle."
What component in the Space Shuttle's main engines helps reduce pressure oscillations from the oxidiser feed system?,"As an example, each of the three main engines of the Space Shuttle has a pogo suppression system accumulator, which is attached to the low-pressure oxidiser duct. The accumulator, when pressurised with gaseous oxygen coming from the heat exchanger coil, dampens the pressure oscillations due to the oxidiser feed system. This accumulator is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [50]. "
What is the diameter of the hollow metallic sphere attached to the low-pressure oxidiser duct?," RIV Attach Flange Inlet Diffuser ~» A ES Overflow (from GOX Tube control valve) ig | y LY CY } Cruciform . 6, 9 Baffle x be 7 Annular Ring Baffle Z-Slot S Baffle Plate 4) Kes 4 ‘2 KA hese cee} 8 Low-Pressure 9) S07 Oxidizer Duct we >. Multiorifice Attachment 7 Baffle Plates Flange It is a hollow metallic sphere, 32 cm in diameter, which is mounted by a flange to the low-pressure oxidiser duct. During engine operation, the accumulator is pres- surised with gaseous oxygen. "
How does the gaseous oxygen influence the pressure stability within the accumulator?,"The gaseous oxygen is a compliant medium in direct contact with the liquid oxygen, and is therefore capable of smoothing the oxidiser flow by absorbing the pressure oscillations. The pressure in the accumulator is main- tained by a constant flow of gaseous oxygen into, through, and out of the accumulator. The gaseous oxygen comes from the heat exchanger coil, flows through the gaseous oxygen control valve into the accumulator, exits through the bottom of the inverted standpipe (overflow tube), and returns to the oxidiser feed system to be re-condensed in the liquid state [50]. "
How does the accumulator function in relation to vibration effects on fluid in the External Tank during Space Shuttle operations?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [102], shows schematically how the accumulator described above is used to suppress the pogo vibrations in the Space Shuttle.  Vibration causes fluid oscillation in the External Tank. Fuel line fluid gains f the oscillation. Q | The | - accumulator ‘ dampens iz the oscillation 4 before the fluid reaches the engines.

What are the primary considerations when selecting a feed system for a rocket propulsion system?,"As a general rule, the choice of a feed system, independently of whether it uses gases under pressure or pumps, depends on several factors, which are principally the mission which the rocket vehicle is meant to accomplish, the size and the mass of this vehicle, the intensity and the duration of the thrust, the space available to the engine, the degree of reliability of the propulsion system, and so on. In practice, according to Lee et al. [2], a pump-fed propulsion system is chosen when:. "

A gas under pressure must be chemically compatible with the propellants and also with the materials of which the tanks and the lines are made, at the temperatures of operation. The feed system using this gas must be simple and reliable. The gas used in the feed system must have a low molar mass, in order for the value of the mass ratio mo/m, (where mo is the mass of the rocket vehicle at launch, and m, is its mass at burnout) to be low.

What are the advantages of using a gas with low molar mass and low boiling point in propulsion systems?,"Helium is preferred to other gases for the following reasons: ¢ low molar mass (M = 4 kg/kmol) and therefore low total mass;e low boiling point (4.22 K at atmospheric pressure); and e absence of chemical reactivity.In case of a bi-propellant engine using liquid hydrogen as its fuel, gaseous hydrogen has also been used as the pressurising agent."
What was the gas used in the Lunar Orbiter's velocity and reaction control system that did not require thermal conditioning?,"Helium or other pressurised gases can be stored in a vessel with or without a system for thermal conditioning. A thermal conditioning (that is, heating or cooling or both) of the gas can lead to low-mass systems. On the other hand, a thermal conditioning of the gas implies high complexity and cost. A successful system which did not condition thermally the stored gas (nitrogen) was the Lunar Orbiter velocity and reaction control system. "
What percentage reduction in mass was achieved by using supercritical helium storage compared to ambient-temperature high-pressure storage?,"By contrast, in the descent stage illustrated above of the Apollo lunar module, helium under pressure was stored under supercritical conditions and then heated. This led to a reduction in mass of 60% over that of an ambient- temperature high-pressure storage without thermal conditioning. These two systems of storage are briefly described below.. "
Describe the function and importance of the control system utilized in the Lunar Orbiter IV's velocity and reaction management.,"The velocity and reaction control system of the Lunar Orbiter IV is shown schematically in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [6]."
What is the thrust force provided by the engine in the described system?,"This system was designed so that its 445-N-thrust engine, using a hypergolic combination of oxidiser (N2O4) and fuel (Aerozine-50), could impart a velocity change of 1017 m/s to the 387 kg spacecraft for mid-course corrections, injection into an initial lunar orbit, and successive injection into a photographic orbit. The source of ullage gas was a spherical tank containing gaseous nitrogen (N2) without provision for conditioning the temperature of this gas. "
What is the internal pressure of the storage vessel in pascals?,"The tank was made of Ti- 6AI-4V alloy, with a mass of 9.9 kg and an internal volume of 0.0259 m?. A mass of 6.56 kg of nitrogen was stored into this sphere at a pressure of 2.4 x 107 N/m? and at a temperature of 294 K. Two parallel-redundant normally-closed squib valves isolated the pressurising gas in the storage vessel from the rest of the system until the gas was required for its first use. The gas in the storage vessel was also the source for the cold-gas reaction control system, which is shown in the lower portion of the preceding figure. "
What was the reduced pressure of the gas in the velocity control system after passing through the pressure regulator?,"Only part (from 0.91 to 1.36 kg) of the nitrogen mass in the storage vessel was used to generate and maintain the pressure in the propellant tanks for the velocity control system; the remaining part was used for the reaction control system and for reserve of pressurising gas. When the squib valves were opened, the pressurising gas flowed through a normally-open shut-off squib valve to the pressure regulator of the velocity control system, which reduced the pressure of the gas to 1.3 x 10° N/m’. "
What is the purpose of using a single regulator in a velocity control system for propellant tanks?,"The gas was then routed through the check valves and into the oxidiser and fuel tanks. In the velocity control system, a single regulator was used to pressurise both of the propellant tanks, in order to preclude undesired in-flight shifts of propellant mixture ratio; such shifts could occur if each tank had its own pressure regulator and the regulator set-point of one changed during flight. With a single regulator, the set-point could still change, but each tank could have the same ullage pressure. "
What function do check valves serve in preventing the interaction between ullage gases from different tanks?,"Though each tank had a bladder, check valves were used to isolate the ullage gases of the fuel and oxidiser tanks. If any propellant vapour permeated one of  such bladders, the check valves prevented the vapour from entering the other system. After the velocity control system completed its function, the normally-open shut-off squib valve was set to the closed position, in order to isolate the velocity control system regulator and tankage from the gas in the storage vessel. "
What hypergolic propellants were utilized in the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module for its propulsion system?,"Each ullage had a pressure relief system to protect the system from over-pressures. The pressurisation system of the Lunar Orbiter velocity and reaction control system was subject to leakages only two times during twenty-eight engine firings in five different missions [2]. 1S ph | SQuiB VALVE (__ Qi Nieocen t---— Co tutte, nitrocen REGULATOR, 1 = REGULATOR PRESSURE, 0 PRESSURE, N.

"
What type of vessel was utilized to hold 22 kg of supercritical helium during the descent stage of the lunar module?,"In the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module, a double-walled, Mylar®-insulated, high-pressure, cryo- genic vessel was used to store 22 kg of supercritical helium for the pressurisation system. The helium tank was loaded with liquid helium at 4.4 K and topped with  high-pressure gaseous helium, which increased the system temperature to approx- imately 6-7 K. During the 131-h (maximum) standby period, the helium pressure and temperature were increased by incoming heat leak. "
What is the maximum recorded temperature of helium before it began to flow out?,"The maximum temperature reached by helium prior to outflow was 28 K, and the rate of pressure rise ranged from 9.6 to 19.2 N/(m?s). The feed system for the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module is illustrated schematically in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5].

What is the maximum flow rate of the helium fluid in kg/s as it passes through the initial loop of the heat exchanger?,"Engine Interface Engine With reference to the colours shown in the preceding figure, the helium fluid (cyan) passed at a maximum flow rate of 0.000668 kg/s through the first loop of the external two-pass fuel-to-helium heat exchanger, where it absorbed heat from the fuel (red). Then, the helium (dark green) was warmed and routed back through the internal helium-to-helium heat exchanger inside the cryogenic storage vessel. "
What is the approximate temperature to which helium is heated before being used as a pressurising agent for the propulsion system's fuel and oxidiser tanks?,"The warm helium transferred heat to the remaining supercritical helium in the cryogenic storage  vessel, and caused an increase in pressure, so that continuous expulsion of helium was ensured throughout the period of operation. After the helium passed through the internal helium-to-helium heat exchanger, where it was cooled, it was routed back (light green) through the second loop of the fuel-to-helium heat exchanger, and was heated to approximately 278 K before being delivered (medium green) as the pressurising agent for the fuel (red) and oxidiser (blue) tanks of the propulsion system. "
What benefits did a supercritical-helium storage system provide for the Apollo lunar module's descent stage?,The use of a supercritical-helium storage tank and passive control configuration for the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module reduced the number of components required and resulted in a high degree of reliability [2].. 
What are some alternative combinations of components in pressurisation systems aside from those specifically mentioned?,The pressurisation systems described above are only two particular examples of component combinations. Further combinations can be found in [7].
What factors contribute to the determination of the total mass of stored gas in a pressurized system?,"The requirements for the gas under pressure, which have been considered in Sect. 3.2, apply only to the net or effective mass m, of gas necessary to pressurise the tanks of propellant. However, the gross mass m, of the stored gas depends also on the system design, on the gas expansion during operation, and on the range of the environmental temperature. The gross mass m, of the stored gas results from a sum, whose addends are the net mass mz of the stored gas, the mass ms, of the residual gas in the storage vessel, the mass mg of the residual gas in the lines downstream of the regulator, the mass m_,, of the residual mass in the heat exchanger, etc., as follows. "
What is the significance of the use factor in relation to the gross and net mass of a pressurising gas?,"A parameter which takes account of the additional terms indicated above is the use factor of the pressurising gas. This parameter, whose value is greater than unity, is defined as the ratio m,/mg of the gross mass to the net mass of the pressuring gas. The lowest value of pressure in a storage vessel depends on the values of the pressure drops in the various components (regulator, heat exchanger, etc.) which make up a feed system and also on a safety value. "
Under what condition is the expansion of gas in a storage vessel considered to be isentropic?,"The pressurising action of a stored gas is considered to have come to an end when the pressure in its storage vessel decays to 2.758 x 10° N/m? [3]. When a source of heat is present inside the storage vessel, then the expansion of the gas in the vessel is assumed to be polytropic (pV” = constant), that is, such as to involve a transfer of heat and work. By contrast, when no source of heat is present in the storage vessel, then the expansion of the gas in the vessel can be assumed to be isentropic (pV” = constant), that is, frictionless and without heat transfer between the gas and the vessel walls. The following equation can be used to calculate the final temperature T, (K) of the gas in the storage vessel. "
What is the value of the exponent for an isentropic expansion of helium?,"oa Ti Pi where T, (K) is the initial temperature of the gas in the storage vessel, n is the exponent of the polytropic expansion, and pz (N/m?) and p; (N/m?) are respectively the final pressure and the initial pressure in the storage vessel. The value of the exponent n is first estimated, and then verified experimentally. In case of an isentropic expansion of helium, n = y = cp/c, = 1.667 [4]."
What factors influence the determination of pressurizing gas mass and storage vessel volume in a pressure-feed system?,"In most cases, the expansion process through the regulator and the lines can be considered adiabatic, so that the total temperature remains constant. This expansion comes to an end in the propellant tanks. The temperature of the propellants in the tanks is assumed to be equal to the temperature at the outlet section of the heat exchanger. For a specified range of temperatures in a pressure-feed system, the lower value can be used to determine the mass of the pressurising gas, and the upper value can be used to determine the volume of the storage vessel, for a given storage pressure [3].. "
What is the pressure in the storage vessel at system burnout in pascals?,"In the following example of application, an isentropic expansion process is assumed to occur in the oxidiser (N2O4) tank of a pressure-fed system having the following properties: temperature range 278-311 K in the storage vessel at the system start, pressure p, = 3.1 x 107 N/m? in the storage vessel at the system start, pressure Pu = 2.76 x 10° N/m? in the storage vessel at burnout, volume Vy = 0.0113 m? in the gas lines downstream of the regulator, volume V,, = 0.0283 m? in the heat exchanger, negligible residual volume in the gas lines, and a 2% reserve of pres- surising gas. "

These values are also given below for convenience: absolute pressure in the oxidiser tank pr = 1.14 x 10° N/m?, vaporisation temperature of the oxidiser T,, = 357 K, heat of vaporisation of the oxidiser h, = 414000 J/kg, mean value of the specific heat of the oxidiser at constant pressure in liquid state cp; = 1760 J/(kg K), mean value of the specific heat of the oxidiser at constant pressure in vapour state cp, = 754 J/(kg K), compressibility factor of the oxidiser Z = 0.95, and molar mass of the oxidiser M = 2 x 14+ 4 x 16 = 92 kg/kmol. "
What is the specific heat of helium at 293 K and atmospheric pressure expressed in joules per kilogram per kelvin?,"The temperature of the gas in the ullage space at burnout is T,, = 389 K. The specific heat at constant pressure of the pressurising gas (helium) at 293 K and atmospheric pressure is cpg = 5190 J/(kg K) and its molar mass is M = 4 kg/kmol.. "
"What is the mass of the residual pressurising gas in the lines downstream of the regulator, given the temperature, pressure, and volume provided?","In Sect. 3.2, the net mass of the pressurising gas has been found to be mg = 4.469 kg. The temperature and the pressure of the residual pressurising gas in the lines downstream of the regulator after shutdown are assumed to have the same values as those of the ullage gases in the oxidiser tank at burnout, which are respectively T, = 389 K and pr = 1.14 x 10° N/m?.

Why are spherical containers preferred for storing pressurized gases in comparison to other shapes?,"Gases under pressure are usually stored in spherical vessels, because of the struc- tural efficiency of the spherical shape, which implies a lower mass than is possible with other shapes. Such vessels are usually of monocoque design, operate at high stress levels, are mounted within the rocket vehicle, and are insulated from deflec- tion of the vehicle structure by appropriately designed mountings [2]. "
What structural technique relies solely on an external skin to bear loads without an internal frame?,"By the way, monocoque (a French word meaning single shell) is a structural technique in which a body supports loads through its external skin, with no internal frame to hold the body rigid. The alloy most often used to construct storage vessels is Ti6Al4V [8].. "
"How can the mass of a spherical vessel be estimated based on its thickness, internal diameter, and material density?","An estimate for the mass m (kg) of a spherical vessel of thickness ¢ (m), inside diameter d (m), and made of a material having uniform density p (kg/m?) can be made as follows"
What assumption is made regarding the weld seam in the estimation of mass for a vessel made of two hemispherical components?,"Another estimate, suggested by Huzel and Huang [3], for the same mass m (kg) can be made by assuming a vessel made of two hemispherical shells, such that the thickness of the weld lands is taken into account by assuming a band of width w (m) and thickness equal to one-half the wall thickness placed over the weld seam. This estimate is"
"What are the symbols representing maximum pressure and allowable working stress in a gas storage vessel, and what units are they measured in?","where p (N/m?) is the maximum pressure at which the gas is stored, and o (N/m?) is the allowable working stress of the material of which the vessel is made."
"What factors influence the tendency of gases to leak from storage vessels, particularly focusing on molar mass and material quality?","The storage vessel must be capable of containing the gas at high pressure for long periods of time without losses due to leakage. Gases having low molar masses, such as hydrogen and helium, are less subject to leak through homogeneous metals of good quality than is the case with those having high molar masses. Leakages can occur through porous metals, for example, through castings and welded joints.. "
What is the function of a pressure regulator in a pressure-fed propulsion system?,"The pressure-fed systems cited above (used for the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module and for the velocity and reaction control system of the Lunar Orbiter) have, each of them, a pressure regulator for the gases (respectively, helium and nitrogen) stored under pressure. A regulator maintains the desired values of flow and pressure to the propellant tanks as the pressure of the stored gas decreases.. "

What mechanism enables sealing to the seat in a pressure regulator with an unbalanced poppet?,"With reference to the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [9], this pressure regulator has an unbalanced poppet, which achieves sealing to the seat by means of the upstream pressure force. In addition, the poppet is held against the seat by an axial guidance flexure."
What components are involved in the actuation mechanism that respond to changes in downstream pressure?,"The actuation mechanism consists of a bellows, which is exposed to space inter- nally and to the regulator downstream pressure externally, and which is held in the null position by one or more coil springs. If the regulator downstream pressure decreases from the preset pressure, the reference spring force overcomes the bellows pressure force and the actuator exerts a net opening force on the poppet through the lever arrangement. "
What causes the poppet to return to its seated position after the downstream pressure reaches the designated level?,"When this net force is greater than the poppet seating force, the poppet opens and allows the gas (helium) under pressure to pressurise the downstream side of the regulator. When the downstream regulator pressure rises back up to the set pressure, the actuator returns to the null position and the poppet is caused to return to the seat by the axial guidance flexure spring force and the difference of pressure across the poppet [9]. "
What component is designed to integrate with the nozzle's diverging section to heat gas under pressure?," The heat exchanger, which warms the gas under pressure, may be designed to form an integral part of the diverging portion of the nozzle, as shown in the following figure.

The heat transferred by conduction from the nozzle wall to the heat exchanger can be assumed to be entirely  absorbed by the pressurising gas which circulates in the heat exchanger, and therefore the temperature of the pressurising gas increases.

K~!) on the side of the pressurising gas and the design of the heat exchanger can be done as has been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.5. The number of turns in the heat exchanger around the nozzle depends on the required increase in temperature of the pressurising gas and also on the position of the heat exchanger along the nozzle. The various temperatures in the elements of the heat exchanger can be expressed by means of the following equation [3]: ; bor iy! T.+T, MyCp(To — T)) = A(z + k + x) (to - ost). "

What factors influence the selection of materials for the construction of a heat exchanger tube?,"The temperature of the pressurising gas which leaves the heat exchanger at any time also depends on the temperature of the same gas at the exit section of the storage vessel. The material, of which the tube of the heat exchanger is made, is to be chosen by the designer bearing in mind the necessity of attaching firmly by brazing the tube to the wall of the nozzle. The width of this tube depends on the thermal and mechanical loads to which the tube is subject.. "
What type of application involves the design of a heat transfer device utilized in conjunction with other similar devices for a specific section of a rocket engine?,"The following example of application concerns the design of a heat exchanger of the type illustrated above, used in parallel with other heat exchangers and placed at the cross-section of area ratio A/A,; = 10 of a nozzle extension for a rocket engine of known characteristics."

We want to determine the dimensions and the number of turns for the tube of the heat exchanger, assuming this tube to be made of an alloy Ti-13V—11Cr—3Al, aged at 763 K, having the following thermal and mechanical characteristics [10]: tensile yield strength oy = 1.3 x 10° N/m?,  modulus of elasticity E = 1.1 x 10!!

What is the maximum allowable temperature at the outlet section of the heat exchanger on the combusted gas side?,"For each chosen section of the heat exchanger, the temperature of the tube at the wall depends on the bulk temperature of the pressurising gas (helium) at that section. Since the pressurising gas absorbs heat from the nozzle, the maximum temperature occurs at the outlet section of the heat exchanger. We assume the maximum allowable temperature at the outlet section of the heat exchanger on the combusted gas side to be T,,, = 778 K. "

A description and a list of these propellants are given in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.4.. "
"What type of propellant is noted for boiling violently when heated, with the exception of a specific fuel?","In particular, these feed systems have been used in large rocket vehicles whose propulsion systems are fed by pumps. They have been used especially for oxidisers, because most fuels tend to boil violently when heated. However, liquid hydrogen, which is a fuel, is an exception to this rule. Since the oxidiser vapour has usually a high molar mass, feed systems using evaporation of two propellants require a mass of pressurising gas for the oxidiser tank higher than the mass required by systems using inert gases, such as those described in Sect. "
What is the impact of removing storage vessels in feed systems utilizing the evaporation of dual propellants?,"3.3. This undesirable effect is counterbalanced by the elimination of storage vessels, because in feed systems using evaporation of two propellants the pressurising agent is stored as a liquid in the tank containing the main propellant.. "
What type of heat exchanger is designed with a helical-coil configuration as described in pump-fed rocket engine systems?,"Feed systems based on evaporation of two propellants used for pump-fed rocket engines take propellants tapped off downstream of the pump and vaporised in a heat exchanger. These propellants are then used to pressurise the main propellant tank from which they have been taken. There are many types of heat exchangers. One of them is the helical-coil type, which is described below. A functional scheme of this heat exchanger is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Wikimedia  [15], which illustrates a heat exchanger designed by US Army Colonel Scott S. Haraburda. |— EXCHANGER LENGTH —| ' i TUBE SHELL ‘ INLET INLET SHELL C_) TUBE OUTLET li OUTLET. "
"What feature distinguishes a helical-coil heat exchanger from other types, regarding the arrangement of the tube and the shell?","A helical-coil heat exchanger consists essentially of a shell (which is a container, usually cylindrical, designed to hold a fluid at a pressure much higher than the ambient pressure) and a tube wound around a core inside the shell. One of two fluids runs through the tube, from the inlet to the outlet section, and the other fluid flows over the tube, from the inlet to the outlet section of the shell, in order to transfer heat from one fluid to the other.. "
What type of heat exchanger is employed for vaporizing liquid cryogenic propellants in evaporated-propellant pressurization?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [2], illustrates another type (shell-and-tube) of heat exchanger used to vaporise liquid cryogenic propellants for evaporated-propellant pressurisation, as will be shown below."

What is the primary function of the device used in the J-2 rocket engine's heat exchange process?,"This particular heat exchanger, which has been used for the J-2 rocket engine, is a shell assembly, consisting of a duct, bellows, flanges, and coils. It is mounted in the turbine exhaust duct between the oxidiser turbine discharge manifold and the thrust chamber. It heats and expands gaseous helium for use in the third stage of the Saturn V rocket or converts liquid oxygen to gaseous oxygen for the second stage for maintaining pressurisation in the oxidiser tank of the vehicle. "
What gases can be tapped off or provided during engine operation?,"During engine operation, either liquid oxygen is tapped off the oxidiser high-pressure duct or helium is provided from the vehicle stage and routed to the heat exchanger coils [16].. "
What substance is vaporized by heat exchangers on Titan rockets to serve as a pressurizing agent?,Heat exchangers have also been employed on the Titan rockets to vaporise liquid nitrogen tetroxide to be used as the pressurising agent [2].
"What occurs in a heated liquid when its pressure falls below the saturation vapor pressure, leading to rapid boiling?","As has been shown above, evaporated-propellant pressurisation is successful with cryogenic propellants and also with the storable oxidiser nitrogen tetroxide, whose boiling point is 294.2 K. The simplest method of evaporated-propellant pressurisation is self-pressurisation (flash boiling) in a propellant tank during feed-out. By the way, flash boiling is the phenomenon which occurs in a heated liquid whose pressure is lower than the saturation vapour pressure of the liquid. When the pressure falls sufficiently below the saturation vapour pressure, then rapid boiling of the liquid can result.. "
What factors contribute to the high mass requirements of a pressurising agent in rocket propulsion systems?,"The self-pressurisation method is reliable, but the mass requirements of the pres- surising agent are high, because of its low temperature, and hence of its high density. In addition, pre-pressurisation from a separate system may be necessary to meet engine start requirements, as was the case with the Centaur rocket vehicle [2]. In this case, the vapour pressure of bulk propellants (hydrogen and oxygen) boiling in the tanks was used to provide the modest pressure required at the inlet of tank- mounted boost pumps. "
What method is used to achieve superheated vapour in systems with elevated pressure requirements?,"In systems requiring higher pressures, superheated vapour is obtained by passing the propellant through an engine heat exchanger or some other heat source, as will be shown below.. "
What factors contribute to optimal conditions in the ullage space regarding temperature management and structural compatibility?,"More favourable conditions exist in the ullage space when the pressurising agent is heated to the maximum temperature compatible with structural and propellant requirements, and when the temperature of the gas in the ullage space is stratified, that is, controlled by heating or cooling at the tank wall and upper bulkhead [2]."
What method was employed for pressurising the oxidiser tank in the second stage of the Saturn V rocket?,"In the S-II (meaning by this name the second stage of the Saturn V rocket), which used evaporated-propellant pressurisation in both oxidiser and fuel systems, propellant vapour was superheated to reduce the mass of gas required to the minimum. For main stage pressurisation, the oxidiser tank of the S-II was pressurised with warm gaseous oxygen (275 + 8 K at the maximum mixture ratio, and 250 + 8 K at low mixture ratio). "
What is the temperature range of the turbine outlet gas used as a heat source in the heat exchanger?,"As shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [2], the pressurising agent for the oxygen was obtained by extracting a portion of the liquid oxygen (at a temperature of approximately 94 K) leaving the discharge area of the pump and routing this fluid through the shell-and-tube heat exchanger, which has been shown in the preceding figure. The turbine outlet gas provided the heat source (at 598 + 30 K at the maximum mixture ratio, and 548 + 35 K at low mixture ratio) for the heat exchanger. "
What is the temperature range in Kelvin of the pressurising hydrogen at the maximum and low mixture ratios?,"Within the heat exchanger, the liquid oxygen was vaporised and then routed into a collector. From there, the gaseous oxygen was routed into the ullage space of the oxygen tank through a flow restrictor and gas distributor.  The fuel tank of the S-II was pressurised with gaseous hydrogen extracted from the cooling jacket of the thrust chamber, where this fluid was used as a coolant. The temperature of the pressurising hydrogen ranged from 111 + 11 K at the maximum mixture ratio to 72 + 17 K at low mixture ratio. "
How is hydrogen from the outboard engines directed toward the storage area in the system?,"The pressurising hydrogen was collected from the four outboard engines and was routed to the ullage space via the hydrogen-tank flow-control orifice and gas distributor.

What factors influence the mass flow rate required for propellant vaporisation and pressurisation in a rocket system?,"The mass flow rate of each propellant (oxidiser or fuel) required for vaporisation and pressurisation depends on the mass flow rate of that propellant at the pump inlet (or at the tank outlet) and also on the heat and mass transfer processes which occur in the propellant tanks. These processes, in  turn, depend on the temperature of the environment and on the temperature of the pressurising agent.. "

This propellant is less toxic and easier to handle than hydrazine, and has a specific impulse J, = 257 s, which is about 12% greater than the specific impulse of hydrazine, the latter being 7; = 230 s. It requires a catalyst bed preheating at a temperature exceeding 558 K to be ready for general operation [19].. "
What are the decomposition products of ammonium dinitramide when heated?,"Ammonium dinitramide, also known as ADN, whose chemical formula is NH,4N(NO>})o, is the ammonium (NH4*) salt of the dinitraminic acid (HN(NO2)2), and was invented in the 1970s in the former Soviet Union and independently  invented again in 1989 in the United States by SRI International. Gaseous ammonium dinitramide decomposes under heat into ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (NO), and nitric acid (HNO3). "

The tank contains 5.6 kg of LMP- 103S propellant. All of these components are of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) type used for hydrazine thrusters. "
What is the initial value of pressure in N/m² at 293 K before the propellant is consumed?,The tubes are 6 mm in diameter and are made of corrosion-resistant steel. All the components are welded to the tubes. The feed pressure decreases in proportion to the consumed propellant. The initial pressure is 2.2 x 10° N/m? at 293 K. This value decreases to 0.5 x 10° N/m? when all propellant is consumed. The thrust decreases from an initial value of | N to a final value of 0.25 N. The propellant and the gas (helium) under pressure are stored in the same tank and are separated by means of a flexible diaphragm. 
What component regulates the propellant flow to the thrust chamber during ignition?,"The gas acts on  this diaphragm by pushing the propellant through the system filter to the control valve, which controls the flow of propellant to the thruster. The thruster requires pre-heating before firing. When the firing command is given, the series redundant flow control valve opens and admits the propellant in the thrust chamber. There, the propellant decomposes and ignites in the pre-heated reactor bed. "

This feed system consists principally of one propellant tank with an internal flexible diaphragm, two service valves, two pressure transducers, one filter, one flow restrictor, one isolation latch valve, four 1- N thrusters for attitude control, and one 22-N primary divert thruster. "
What propellant pressure management method is employed in the thruster feed system?,"Each of these thrusters has a single-seat valve and a temperature sensor. The feed system operates in blow-down mode, which means that the pressure decreases in proportion to the amount of consumed propellant. The gas stored under pressure over the diaphragm is nitrogen. The system components used for AF-M315E are in many cases those used for hydrazine. The 1-N thrusters and the 22-N thruster require a pre-heating of the catalyst bed before firing. "
What are the components of propulsion systems that utilize refractory alloys to endure high flame temperatures?,"The power requirements relating to this pre-heating are high, due to the elevated minimum start temperature of the thrusters. These thrusters use the LCH-240 high-temperature long-life catalyst developed by Aerojet  Rocketdyne. The use of refractory alloys, necessary to withstand the high flame temperature of the AF-M315E propellant, is confined to the thrust chamber, the nozzle, and an upper thermal isolation structure. The other parts of the thrusters can be made of conventional alloys used for hydrazine thrusters [19].. "

What methods are used to generate the pressurising gas in a feed system involving combustion products?,"In a feed system using combustion products, the pressurising gas is obtained by combustion of propellants in a turbine gas generator, or by combustion in a solid- propellant gas generator, or by injection of a hypergolic fluid into the main propellant tank. This system has been used to supply pressurising gas in several small military vehicles, and also to pressurise the fuel tanks of the Titan stages. "
"What gas is employed as an oxidiser in the rocket engine described, and what is its chemical formula?","It has rarely been used, because the pressurising gas is chemically incompatible with the propellants, or has a temperature too high, or has condensible elements.

What is the combustion temperature of the gas generator in Kelvin when using a fuel-rich mixture ratio of o/f = 0.085?,"The gas generator uses the engine propellants to produce fuel-rich exhaust gases which drive the engine turbo-pumps. The combustion temperature in this gas generator is about 1256 K at a fuel-rich mixture ratio o/f = 0.085. The temperature at the turbine outlet is about 1183 K. The pressurising gas is tapped off at the turbine outlet, passed through a gas cooler, and then routed to the fuel tank. It is injected into the fuel tank within a temperature range of 361 K to 417 K. "
What component regulates the flow of gas downstream from the cooling unit in a pressurized system?,"The flow of the pressurising gas is controlled by a flow-control nozzle located downstream of the gas cooler [2].

What components are commonly found in a gas generator utilized for pressurizing rocket engine tanks?,"A gas generator like this can be employed to pressurise tanks of rocket engines using storable liquid propellants. This gas generator consists of two electrically-fired initiators (squibs), one charge of igniter pellets, some safety and arming devices, one regulator of the pressure-relief type, and two solid-propellant grains. There may also be, in some cases, a device to cool the hot gas produced. "
What materials are used for the housing and the main propellant tank in the gas generator system?,"The gas generator illustrated above is contained in an insulated housing made of steel. This housing, in turn, is contained in the main propellant tank, which is made of an aluminium alloy. The gas outlets are hermetically sealed by means of burst diaphragms which assure a safe storage of the solid propellant over long periods of time. At the proper moment, the propellant grains are ignited by the igniter pellets. "
What occurs when the maximum temperature is surpassed during combustion in relation to excess gases?,"The gases generated by the combustion process pressurise the main propellants for the duration of the propellant grains. Such grains are designed to produce the desired pressures and flow rates within a given range of temperature. In case of the upper limit of temperature being exceeded, a regulator discharges overboard the excess gases.. "
What are the two types of solid-propellant gas generators described with respect to cooling mechanisms and their functionalities?,"Some types of solid-propellant gas generators used for feed systems are briefly described below. The following figure illustrates two solid-propellant gas generators, one of which without cooling and the other with a solid coolant.  Solid propellant Pressure-relief type with igniter | regulator or orifice ai J propellant tank Filter Vent Solid propellant Pressure-relief with igniter Solid coolant | type regulator ~ | propellant tank Filter Vent. "
What components are included in the gas generator for short-term operation?,"The gas generator shown in the upper part of the preceding figure consists of a solid-propellant charge with igniter, a filter, and a hot-gas regulator or an orifice. This type of gas generator can be used only for short periods of time. When the solid propellant is ignited, the hot gases are passed through the filter, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks. The regulator or the orifice mentioned above dumps overboard the excess gas, and therefore a vent line must be present for this purpose.. "
What components are involved in the cooling process of hot gases generated by igniting a solid-propellant charge?,"The gas generator shown in the lower part of the preceding figure consists of a solid-propellant charge with igniter, a sublimating solid coolant, a filter, and a regulator. When the solid propellant is ignited, the hot gases are cooled by passing through a solid material which decomposes or sublimates. This cooling process generates additional gases. The mixture of gases generated in this manner is passed through the filter, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks.. "
What is the flame temperature of ammonium nitrate when used as a solid propellant in a gas generator?,"Huzel and Huang [3] describe a gas generator using ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) as the solid propellant, which has a flame temperature of about 1544 K. The ammo- nium nitrate is used with a solid coolant made of oxalic acid (HOOCCOOH or (COOH):) compressed into pellets. Oxalic acid decomposes endothermically, at a temperature above 394 K, and produces a mixture of gases consisting of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O). "
What temperature can be achieved by altering the balance between the propellant and the coolant?,"The desired temperature is obtained by adjusting the ratio of the propellant to the coolant. By so doing, a temperature of 478 K has been reached [3].. "
What type of cooling pack is utilized in the illustrated solid-propellant gas generator?,The following figure illustrates a solid-propellant gas generator having an azide cooling pack.
What is the temperature at which sodium azide decomposes into nitrogen and sodium particles?,"Solid propellant Azidepack Cyclone charge separator inp type regulator Filter propellant tanks Metallic particles  In this gas generator, the hot gas resulting from the combustion of a solid propellant is cooled by passing through an azide material. An example of this material is sodium azide (NaN;), which decomposes after being heated at or above approximately 573 K into gaseous nitrogen (N2) and sodium (Na) particles, as follows 2NaN3 — 2Na+ 3N2. "
What is the temperature in Kelvin at which gaseous nitrogen is produced in a gas generator?,"These particles are removed when the gas containing them passes through a cyclone separator. The gas coming from this separator is filtered to remove further particles, regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks. A gas generator like this has made it possible to obtain gaseous nitrogen at a temperature of about 590 K [3]."
What is the primary function of a cyclone separator in separating components from a mixed fluid?,"Generally speaking, a cyclone separator is a device which removes solid particles from a gaseous or liquid stream without using filters. The solid particles are removed because they are denser than the other molecules of the stream. A fluid mixed with solid particles enters tangentially in a cyclone, which consists of a cylindrical body, a conical outlet for the particles, and a top axial pipe outlet for the clean fluid. "
What occurs to high-density particles within a conical device subjected to centrifugal force?,"An outer vortex is created due to the centrifugal force applied to the molecules, and the fluid circles down to the bottom end of the cone. Particles of high density are pushed against the wall and separated from the fluid. In the conical part, the fluid reverses the direction of its motion, goes up via the central part of the cyclone (inner vortex), and exits on the top by the fluid outlet pipe. The solid particles travel down the wall, and are collected into a receptacle at the bottom of the conical part. This device is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of the US Government [25].. "
What components are included in a high-pressure helium storage system used for propulsion?,"Still another type of solid-propellant gas generator is the helium system with solid-propellant gas generator heating. This system consists of a spherical vessel storing helium at high pressure, a solid-propellant gas generator mounted inside this vessel, a filter, and a pressure regulator, as shown in the following figure.  propellant Filter ss [ _]Regulator To main propellant tanks"
"What type of gas is expanded due to heat generated by a solid-propellant system, and what is the purpose of this expansion?","This solid-propellant gas generator provides heat, which causes the helium to expand, and also additional pressurising gas. This system requires a large vessel to store the solid propellant and the helium at high pressure."
What type of control mechanisms are typically employed to manage liquid-propellant gas-generators effectively?,3.7 Control Systems for Liquid-Propellant Gas Generators
What design considerations are essential for liquid-propellant gas generators to ensure compatibility and prevent issues with pressurising gases?,"As has been shown in Sect. 3.6, liquid-propellant gas generators require a careful design, in order to avoid problems concerning the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas with the propellants, or the temperature of this gas, or the presence of condensible elements into it. These problems can be solved by using control systems, which are described in the present paragraph."
What characteristic of hydrazine mono-propellant allows for satisfactory decomposition without creating deposits that affect heat exchanger performance?,"As far as the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas is concerned, hydrazine mono-propellant is considered satisfactory in view of the chemical characteristics and the molar masses of the gases (nitrogen and hydrogen) resulting from its decom- position in the presence of a catalyst. These gases contain no carbon, and therefore generate no deposits which could lower the performance of a heat exchanger. "
How can the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio influence the compatibility of gases generated by liquid propellants in a gas generator?,"In case of gas generators using a combination of two liquid propellants, the gases generated by them can be made chemically compatible with the propellants by varying the value of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio o/f with respect to the stoichiometric value. By so doing, the same combination of propellants can be used to generate a pressurising gas compatible with both the oxidiser and the fuel. "
What type of propellant combination was utilized in the Titan II ICBM and Titan space launch vehicles?,"An example is given by the hyper- golic combination of nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozine 50, which was used for the first and second stages of the Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile and Titan space  launch vehicles [26]. As has been shown in Sect. 3.6, the gas generator of the Titan engine uses the engine propellants to produce fuel-rich exhaust gases which drive the engine turbo-pumps.. "
What method can be used to reduce combustion temperature by altering the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio?,"As far as the temperature of the pressurising gas is concerned, more than one option can be chosen to assure compatibility. One of such options consists in varying of the value of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio to lower the combustion temperature, as has been shown above. Another option consists in injecting a non-reacting liquid into the gas generator, in order to subtract heat from the combusted gas in the evaporation of this liquid. "
What method can be utilized to reduce the temperature of gas involving interaction with a liquid substance?,"A third option consists in cooling the gas by means of a heat exchanger, through which the gas flows with one of the liquid propellants. Of course, this option can be chosen only when the propellant can safely absorb the heat coming from the combusted gas.. "
What combustion temperature is necessary to achieve low molar mass in combustion products?,"The presence of condensible elements into the combusted gas can be avoided by regulating the combustion temperature, as will be shown below. In order for the molar mass of the combusted gas to be low, the combustion temperature of a fuel-rich mixture should reach a value (approximately 811 K) sufficient to break the bonds of the complex molecules of the combustion products and give rise to substances having low-mass molecules. "
What is the minimum combustion temperature required to prevent condensation of high molar mass gas molecules during combustion?,"Of course, this result can be obtained only when the fuel injected in excess into the gas generator does not reduce the combustion temperature below about 811 K. This is because, when the temperature is too low, some molecules of the combusted gas have a high molar mass, and these molecules are subject to condense.. "
"What type of control system utilizes a singular gas generator to pressurize both fuel and oxidizer tanks, incorporating a method for injection cooling?","Some typical control systems used for liquid-propellant gas generators are briefly described below.One of these control systems uses a single gas generator, which provides gas under pressure to both the fuel tank and the oxidiser tank, with injection cooling. A scheme of this system is shown in the following figure."
What is the role of gaseous helium in the system described in the propulsion mechanism?,"| Regulator (-) or second Propellant propellant () Gas generator To main propellant tanks  The liquid substances employed may be either a mono-propellant and an inert coolant or a combination of two propellants. In the second case, the cooling is obtained by injecting the second propellant in excess with respect to the quantity necessary for the stoichiometric mixture ratio. The mono-propellant and the coolant or the two propellants are kept under pressure by means of gaseous helium stored at a high pressure in a vessel. "
What factors must be investigated when selecting a combination of liquid substances for compatibility with propellants and pressurising gases?,"Downstream of this vessel, the pressure is kept to the desired value by using valves and a pressure regulator. This system makes it possible to cool the gas coming from the gas generator to a temperature compatible with the propellants. A combination of liquid substances must be studied carefully, in order to satisfy not only the temperature requirement, but also the other requirements, and in particular the one concerning the chemical compatibility of the pressurising gas with both of the propellants. To this regard, fuel-rich gases have been found apt to pressurise storable oxidisers. Examples of such oxidisers are given in [3].. "
What components are utilized in a system that employs one gas generator and a heat exchanger for propellant combination?,"Another of these control systems uses a single gas generator and a heat exchanger, as shown in the following scheme, which refers to the case of a gas generator using a combination of two propellants.| Regulator (=) (=) propellant C) Gas generator cas"
What is the purpose of heated helium in the system described?,"The hot gas coming from the gas generator is directed to a heat exchanger, in order to transfer heat to the cold helium. The helium expands after being heated and is used to pressurise the tank of the main oxidiser. The gas cooled through the gas generator is used to pressurise the tank of the main fuel.  Still another of these control systems uses a double gas generator, which provides gas under pressure to both the fuel tank and the oxidiser tank, with injection cooling. "
Describe the role of the helium in the system as it relates to the gas generators.,"A scheme of this system is shown in the following figure. [ Regulator Auxiliary Auxiliary oxidiser fuel tank tank Lo Oxidiser-rich ‘- C) Fuel-rich gas generator gas generator Tomain To main oxidiser fuel tank tank In this system, the fuel and the oxidiser are fed to two gas generators by using the pressure exerted by the helium. One of the gas generators operates with injection of excess oxidiser, and produces a cool, oxidiser-rich gas, which is used to pressurise the main oxidiser tank. "
What temperatures can be achieved in the gas produced by one of the gas generators operating with excess fuel?,"The other gas generator operates with injection of excess fuel, and produces a cool, fuel-rich gas, which is used to pressurise the main fuel tank. This system requires a balance in the output of the two gas generators and also a pressure control in both of the main propellant tanks. By so doing, temperatures as low as 589 K have been reached in the gas generated [3]. 3.8 Feed Systems Using Direct Injection into the Main Propellant Tanks In these systems, a small quantity of oxidiser is injected directly into the main tank containing the fuel, and a small quantity of fuel is injected directly into the main tank containing the oxidiser.

The serial version takes advantage of the possibility of exerting a lower pressure in one of the two main propellant tanks than in the other. "

What are the four criteria important for selecting a system utilizing pressurized gases according to Huzel and Huang?,3.9 Choice of a Feed System Using Gases Under PressureThe choice of one of another system which uses gases stored under pressure is usually the result of a preliminary study. Huzel and Huang [3] have suggested four criteria to be considered in this study. They are:e chemical compatibility of the propellants with the materials;  e system reliability; and e system performance.
"What are the considerations for engine start, propellant storage, and pressure control within the ullage space in mission planning?","The mission requirements concern the possibility of using storable propellants, the need to start the engine one or more times, and the capability of controlling the values of pressure in the ullage space."
What factors are essential to consider regarding the interaction between propellants and container materials in terms of chemical compatibility?,"The chemical compatibility of the propellants with the materials concern the absence of reactivity between the propellants and the materials of which their containers are made, the absence of condensible or soluble particles in the combusted gas, and the maintenance of a desired value of temperature in the gas under pressure."
What factors influence the reliability evaluation of components in a complex system?,"The system reliability depends on the degree of complexity of the system, on the number of its failure modes, and on the number of its components. The reliability of each component, in turn, is to be evaluated considering its time of development and the funds available. To this regard, components expected to require greater efforts of development to reach desirable degrees of reliability are gas generators, heat exchangers forming an integral part of the thrust chamber, storage vessels subject to high pressures, and pipes and regulators for gases at high temperatures.. "
How does the total mass of a rocket vehicle at burnout influence the performance of a gas pressurisation system?,"The system performance depends on the gross mass of the gas stored for pressuri- sation, which in turn depends on its molar mass and also on the mass of the system of pressurisation. The latter mass is part of the mass of the rocket vehicle at burnout. References"

"
What is the role of turbines in a liquid-propellant rocket engine that utilizes turbo-pumps?,"In a liquid-propellant rocket engine fed by turbo-pumps, one or more turbines are used to drive pumps. The pumps, in turn, are used to increase the pressures of the liquid propellants above the values of storage in the tanks, for the purpose of injecting the propellants at high pressures into the main combustion chamber. In other words, the pumps take the liquid propellants from their tanks at low pressures, and supply them to the main combustion chamber at the required mass flow rates and injection pressures.. "
What are the advantages of using turbo-pump feed systems compared to pressurized gas feed systems in terms of mass and performance?,"As has been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.7, the energy supplied to a turbine is provided by the expansion of a compressed gas, which is usually a mixture of the propellants burned in the engine [1]. The advantages offered by feed systems using turbo-pumps over feed systems using gases stored under pressure are lower mass and higher performance."
What are the key components involved in a feed system that utilizes turbo-pumps?,A feed system using turbo-pumps consists of the following components:

What are the three types of turbo-pumps used in liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"Springer Aerospace Technology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54704-2_4  4.2 Pumps for Propellants In general terms, a pump is a machine which imparts energy to a fluid. In specific terms, a turbo-pump for a liquid-propellant rocket engine is a turbine-driven roto- dynamic pump, that is, a particular type of pump in which the motion of a rotating element converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy supplied to each of the propellants (fuel and oxidiser) to be injected under high pressure into the combus- tion chamber of the engine. There are three types of turbo-pumps: axial-flow pumps, centrifugal-flow pumps, and mixed-flow pumps. They are described below.. "
What are the key components of an axial-flow pump and how do they interact to maintain small clearances during operation?,"According to the definition given by Scheer et al. [2], an axial-flow pump consists of a set of discs or a cylinder carrying aerofoil-shaped blades on the periphery, which rotates at high speed within a casing or housing which contains fixed blades (stator vanes) placed between the rotor blades. Small clearances at the blade tips and between rotor blades and stator vanes are maintained under all operating conditions. "
What type of pumps operate effectively with low-density fluids and require multiple compression stages to achieve pressure increases?,"The flow is nearly parallel to the pump shaft, and head rise (defined below) is produced by summation of increases in pressure produced as the fluid traverses each set (stage) of rotor blades and stator vanes. Axial-flow pumps have small diameters but give modest pressure increases. Although multiple compression stages are needed, axial- flow pumps work well with low-density fluids. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [2], is a cross-sectional view of the axial-flow Mark 15-fuel (liquid hydrogen) turbo-pump used for the J-2 engine.. "

What is the primary function of the device that imparts energy to a fluid using centrifugal force within an enclosed casing?,"rotor (impeller) shaped so as to sweep the fluid roughly at right angles outward from  the pump shaft. This action imparts a high spiral velocity to the fluid. Much of this velocity is converted to pressure increase by the diffuser which surrounds the impeller and collects the fluid. The rotating blades are typically enclosed within a casing, and are used to impart energy to a fluid through centrifugal force. "
What are the main components of a centrifugal-flow pump that contribute to its operation and support its rotating element?,"A centrifugal-flow pump has two principal parts: (1) a rotating element, which includes the impeller and the shaft; and (2) a fixed element, which is made up of a casing (volute), a stuffing box to prevent the pumped fluid from coming out of the volute casing from the location of the shaft, and bearings, which absorb the radial and axial loads transmitted through the shaft, keep the rotating element in position and in correct alignment with the fixed element, and permit the shaft to rotate with the least possible amount of friction. "
"What type of pump is more effective for high-density fluids compared to its counterpart, even though it necessitates larger diameters for lighter fluids?","Centrifugal-flow pumps are far more powerful than axial-flow pumps for high-density fluids, but require large diameters for low-density fluids. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3] is a cross-sectional view of a typical centrifugal-flow pump.

What is the primary role of the axial inlet component of a pump rotor concerning cavitation prevention?,"The inducer, shown in the preceding figures, is the axial inlet portion of the pump rotor, and has the function of raising the inlet head (see below) by an amount sufficient to preclude cavitation (see below) in the following stage [4]."
What is the design orientation of the vanes on a typical unshrouded liquid-hydrogen centrifugal-flow pump impeller?,"The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [5], shows a typical unshrouded (that is, non-covered) impeller of a liquid-hydrogen centrifugal-flow pump. This particular impeller has vanes directed radially at the outlet."
What type of impeller does a mixed-flow pump utilize to transport fluid between axial and radial directions?,"Mixed-flow pumps are a compromise between axial-flow and centrifugal-flow pumps. A mixed-flow pump is similar to a centrifugal pump, but has a mixed-flow impeller, that is, an impeller which transports the fluid diagonally, halfway between the axial direction and the radial direction. A mixed-flow pump pushes the fluid out away from the pump shaft. Pressure is developed in the pump partly by centrifugal force and partly by the lifting action of the mixed-flow impeller. "
Which type of turbo-pump is most commonly used for pumping liquid hydrogen based on temperature and density considerations?,"Of the three types (axial-flow, centrifugal-flow, and mixed-flow) of turbo-pumps described above, those of the centrifugal-flow type are the most frequently used. However, when the pumped fluid is liquid hydrogen, multistage axial-flow turbo-pumps are frequently used, due to the lowest temperature and density of this fluid. Three impellers used for respec- tively centrifugal-flow, axial-flow, and mixed-flow pumps are illustrated sequentially, from left to right, in the following figure, which is re-drawn from [6]. "

[7] is the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth, and v (m/s) is the velocity of the fluid in the chosen point along a stream line.. "
"What phenomenon occurs when the static pressure of a liquid falls below its vapour pressure, leading to bubble formation and potential damage in pumps?",Care must be taken to avoid cavitation in rotodynamic pumps. Cavitation is the spontaneous formation and accumulation of vapour bubbles in a flowing liquid as its static pressure drops below its vapour pressure. The burst or collapse of the bubbles gives rise to shock waves of high energy inside the liquid. The shock waves cause erosion and serious damage to the impeller and to the housing of a pump. 
What factors must be considered to prevent cavitation in centrifugal pumps?,"The wreckage, due to cavitation, of the impeller of a centrifugal-flow pump is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Milan, through Wikimedia [8].  . 7 wy —— \ f ty 4 of : wee > fi For the purpose of avoiding cavitation in a pump, it is necessary to be careful about. "
What phenomenon is likely to occur at a pump's inlet when it is positioned significantly above the liquid supply reservoir?,"the value taken by a quantity called available Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH 4), as will be shown below. Cavitation is likely to occur on the inlet side of a pump, particularly when the pump is situated at a level well above the surface of the liquid in the supply reservoir. By writing the equation of energy, in steady conditions, between the surface of the liquid in the supply reservoir (point 2) and the inlet flange of the pump (point 1), there results. "
What symbol represents the difference in elevation between the liquid's surface in a reservoir and a pump's inlet flange?,"P80 Pg 280 where Psu (N/m?) is the absolute pressure at the surface of the liquid in the reservoir, p (kg/m?) is the density in all points of the liquid at the operating temperature, go = 9.80665 m/s? is the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth, Az = Z2 — Z1 (m) is the difference of elevation between the surface of the liquid in the reservoir and the inlet flange of the pump, AH; (m) is the head loss due to friction in the suction line, p; (N/m?) is the absolute pressure in the liquid at the inlet flange of the pump, and v; (m/s) is the velocity of the liquid at the inlet flange of the pump. The preceding equation may be re-written as follows. "
What condition must be maintained at the impeller to prevent the occurrence of cavitation?,"In order for cavitation not to occur at the impeller, the following condition must"
What parameters are needed to compute head loss in a suction line using the Darcy-Weisbach equation?,"be satisfied  Pi > Pv where p, (N/m?) is the vapour pressure of the liquid at the given temperature. The head loss AH; (m), due to the friction in the suction line, can be computed by means of the Darcy-Weisbach equation (see Chap. 2, Sect. 2.5), as follows Lyw AH; = fo—==— ly = fo J 2% where fp, L (m), and d (m) are respectively the dimensionless Darcy friction factor, the length, and the hydraulic diameter of the suction line, and v (m/s) is the mean velocity of the liquid in this line. "
What does the term Az refer to when the impeller's center is above the fluid being pumped?,"The available Net Positive Suction Head NPSH 4 (m) is defined as follows Psurf vp Py NPSH 4 = —— + Az — AHy + —— — — 80 280 p80 where Az (m) is positive and is called suction head when the centre of the impeller is below the level of the fluid being pumped, and is negative and is called suction lift when the centre of the impeller is above the level of the fluid being pumped. The equation written above, whose term v?/(2go) is often neglected, makes it possible to calculate the NPSH available (VPSH,) at the inlet flange of a pump. "
What condition must be fulfilled regarding the available and required NPSH for optimal pump performance?,"The curves determined experimentally by the manufacturer of a given pump (see, for example, [9, 10]) specify the NPSH required (VPSH) in the operating conditions. For good operation of a pump, the following condition must be satisfied, with a margin of at least 1 m: NPSH, > NPSHR In the particular case of a pump for a rocket engine, the NPSH available (VPSH 4) is the difference, at the pump inlet, between the head due to the total fluid pressure and the head due to the propellant vapour pressure [11], as follows 12 i + 5 PV; — Py NPSH, = Pit 3PVi — Pv P80 The critical value of the NPSH pr, under which cavitation occurs at the pump inlet, is usually taken as the value for which the head rise is 2% less than the non-cavitation value [12]. "
What methods can be employed when a rocket engine's value does not fulfill its design specifications?,"In case of a value insufficient to meet the design requirements for a rocket engine, the following methods have been used: (1) increasing the pressure in the tank; (2) decreasing the design speed of the pump; and . "
What effect does increasing the diameter of a pump inlet have on the relationship between meridian velocity and tangential velocity at the blade tip?,"(3) re-designing the pump inlet by increasing the diameter and lowering the flow coefficient 9} = Cm1/u;, where C,,; (m/s) is the meridian velocity of the fluid at the impeller inlet, and u, (m/s) is the tangential velocity of the blade at the inlet tip."
What factors must be considered in the design of a rocket engine pump besides NPSH values?,"The first method increases the NPSH available, but also increases the wall thick- ness and the mass of the tank. The second method decreases the NPSH required, but also decreases the pump efficiency and increases the turbo-pump mass. The third method decreases the NPSH required, but can decrease the pump efficiency [12]. Further parameters, whose values have to be taken into account in the design of a pump for a rocket engine, are pump head coefficient, pump specific speed, suction specific speed, and Thoma’s cavitation factor. They are defined below.. "
"What is the symbolic representation for the non-dimensional pump head coefficient, and which parameters does it depend on?","The non-dimensional pump head coefficient is defined as followsve s0dH uy where AH (m) is the head rise at the best efficiency point (BEP), u2 (m/s) is the tangential velocity of the blade at the tip of the impeller, and go (m/s?) is the gravi- tational acceleration of the Earth. The values of y for centrifugal-flow pumps vary from approximately 0.35 to more than 0.70 [3]."
What is the significance of the non-dimensional parameter known as pump specific speed N in pump performance evaluation?,"Pump specific speed N is another non-dimensional parameter, defined as follows"
What is the specific speed range for axial-flow pump stages used in rocket engines?,"where w (rad/s) is the angular velocity of the shaft, and q (m3/s) and AH (m) are respectively the volume flow rate and the head rise at the BEP. Axial-flow pump stages for rocket engines have specific speeds N ranging from approximately 1.17 to 4.02. It should be noted that these are stage characteristics, and that considerable difference occurs when the entire pump is examined [2]. Current flight-proven centrifugal-flow pumps range from 0.16 to 0.77 in specific speed. The specific speed of the Mark-14 pump for the Atlas vehicle has reached the value of 1.1 [3].. "
What is the definition of suction specific speed S in the context of dimensional analysis?,"Suction specific speed S is also a non-dimensional parameter, defined as follows"
What is the maximum suction specific speed for rocket pumps based on the given information?,where g (m*/s) and NPSH x (m) are respectively the volume flow rate and the head rise at the BEP. The suction specific speed is used as an index for cavitation performance of pumps. Rocket pumps operate up to a suction specific speed of about 18.3 [13]. The design suction specific speed of a low-pressure oxidiser pump inducer used in the Space Shuttle main engine is 25.6 [13]. 
What is the angular velocity of the shaft in radians per second for the liquid-hydrogen turbo-pump used in the M-1 rocket engine?,"For example, the liquid-hydrogen turbo-pump for the M-1 rocket engine (burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen) is a ten-stage, axial-flow pump. For this pump, the angular velocity of the shaft is @ = 1385 rad/s, the volume flow rate of the liquid hydrogen is g = 3.931 m?/s, and the design value of the Net Positive Suction Head is NPSHr = 101.5 m [14]. Introducing these values and go = 9.807 m/s? in the preceding equation yields. "
What is the term for a non-dimensional parameter associated with Thoma's cavitation factor in fluid dynamics?,"1385 x 3.9312 S= 1385. 3.9317 = 155 (9.807 x 101.5)4Thoma’s cavitation factor oy is another non-dimensional parameter, defined as"
What factor is utilized to determine the potential occurrence of cavitation in a pump by comparing actual and critical values?,"where p} — p7 (N/m’) is the total pressure rise across the pump, and p, (N/m?) is the vapour pressure of the fluid at the operating temperature. Thoma’s cavitation factor is used to ascertain whether cavitation is, or is not, occurring in a pump. For this purpose, the actual value of o ry is compared with a critical value (o ry), for a given pump. When o7y is lower than (0 7y;),,, cavitation may occur. "
"What type of turbine is primarily used to drive pumps for propellants, based on the direction of gas flow?","The value of (074 )er may be either computed through empirical relations or determined experimentally. 4.3, Turbines Driving the Pumps A turbine driving a pump for propellants is a mechanical device which extracts energy from a moving gas. This energy is used to drive the pump. Turbines used for this purpose are, with a few exceptions, of the axial type, meaning by this, that the gas flow strikes the rotor in a direction parallel to the shaft axis.. "
What type of fuel is utilized by the high-pressure turbine in the J-2 engines for the Saturn S-II and S-IVB stages?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [15], illustrates (left) the Mark 15-fuel (liquid hydrogen) turbine, and (right) the Mark 15-oxidiser (liquid oxygen) turbine, both of which are installed in the J-2 engine.  \\ Radial P= /\ I! a | retaining pin ML seeneNy V7 Fens Soy] k By Positioning —L | (w { We X manifold 1 ul Dlaphrage - 6 : i// Ca Prem SD See at wah P ELEL ELLE LE KES - — Disk aad Se ls] VI Cli abe aN Pd {\\ Vel Circunferential IN 9 Neat) ey © = BEDS 1d 12 a a ' Cops ki Honeycomb Cai!

What component is responsible for sealing at the radial joint in the low-pressure turbine system?,The turbine exhaust gas from this unit is used subsequently as working fluid in the low-pressure Mark 15-oxidiser turbine. The Mark 15-fuel is mounted to the turbo-pump with a short- coupled diaphragm containing radial pins for axial positioning. A circumferential “hat” section and U-diaphragm perform the sealing function at the radial joint. Honeycomb rotor tip seals are carried by the stator ring and retainer. 
What design feature allows the low-pressure turbine to operate without requiring multiple welded connections between its torus and nozzle components?,"Turbine torque transmission and disc retention are accomplished with a stud drive. The Mark 15- oxidiser is the low-pressure turbine in the series-installed turbines for the J-2 engines. This turbine uses exhaust gas from the Mark 15-fuel turbine as working fluid, and incorporates a low-pressure torus-and-shroud configuration which does not require the numerous welds of a separate torus and nozzle. "
What are the two main components of a gas turbine that interact directly with the flowing gas to generate motion?,"Radially installed roll pins retain the manifold at the outer diameter, and a conventional diaphragm at the inner diameter provides a seal at that juncture [15]. Generally speaking, the main parts of a gas turbine are: © arow of static vanes, called nozzles or stators, which guide the gas to flow in the desired direction at the desired velocity; e the rotor, which is the moving part of a turbine and has blades attached to it by means of dove-tail or fir-tree joints; e the shaft, to which the rotor is keyed; e the blades, on which the flowing gas impinges and causes the rotor to turn; and e the casing, which is the outer part which covers the turbine and contains the rotor, the shaft, and the blades. . "
What type of joint is utilized to connect a turbine blade to a rotor in aerospace applications?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [16], shows how a turbine blade is attached to a rotor by means of a fir-tree joint.y- AIRFOIL PRESSURE AIRFOIL / SIDE / TANG) AIRFOIL Jf / SUCTION / | py sve \ J, f° Af 7~ AIRFOIL LEADING | SPAN EDGE LENGTH ~~ UPPER } y LOBE ~ RA FIRTREE CROSS-SECTION : FY ~— SHANK PLATFORM ~"
What are the two main categories of turbines used in engineering applications?,There are two principal types of turbines: impulse turbines and reaction turbines.
What role do the blades play in transforming gas dynamics within an impulse turbine?,"In an impulse turbine, the gas flows through the nozzle and impinges on the moving blades of the rotor. These blades convert the kinetic energy of the gas flow into mechanical energy. They also direct the gas flow either to the next stage, in case of a multi-stage turbine, or to the exhaust, in case of a single-stage turbine. There is no expansion or pressure drop of the gas over the blades. The area of passage through the blades remains constant. An impulse turbine can have one or more stages.. "
What occurs to the gas as it passes through the stationary and rotating components of a specific type of turbine?,"In a reaction turbine, the gas flows firstly through the fixed blades of a stator and then through the moving blades of a rotor. A pressure drop takes place in the stator blades and also in the rotor blades. The area of passage through the blades varies continuously, in order to allow the gas to expand continuously over the blades. A reaction turbine is usually multi-stage. "
"Describe the configuration and components of a single-stage, single-rotor impulse turbine used in rocket engine pump systems.","The types of turbine used to drive pumps of rocket engines are briefly described below. A single-stage, single-rotor impulse turbine has a single rotor, which is a revolving disc having a row of blades attached to its circumference. The following figure, re-drawn from [17], shows the nozzles and the rotor blades of a single-stage, single-rotor impulse turbine."
What component transfers energy to the rotor blades in a gas turbine system?,Nozzle | r. Rotor blade Hot gas ——»- | —— Exhaust Shaft. «— Disc
"How does the transformation of pressure energy occur in the nozzles, and what is the resulting effect on the static pressure of the gas?","The hot gas flows to the rotor through the nozzles. The cross-sectional area of each nozzle increases gradually towards the mouth, in order for the gas to expand and gain velocity. The pressure drop occurs in the nozzles, and the velocity drop occurs on the rotor blades. In the nozzles, the pressure energy (pressure head) possessed by the gas is converted into kinetic energy (velocity head), and therefore the static pressure of the gas decreases. "
What energy transformation occurs when gas flow strikes rotor blades in a turbine?,"When the gas flow impinges on the blades of the rotor, the kinetic energy possessed by the gas is imparted to the rotor, and is converted into energy of rotation. The following figure, re-drawn from [18], shows how the gas pressure and velocity vary in a single-stage, single-rotor impulse turbine. In this figure, N and R indicate respectively a nozzle and a rotor blade. . "
Why is a single-stage turbine unsuitable for applications involving significant pressure drops?,"Incase of a large pressure drop, it is practically impossible to use a turbine having only one stage. This is because a single-stage turbine having a large pressure drop has also a high peripheral velocity U = wr (m/s), where @ (rad/s) is the angular velocity, and r (m) is the radius of the rotor. Therefore, turbines operating with a large pressure drop have more than one stage, as will be shown below.. "
What are the two primary classifications of compounded impulse turbines based on their method of absorbing gas energy?,"The compounding of impulse turbines is obtained by using more than one set of nozzles, blades, and rotors in a series. The moving blades are keyed to a common shaft. By so doing, either the gas velocity or the gas pressure is absorbed by the turbine in stages.The two main types of compounded impulse turbines are: © velocity-compounded impulse turbines; and © pressure-compounded impulse turbines."
What was the main issue that led to the development of a velocity-compounded impulse turbine by Curtis?,"A velocity-compounded impulse turbine was first proposed by Curtis to solve the problem of the high rotational speed of a single-stage impulse turbine used in a gas flow of high pressure and temperature. With reference to the following figure, re-drawn from [18], in a velocity-compounded impulse turbine, the two rings R; and R» of moving blades are separated by a ring F of fixed vanes.  ' \ ! ' ' ! ‘ 1 ' ' ! ' 1 ' t ' H ' { +— Velocity ! ' f ' a ! Ld —» Axial direction The moving blades are keyed to the turbine shaft, and the fixed vanes are fixed to the casing. "
How does the pressure energy of gas change as it flows through the nozzles before reaching the moving blades?,"The high-pressure gas expands in the nozzles N first. The nozzles convert the pressure energy of the gas flow into kinetic energy. The pressure drop occurs in the nozzles. Downstream of the nozzles, the pressure remains constant. This high- velocity flow is directed from the nozzles N on to the first ring R; of moving blades. The gas, when flowing over the moving blades of Rj, imparts some of its momentum to them and loses some velocity. "
What happens to the kinetic energy of gas as it moves from the first set of moving blades to the subsequent fixed vanes?,"Only a part of the kinetic energy lost by the gas is absorbed by the moving blades of Rj, and therefore the gas possesses residual kinetic energy at the moment of being exhausted on to the next ring F of fixed vanes. The function of the fixed vanes F is to redirect the flow coming from the first ring R; of moving blades to the second ring R2 of moving blades. There is very little change in the velocity of the gas as it passes through the fixed vanes. "
What are the main disadvantages of using a velocity-compounded turbine in terms of nozzle design and gas velocity effects?,"The gas then enters the second ring R2 of moving blades. This process may be repeated until practically all the kinetic energy possessed by the gas has been absorbed by the moving blades of the rotors. Velocity-compounded turbines have the following disadvantages: © since there is only one drop of pressure in all the stages, then the nozzles require a careful design and an expensive manufacturing, because they have to be of the converging-diverging type in order for the velocity of the gas to be supersonic; and e the high velocity of the gas at the exit section of the nozzles implies high cascade losses, and shock waves are generated in the supersonic flow.  In order to avoid these disadvantages, the total pressure drop is divided into a. "
What type of velocity is exhibited by gas flowing through nozzles in a pressure-compounded turbine?,"series of stages. Since the pressure drop is lower in each stage, then the gas flows at subsonic velocity in the nozzles. With reference to the following figure, re-drawn from [18], a pressure-compounded (or Rateau) impulse turbine has alternate rows of nozzles N and moving blades R."
"Describe the process of gas movement through the components of a turbine involving nozzles and moving blades, focusing on pressure and velocity changes.","The nozzles are fitted to the casing, and the moving blades are keyed to the shaft. In this type of turbine, the gas expands by degrees when passing through each row of nozzles. The gas coming from the gas generator is fed to the first row N; of nozzles, where it loses a part of its pressure and increases its velocity. Then, the gas passes through the first row R; of moving blades, where it loses velocity at a constant pressure. "
What occurs to the pressure and velocity of gas as it passes through the second row of nozzles in a turbine?,"Then, the gas passes through the second row No of nozzles, where it loses a further part of its pressure and increases its velocity. Then, the gas is fed to the second row R» of moving blades, where it loses velocity at a constant pressure. This process may be repeated until practically all the kinetic energy possessed by the gas has been absorbed by the moving blades. In particular, the preceding figure shows how the gas pressure and velocity vary in a two-stage, pressure-compounded impulse turbine.. "
"In a two-stage reaction turbine, how does the pressure drop in each stage compare to that in an impulse turbine?","In a multi-stage reaction (or Parsons) turbine, the gas pressure decreases continu- ally over the rings of the fixed vanes (F}, Fo, ...) and also over the rings of the moving blades (Ry, Ro, ...), as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [18], which illus- trates a two-stage reaction turbine and the variation of pressure and velocity of the gas through the stages of a reaction turbine.  fa) nlf) a ' ' ' i] ’ ' f \ ' ' 1 Hq : 1 ' ' 1 7 : ! ' H ' ' : ' ' i 1 1 ' H Velocity ; i 1 Pressure ‘» Axial direction In each stage of a reaction turbine, the pressure drop is smaller than in each stage of an impulse turbine. "
How do the specific heat ratio and specific heat at constant pressure affect the isentropic spouting velocity in turbine design?,"Therefore, the gas velocity is smaller in a reaction turbine than in an impulse turbine. Reaction turbines are aerodynamically more efficient than impulse turbines. However, reaction turbines have higher losses due to tip leakage, because of the higher difference of pressure across the rotor blades. The specific heat at constant pressure c, (J kg! K~!) and the specific heat ratio y of the working fluid of a turbine have a large influence on the isentropic spouting velocity Co (m/s) and, therefore, on the design of a turbine, as will be shown below. "
What is the formula for calculating the isentropic spouting velocity in relation to enthalpy drop and working fluid conditions in a turbine?,"The isentropic spouting velocity is defined as that velocity which is obtained during an isentropic expansion of the working fluid between the entry and the exit pressures of the stages of a turbine, as follows Cy = (2Ahr)? where Ahr (J/kg) is the enthalpy drop per unit mass of the working fluid of a turbine, that is, the available energy content per unit mass of the working fluid. The enthalpy drop per unit mass of the working fluid is the difference Ahr = ho — he where hg (J/kg) is the enthalpy per unit mass of the working fluid at the turbine inlet, and h, (J/kg) is the enthalpy per unit mass of the working fluid at the exhaust pressure, assuming an isentropic expansion, as follows  yet Ahr = ¢p(To ~ Te) = en - (2) : Po where To (K) is the total temperature of the working fluid at the turbine inlet, T, (K) is the static temperature of the working fluid at the turbine exhaust, po (N/m?) is the total pressure of the working fluid at the turbine inlet, and p, (N/m?) is the static pressure of the working fluid at the turbine exhaust.. "
How is the ratio of pressures expressed in terms of the turbine pressure ratio in turbine design?,"The ratio p,/po can be expressed as the reciprocal of the turbine pressure ratio Rr,which is a parameter frequently used in turbine design, as follows 1\> Ahr = en = (x)"
What type of turbine is typically utilized for hydrogen-fuel combinations?,"Two-stage pressure-compounded turbines are used for low-energy-fuel combina- tions (for example, liquid oxygen with RP-1, and nitrogen tetroxide with Aerozine 50), and two-row velocity-compounded turbines are used for high-energy hydrogen- fuel combinations (for example, liquid oxygen with liquid hydrogen). Low-energy- fuel turbines which are exceptions to this rule are the Redstone A-7 and the F- 1 turbines, which were two-row velocity-compounded turbines, because they had low peripheral velocities U (m/s) of their rotors. "
What advantages do two-row velocity-compounded turbines provide over single-stage turbines regarding efficiency and complexity?,Two-stage (two-row for velocity- compounded) turbines are generally chosen because they offer higher efficiency than single-stage turbines without the added complexity and mass of turbines with three or more stages (three rows for velocity-compounded). Two-row velocity- compounded turbines are either as efficient or nearly as efficient as two-stage pressure-compounded turbines when the velocity ratio U/C is less than 0.2. 
"What type of turbine is preferred for velocity ratios exceeding 0.34, and why is it considered more efficient than impulse turbines in this range?","For velocity ratios between 0.2 and 0.34, two-stage pressure-compounded impulse turbines are generally used. This is because they are more efficient up to 0.3 and, even though slightly less efficient between 0.3 and 0.34, they have less axial thrust than reaction turbines, since there is little or no pressure drop across the rotor. For velocity ratios above 0.34, reaction turbines are generally used, because they are more efficient than impulse turbines. "
What process is utilized to produce the compressed gas that drives the turbine in a rocket engine?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12], shows approximate regions of application for various types of rocket engine turbines.  | 7 0.6 a Feed s 0.5 SS “ aa _ HIP 0.3 7 yy N \ ee i 0 ee 4) —Y Y * aa  4.4 Sources of Energy for Turbines A turbine used in a rocket engine is driven by the expansion of a compressed gas, which is produced by either the decomposition of a mono-propellant or the combus- tion of a fuel with an oxidiser. "
What are the different cycles used in rocket engines for gas generation?,"The gas necessary for this purpose is generated in a rocket engine according to one of the cycles which have been described at length in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.7. For convenience of the reader, these cycles are mentioned below. They are the gas-generator cycle (used for either a mono-propellant or a couple of propellants), the tap-off cycle, the expander cycle, and the staged-combustion cycle.. "
What factors influence the design of the physical relationship between pumps and turbines in rocket engines?,"The present section is meant to show how the energy resulting from gases which expand in one or two turbines, as indicated above, is used to drive the pumps. In other words, we describe here the manners of coupling the turbines with the pumps. The drive arrangements depend on the propellants burned in the rocket and also on the general design of its engine. The term turbo-pump arrangement indicates the physical relation between the pumps and the turbines for both the fuel and the oxidiser. Examples of these arrangements are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12].. "
What type of configuration involves multiple turbines arranged sequentially for optimal flow?,"Single shefe Geared Dual_shafe, (a) Pumps back to back (>) Pancake : 4 (c) Turbines in series (4d) Turbine between pumps (0) Cf£se¢ turbine | SYMBOLS a mor Turbine Pump (€) Single geared pump (g) Turbines in parallel Gears"
What advantages does a single-stage arrangement have when the densities of propellants are similar?,"When the densities of the two propellants differ only a little (such is the case, for example, with liquid oxygen and RP-1), then the single-stage arrangement (a and d) is advantageous in terms of low complexity and mass, because it requires only one turbine. In this arrangement, the turbine may be mounted either at one end (a, as in the F-1 engine) or between the pumps (d, as in the A-7 engine).  When the turbine has very short blades, or a very large diameter, or both, then it is possible to place the two pumps on the same shaft and the turbine on a separate shaft, which is geared to the pump shaft (e). "
What type of pumps allows a turbine to function at a higher speed compared to the pumps used in the system?,This arrangement permits the turbine to operate at a higher rotational speed than that of the pumps. The MA-5 booster and sustainer engines and the YLR-91-AJ-7 engines had turbo-pumps of this type.. 
"What arrangement allows for each component of a turbo-pump to operate at its ideal rotational speed, as used in specific engine models?","The “pancake” arrangement (b) consists in gearing separately the two pumps to a single turbine. This arrangement, which permits each of the three components of a turbo-pump to operate at optimum rotational speed, was chosen for the YLR-87-AJ-7 and YLR-81-BA-11 engines."
What pump configuration can enhance efficiency by addressing limited admission areas in the oxidiser turbine of small hydrogen-fuelled upper-stage engines?,The single-geared pump arrangement (f) may be chosen to avoid a low efficiency resulting from a small area of admission in the oxidiser turbine. This may happen in small hydrogen-fuelled upper-stage engines. This arrangement was chosen for the RL-10 engine.
What advantage does a dual-shaft configuration provide for pump operation concerning propellant density variations in specific engine types?,"The dual-shaft arrangement (c and g) permits each pump to operate at its optimum speed, which leads to a high overall efficiency of the pumps. This arrangement is chosen for hydrogen-oxygen engines, because these propellants have very different values of density. In this arrangement, the turbines may operate either in series (c) or in parallel (g). When the turbines operate in series, the initial turbo-pump can rotate faster than the other, which reduces the turbine flow rate requirements. "
What benefits are gained from turbine operation in parallel for rocket engine designs?,"The J-2 and J-2S engines used this arrangement. When the turbines operate in parallel, great flexibility is obtained for off-design modes of operation, such as starting, throttling, and using variable values of mixture ratio. The parallel operation was chosen for the RS-25, which is one of the three main engines of the Space Shuttle.. "
"What is the formula for calculating the energy gained by a fluid mass when raised through a specific height, considering gravity's acceleration?","By the way, the efficiency 7 of a machine is the ratio of the useful power Pa (W) delivered by the machine to the power P, (W) supplied to it:A mass m (kg) of fluid, when raised through a height h = z, — z,, gains an energy (measured in joules) equal to mgoh, where go = 9.80665 m/s? is the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth."
What is the formula for calculating power required to achieve a specific head rise in a fluid?,"When this gain of energy occurs in a time f (s), the power P (W) needed to that effect is  For a fluid in motion, as is the case with a propellant for a rocket engine, the mass flow rate (kg/s) is . pV m= —=pq t where p (kg/m?) is the density, V (m*) is the volume, and q (m/s) is the volume flow rate of the fluid. Therefore, the power P (W) needed to obtain a head rise AH (m) in the fluid is mgo AH P= ——— = psoqAH In case of a turbine, the efficiency is Pa ir =——_ pgoqgAH Likewise, in case of a pump, the efficiency is _ P&G AH Ua P, 4.5 Description of a Typical Turbo-Pump The present section describes a typical turbo-pump used in a liquid-propellant rocket engine. "
What configuration is used for the alignment of the pumps and turbine in the Mark 3 turbo-pump?,"The turbo-pump described here is the Mark 3 pump, which was used in the Atlas, Thor, and Saturn IB boosters. The turbo-pump arrangement chosen here, marked with (e) in the preceding figure, consists in placing the two pumps on the same shaft and the turbine on a separate shaft, which is geared to the pump shaft, as will be shown below. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [19], shows the Mark 3 turbo-pump mounted on the H-1 engine of the Saturn IB booster. "

"
"What components are involved in the operation of the turbo-pump, and how is the turbine initiated?","This turbo-pump consists of an oxidiser (liquid oxygen) pump, a fuel (RP-1) pump, a reduction gearbox, an accessory drive adapter, and a gas turbine. The turbo- pump is mounted on the side of the thrust chamber, and requires only two short, high-pressure ducts connecting the volute outlets to the main propellant valves. The turbine is started by a solid-propellant cartridge, and is powered by a liquid-propellant gas generator during main operation. "
What is the flow rate of the fuel and additive mixture injected into the turbo-pump gearbox in cubic meters per second?,"The high-speed turbine drives the turbo-pump through a series of reduction gears which drive the main shaft. On the H-1 engine of the Saturn IB booster, the turbo-pump gears and bearings are cooled and lubricated by means of a fuel additive blender unit, which mixes the fuel with an oxidation and corrosion inhibitor additive (Oronite® 262, that is, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate) and injects the mixture (98% RP-1 plus 2% additive) at the flow rate 0.000347 m?/s into the turbo-pump gearbox [12]. "
What component delivers the oxidiser and fuel to both the main thrust chamber and the gas generator during operation?,"On other engines, a separate tank for lubricating oil is provided. During main operation, the turbo-pump supplies oxidiser and fuel, at the required pressures and flow rates, to the main thrust chamber and to the gas generator.. "
What are the components of a centrifugal-flow pump mounted on a common shaft?,"As shown in the preceding figure, both of the pumps are of the centrifugal-flow type. They are mounted back-to-back on the same shaft. Each of them consists of an axial-flow inducer, a centrifugal-flow impeller with backward-curved blades, a diffuser with static vanes, and a volute, according to the scheme shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3].  Diffuser ) Impeller blade The static diffuser vanes provide uniform pressure distribution, reduction of fluid velocity around the impeller, and reduction of fluid turbulence in the pump volute. "
How do the propellants change during their passage through the impeller in terms of velocity and pressure?,"Each of the propellants enters the pump in the axial direction through the inlet plane of the casing, passes from the inducer to the rotating blades of the impeller, flows outwards whilst picking up the tangential velocity of the impeller blades, flows from the impeller to the static vanes of the diffuser, and finally flows from the diffuser to the expanding volute. Each propellant gains both velocity and pressure when passing through the impeller. "
What is the purpose of the balance ribs in a pump impeller design?,"The diffuser decelerates the flow and further increases the pressure of the fluid. Balance ribs are placed on the back side of the impeller to absorb the axial thrust acting on the pump shaft. Balance ribs are blades located on the back of the impeller shroud, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3]. Balance ribs Flow > The ribs on the back-face of the impeller cause the pumped fluid to spin with the impeller. "
What effect does increasing radial distance from the impeller tips have on fluid pressure during rotational motion?,"This rotational motion decreases the pressure exerted by the fluid with the radial distance from the impeller tips [12]. Different methods for absorbing the axial thrust acting on a pump shaft have also been used, either alone or in combination, in other turbo-pumps. These methods will be described and illustrated in Sect. 4.9. . "
What organization provided the illustration of the Mark 3 turbo-pump's gearbox?,"The gearbox of the Mark 3 turbo-pump is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [19]."

What is the pitch diameter of the main shaft gear identified by letter D in the gear system?,"In the preceding figure, the letters A, B, C, and D identify the gears. In particular, A indicates the high-speed pinion gear, B and C indicate the intermediate gear, and D indicates the main shaft gear. An accessory drive pinion, integral with the intermediate gear, drives the counter-rotating accessory drive gears. The lower accessory drive gear operates the outboard engine hydraulic pump. The pitch diameters of the gears of the Mark 3 turbo-pump are d4 = 76.2 mm, dg = 161.544 mm, dc = 104.775 mm, and dp = 241.3 mm. "
What is described by the diameter of the circle formed by the midpoint of a gear's teeth?,By pitch diameter of a gear we mean the diameter of the circle described by the midpoint of the length of the teeth around the gear. The gear ratios are indicated in the preceding figure. The gear material is alloy steel AMS 6225 [20].. 
What type of bearing is used for the outboard bearing in the turbine system?,"The turbine which drives the pumps is of the impulse, two-stage, pressure- compounded type. It is bolted to the fuel pump casing, and consists of an inlet manifold, wheels and nozzles for the two stages, a turbine shaft, and a splined quill shaft which connects the turbine shaft to the high-speed (A) pinion gear. In the preceding figure, the turbine shaft inboard bearing (No. 7) is a split race ball bearing, and the outboard bearing (No. 8) is a roller bearing. . "
What is the primary function of carbon ring shaft seals in engineering applications?,"Carbon ring shaft seals prevent hot gas leakage into the bearings, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [19]."

What component prevents gas from bypassing the nozzles in the second stage of the turbine?,"The gas coming from the liquid-propellant gas generator enters the turbine inlet manifold, which directs it to the inlet nozzles of the first stage. After passing through the blades of the first stage, the gas increases its velocity by passing through the nozzles of the second stage, and is directed to the blades of the second stage. The gas leaves the turbine into the exhaust duct. The turbine stage seal prevents the gas from by-passing the nozzles of the second stage.. "
What is the input rotational speed of the turbo-pump in radians per second?,"According to [15], the input rotational speed of this turbo-pump is 3434.8 rad/s, the speed reduction ratio input/pump-shaft is 4.885 for both of the pumps, and the power transmitted is 2988 kW. The Mark 3 turbo-pump described above and the H-1 rocket engine, on which this turbo-pump is mounted, are shown in the following figure, adapted from Wikimedia [21]. "
How does the mass of a turbo-pump influence the payload capacity of a rocket stage at burnout?,"4.6 Turbo-Pump Performance The performance of a turbo-pump may be evaluated on the basis of the payload which can be carried by a rocket vehicle whose engine has a given thrust level. The performance of a turbo-pump affects the payload for the following reasons. Firstly, because the mass of a turbo-pump contributes to the mass of a rocket stage at burnout. Therefore, a high mass of a turbo-pump implies a low mass of the payload, for a given mass of a rocket stage at burnout.. "
How does high inlet flange pressure affect the mass of the pressurisation system and overall payload mass in rocket stages?,"Secondly, because the pressure required at the inlet flange of a pump determines the pressure of the pumped propellant in its tank. Therefore, when the pressure required at the inlet flange of a pump is high, the mass of the system of pressurisation in a propellant tank is also high, and consequently the payload mass is low for a given mass of a rocket stage at burnout."
How does the specific impulse of exhaust gases from a turbine affect the overall specific impulse of a rocket engine?,"Thirdly, because gases coming from the exhaust duct of a turbine are expelled at a lower specific impulse than gases coming from the thrust chamber. Such is the case,  for example, with a rocket engine using the gas-generator cycle or the tap-off cycle, which are, both of them, open cycles. When this happens, the overall specific impulse of a rocket engine decreases as a result of the lower specific impulse of the gases coming from the exhaust duct of the turbine. "
How does a reduction in specific impulse affect the payload mass relative to the total mass of a rocket stage at burnout?,"Therefore, a decrease in performance, in terms of lower specific impulse, implies a lower mass of the payload, for a given mass of a rocket stage at burnout.. "
"What measurement, expressed in seconds, accounts for the specific impulse of gas from a turbine's exhaust duct in a turbo-pump?","A quantity, called Equivalent Mass Factor of a turbo-pump (EMF 7p), measured in seconds, is used to take account of the low value of the specific impulse possessed by the gas coming from the exhaust duct of a turbine. Sobin et al. [12] define this quantity as follows"
What factors influence the determination of the partial derivative on the right side of the equation related to propulsion systems?,"where mp, (kg) is the mass of the payload, (/;)g (s) is the specific impulse of the gas exhausted by the thrust chamber of the engine, (/;)r (s) is the specific impulse of the gas exhausted by the turbine, go (m/s’) is the acceleration of gravity, and F (N) is the thrust of the engine. The value of the partial derivative on the right-hand side of the preceding equation depends on the velocity increment required by the mission, the system gross mass, the system specific impulse, and the stage propellant mass fraction Ry = m,/mpo (see Chap. "
"What is the range of equivalent mass flow factors for gas-generator cycle rocket engines, specifically between booster and upper-stage types?","1, Sect. 1.3). For a rocket engine using a gas-generator cycle, the value of EMF 7p ranges from 5 s for booster engines to 200 s for upper-stage engines [12]. For a rocket engine using a staged-combustion cycle, (J;)7 = (/s;)z, and therefore the corresponding EMF'’7p is essentially zero [12].. "
How is the mass of the turbo-pump incorporated into the overall stage payload calculation involving EMF and mass flow rate?,"The effect of a turbo-pump on a stage payload is taken into account by adding the mass mp (kg) of the turbo-pump to the product resulting from multiplying the EMF 7» (s) by the mass flow rate m7 (kg/s) of the gas coming from the exhaust duct of the turbine, as follows"
"What term describes the performance index of a turbo-pump, measured in kilograms, where a lower value indicates better efficiency?","The quantity EMr, measured in kg, is called the equivalent mass of a turbo- pump. This quantity is an index of performance of a turbo-pump, because the best turbo-pump has the lowest value of equivalent mass."
How can the mass flow rate of exhaust gas be minimized in a staged-combustion cycle?,"The value of equivalent mass can be reduced by decreasing either the mass mrp of the turbo-pump or the mass flow rate mr of the turbine exhaust gas. The mass flow rate mr of the turbine exhaust gas, in turn, can be reduced by increasing the turbo- pump efficiency, the turbine inlet temperature, and the turbine pressure ratio p./po (see Sect. 4.3). For a staged-combustion cycle, the turbine inlet temperature and the turbo-pump efficiency have a direct effect upon the engine mass and the delivered payload. "
How do turbine and pump efficiencies impact the necessary discharge pressure and overall mass of an engine system?,"High turbine and pump efficiencies reduce the required pump discharge pressure and also reduce the engine system mass. A high turbine inlet temperature, within the limits of the materials of which the turbine is made, also decreases the required pump discharge pressure and the engine mass [12]. . "
What is the calculation process to determine the equivalent mass of a turbo-pump based on given properties such as mass and mass flow rate?,"As an example of application, it is required to compute the equivalent mass of a turbo-pump for a rocket engine having the following properties: mass of the turbo- pump mrp = 861.8 kg, mass flow rate of the gas exhausted by the turbine mrp = 41.7 kg/s, and equivalent mass factor of the turbo-pump EMF rp = 55 s. After substituting these values in the preceding equation, we find"
"Calculate the value of EMr based on the equation provided, using mrp, EMF rp, and mr. What is the result?",EMr = mrp + EMF rp - mr = 861.8 + 55 x 41.7 = 3155.3 kg
What are the key parameters to consider during the design of a turbo-pump?,4.7 Turbo-Pump Design Parameters Several parameters are to be considered carefully by the designer of a turbo-pump. Some of these parameters have been identified by Huzel and Huang [22]. They are: © properties of the propellants; ¢ heads and mass flow rates of the pumps; e specific speeds of the pumps; ¢ net positive suction heads of the pumps; © efficiencies of the pumps; © overall performance and operating efficiency of the turbine; © system cycle efficiency of the turbo-pump; and e calibration and off-design characteristics of the turbo-pump.. 
What are the characteristics of propellants as described in the provided table of liquid substances?,"The first of them concerns the properties of the propellants. The following table, adapted from [22], shows physical properties of some liquid substances."
What are the substances classified as cryogenic propellants in the first ten entries?,"The first ten of these substances are storable and cryogenic propellants (in the following order, nitrogen tetroxide, hydrogen peroxide, anhydrous hydrazine, RP-1, ethanol, unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine, anhydrous hydrazine mixed in equal parts with unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine, liquid oxygen, liquid fluorine, and liquid hydrogen). The remaining two are inert substances (liquid nitrogen and water), which are cited here because they are used to calibrate pumps. "
"What are the temperature and vapour pressure variables measured for the substance described, along with their respective units?","The physical properties indicated in the table are temperature T (K), vapour pressure p, (N/m7?), density (kg/m?), and coefficient of dynamic viscosity 4 (Ns/m*). The minimum and the maximum values of density are given for RP-1, which is a mixture of hydrocarbons.  Liquid substance yt (Ns/m?). "
What challenges do cryogenic propellants present regarding construction materials and the prevention of ice formation in turbo-pump systems?,"Nabls 102.732 x 10° CaHsOH (95%) 153.064 x 107° NoH3(CH3)o/NoHy (50%) 95.0098 x 10-5 Hz0 113.074 x 107°The cryogenic propellants pose problems concerning the construction materials, seals, bearings, and lubricants used in a turbo-pump. They also pose the problem of avoiding the formation of ice."
What temperature range is observed for the turbine components in a turbo-pump operating with cryogenic propellants?,"The range of total temperatures in which the components of a turbo-pump for cryogenic propellants operate is about 16-89 K at the pumps and 920-1200 K at the turbine [22]. This fact causes gradients of temperature, which in turn pose problems of thermal expansion or contraction of the materials of which the pumps and the turbines are made."
What methods can be utilized to accommodate the thermal expansion of turbine casings?,"A structural method or a mechanical method can be adopted to ensure unrestrained thermal growth of the turbine casing, as will be shown below."
What is the relationship between temperature and diameter in a cone used for turbo-pump housing?,"The structural method uses a long cylinder for turbo-pump housing. This results in acone smaller in diameter on the chilled side and larger in diameter on the heated side. Theoretically, the temperature should be equal to ambient temperature somewhere along this cone, and therefore the diameter at that location should remain constant. At this point, the cylindrical housing is flanged and bolted onto the pump casing. "
What issue does the ambient temperature interface address in turbo-pump designs?,"The ambient temperature interface solves the problem of differential thermal growth. This method has been chosen for the Mark-29-fuel (liquid hydrogen) turbo-pump, which is illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12].

"
What mechanical issues can arise from attaching mounting brackets containing pins directly to heated components?,"A drawback of this method is the necessity of withstanding the full reactive torque of the turbine by means of the radial pins or keys. This may introduce strains and deformation in the mounting brackets in which the radial pins are anchored. Many mechanical problems have arisen when the mounting brackets containing the pins were attached directly to the hot-gas manifold or torus [12]. This method has been chosen for the J-2 axial-flow fuel turbo-pump, which is illustrated in Sect. "

How do the specific heats and molar mass of gas influence the design parameters of a turbine's blades?,"The saturation temperatures of the propellants (that is, their boiling temperatures at a given pressure) affect the choice of the materials and the requirements of thermal conditioning for a turbo-pump. In a turbine, the specific heats, the specific heat ratio, and the molar mass of the combusted gas affect the heights and the tip velocities of the blades, the type of staging, and the number of stages.. "
What key physical property significantly influences the design considerations of a turbo-pump in relation to propellants?,"The values of the vapour pressure p, (N/m7) of the propellants in ordinary oper- ating conditions are used by the designer to determine the total pressure of suction at the pump inlet, because this value contributes to form the available net positive suction head, as has been shown in Sect. 4.2.  Density is the physical property of a propellant which affects to the greatest extent the design of a turbo-pump. "
"What is the density range of the propellants mentioned, specifically for liquid fluorine and liquid hydrogen at the specified temperatures?","The densities of the propellants indicated in the preceding table range from 1509 kg/m? for liquid fluorine to 70.48 kg/m? for liquid hydrogen at the given temperatures. The effects of this wide range are shown in the following table, adapted from [12], in which the properties of the J-2 liquid oxygen (LO, density p = 1134 kg/m*) pump are compared with the properties of the J-2 liquid hydrogen (LH, density p = 70.48 kg/m?) pump.

"
What is the impeller discharge tip speed of the liquid hydrogen pump in meters per second?,"The whole head rise of the liquid hydrogen pump is 11580 m, which is almost twenty times the value (666 m) of the liquid oxygen pump, even though the pressure rises of the two pumps are of the same order of magnitude. As a result of this difference in head rise, the impeller discharge tip speed of the liquid hydrogen pump is 263.7 m/s, which is more than twice as great as the impeller discharge tip speed (118.9 m/s) of the liquid oxygen pump. "
What is the ratio of the power required by the liquid hydrogen pump to that of the liquid oxygen pump?,"If the liquid hydrogen pump were of the single-stage centrifugal type (as is the case with the liquid oxygen pump), the tip speed of the former would have to be four times the tip speed of the latter [12]. The mass (167.4 kg) of the liquid hydrogen pump is greater than the mass (138.3 kg) of the liquid oxygen pump. Finally, the liquid hydrogen pump requires a power of 5.948 x 10° W, which is more than three times the power (1.758 x 10° W) required by the liquid oxygen pump, even though the mass flow rate (208.8 kg/s) of the latter is more than five times the mass flow rate (37.92 kg/s) of the former. "
What term is used to describe fluids in which the deformation rate is directly related to the applied shear stress?,"Viscosity is a physical property which measures the degree of internal resistance opposed by a fluid to motion. The fluids for which the rate of deformation is propor- tional to the shear stress applied to them are called Newtonian fluids, after Isaac Newton. Such is the case with water, oil, and the liquid propellants cited in the table . "

How does the viscosity of a fluid affect the efficiency of a pump operating at motor speed?,"The viscosity of the pumped fluid plays an important role in the efficiency of a pump. Since a rotodynamic pump operates at motor speed, then its efficiency decreases as viscosity increases, due to the increased frictional losses within the pump."
"What types of losses impact the efficiency of a rotodynamic pump, specifically relating to friction and vortex effects?","As has been shown by several authors (see, for example, [23-25]), the losses which affect the performance of a rotodynamic pump can be classified as follows e hydraulic losses, due to friction and vortex dissipation in all components (inlet"

What formula is used to calculate the power absorbed by friction in a rotating disc within a fluid?,"e disc friction losses, due to shear stresses arising on the two (front and rear) circular surfaces of the disc-shaped impeller which rotates in the working fluid. According to Stepanoff [23], disc friction loss is by far the most important of allmechanical losses. Stepanoff also indicates the following equation to compute thepower P, (W) absorbed by disc friction 2nw*r Py = K— 5"

What are the symbols representing angular velocity and radius in the given context?,"number, and w (rad/s) and r (m) are respectively the angular velocity and the radius"
What factors should be considered when selecting materials for pumps used with reactive and thermally unstable liquid propellants?,"Some liquid propellants, for example, liquid fluorine and hydrazine, are highly reactive chemically and thermally unstable above some temperatures. Therefore, when using such propellants, special care must be taken in choosing the materials of which a pump is made. This also holds with the seals, the bearings, and the insulation materials which protect the pump from the heat coming from the turbine. "
What is the relationship between head rise and pressure rise in a pump operating a liquid propellant?," 4.8 Heads and Mass Flow Rates of Pumps The concept of head rise AH = H — H, supplied by a pump has been discussed in Sect. 4.2. The pump of a rocket engine operates to increase the pressure of a liquid propellant, from p, at the point of suction to p2 at the point of discharge, by an amount Ap (N/m?). The relation between head rise AH and pressure rise Ap is. "
What is the formula for calculating the pressure at P80 given the propellant's density and the gravitational acceleration?,"P80 where p (kg/m?) is the density of the propellant, and go (m/s?) is the gravitational acceleration of the Earth."
What factors influence the head level required by a propulsion system to achieve the specified thrust output?,"The head level H2 (m) required by arocket engine to work at the desired thrust level depends on the useful head and on the sum of the head losses affecting its hydraulic circuit. Such losses include not only those relating to the pumps (see Sect. 4.7), but also those relating to the injectors, the thrust chamber manifold, the cooling jacket, the valves, and the duct. An additional head margin is allowed for system calibration [22].. "
What does the system characteristic curve define concerning the necessary head rise for a given discharge?,"The following figure is a pump performance diagram, that is, a plot showing the performance of a pump in terms of head rise AH (m) and efficiency np as a function of discharge gq (I/s).Pump characteristic curve BEP | Pump efficiency 4 | pun curve | — & Duty point = x H, \/ System characteristic curve q (\/s) ——>The system characteristic curve defines the amount of head AH necessary to:"
"What factors contribute to the total head rise when a fluid is pumped, and how are head losses related to discharge?","e raise the pumped fluid through a certain height H, (m), called the static head; and © overcome the head losses AH; (m), which depend on the discharge gq (I/s). Therefore, the head rise results from  AH = H, + AH,"
What does the system characteristic curve represent in terms of head rise required for fluid flow through a system?,"In other words, the system characteristic curve defines the head rise AH required to push a fluid at any given volume flow rate q (1/s) through a system. This curve is a graphical presentation of the energy equation. The static head H, (m) is the vertical distance between the level of suction and the level of discharge when the pump is shut off, as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [26].. "
How does the head loss in a pipeline relate to the volume flow rate based on the model described?,"Delivery reservoir Delivery main| A, ees ; - I H, (Static head) Suction main & a= hi _) Pump and motor Suction lift SumpThe head losses AH,, which are due to friction in the pipe and in the fittings, are approximately proportional, through a coefficient a, to the square of the volume flow rate q (I/s), and therefore the system characteristic curve can be represented by a parabola, as follows"
What is the term for the specific intersection where a pump's operational capacity aligns with a system's requirements on a characteristic curve?,"The pump characteristic curve defines the head rise AH (m) which a particular pump can deliver at any given volume flow rate q (1/s). When the system curve and the characteristic curve are plotted together, a pump can only operate at the point, called the duty point, where these curves intersect. The duty point defines the volume flow rate q (I/s) and the head rise AH (m) at which a particular pump can operate in a particular system. In practice, it is desirable for a pump to operate so that its duty point should be close to a point of maximum efficiency. . "
Define the term that represents the relationship between the useful power output of a pump and the power input it receives.,"As has been shown in Sect. 4.4, the efficiency np of a pump is the ratio of the useful power delivered by the pump to the power supplied to it, as follows"

"What is the typical range of efficiency values for a pump, expressed as a decimal?",The value of the pump efficiency np at various values of volume flow rate is given by the manufacturer. This value varies with the diameter of the impeller. Values of efficiency ranging from 0.60 to 0.80 (or from 60 to 80%) are considered normal for a pump [27].
What factors influence the performance of a pump as indicated by its characteristic curve?,"The performance of a pump is measured by the variation of the volume flow rate q (l/s) with respect to the head rise AH (m), that is, by the pump characteristic curve. This performance depends on the following properties: © pump type; © pump size;"
What are the key factors depicted on a pump's performance curves provided by manufacturers?,"The performance of a pump can be shown by either a single curve for an impeller of fixed diameter, or multiple curves for impellers of various diameters in one casing. The performance curves given by most manufacturers show the total head rise AH (m) generated by the pump, the brake power BP (kW) required to drive it, the derived efficiency np = WP/BP, and the NPSHp (m), which is the net positive suction head required to drive the pump over a range of volume flow rates at a constant rotational speed of the impeller. The following figure, adapted from [28], is a typical plot of performance characteristics given by a manufacturer. . "
What is the term used to describe the point where maximum efficiency is reached for different impeller diameters in a pumping system?,"This plot shows curves for various impeller diameters. Each diameter (185 mm, 180 mm, and so on) is indicated above the corresponding curve. The plot also shows pump efficiency curves. Each efficiency value (68%, 70%, and so on) is placed near the corresponding curve. The point at which the maximum efficiency is achieved for each impeller diameter is called the Best Efficiency Point (BEP). Consequently, a pump has several BEP points, each of which is associated with an individual performance curve. "
What is a recommended strategy for a pump's impeller design to accommodate potential future increases in performance parameters?,"It is a good practice to select or design a pump whose impeller can be increased in diameter, to permit a future increase in head rise and volume flow rate [27].. "
What equations can be utilized to estimate performance changes in a pump due to alterations in rotational speed or impeller size?,"Volume flow rates, head rises, and brake powers can be calculated in a pump for variable rotational speed w (rad/s) or variable impeller diameter d (m), by using the affinity laws, as will be shown below. The affinity laws are equations which can be used to estimate changes in the performance of a pump as a result of a change in either rotational speed or impeller diameter."
"What are the two distinct sets of principles that relate flow rate, head, and power in pumps based on the conditions of impeller diameter and rotational speed?",There are two sets of affinity laws. The first set assumes a pump having an impeller of constant diameter (d = constant). The second set assumes a pump having a constant rotational speed (@ = constant).
"How does the volume flow rate, head rise, and brake power relate to the rotational speed of a pump with a constant diameter impeller?","The first set states that, for a given pump having an impeller of constant diameter, the volume flow rate is directly proportional to the rotational speed, the head rise is directly proportional to the square of the rotational speed, and the required brake power is directly proportional to the cube of the rotational speed. This statement is expressed by the following three equations  He Or Q @2 AH, — (w\* AH, \ar BP, _ (a \° BP, \ a2. "
What is the impact on efficiency when rotational speeds remain constant within a specified operational range?,"There is usually no change in efficiency (yp = constant) when the rotational speeds are within the operational range. Therefore, the affinity laws belonging to the first set can be considered to be sufficiently reliable and accurate."
What is the volume flow rate delivered by a pump operating with a head rise of 30.48 meters and a rotational speed of 371.8 rad/s?,"For example, let us consider a pump, equipped with an impeller of constant diam- eter, which delivers water at a volume flow rate g; = 6.309 I/s against a head rise AH, = 30.48 m, operating at a rotational speed w; = 371.8 rad/s and having a brake power requirement BP; = 2.634 kW."
"What is the relationship between rotational speed decrease and volume flow rate in a pump system, considering the provided values?","When the rotational speed decreases from w; = 371.8 rad/s to w2 = 334.6 rad/s, this pump delivers water at a volume flow rate@2 334.6 = — qa = =| x 6.309 = 5.678 I/s Po"" 3718 against a head rise am = (2) am = (248) 30.48 = 24.69 2 No) OT Narre) Xe = oem and requires a brake power pp, = (22) Br, = (248) 2.634 = 1.920 ew Na) Narre) SOP = ©"
How does the required brake power of a pump relate to the diameter of the impeller?,"The second set states that, for a given pump operating at a constant rotational speed, the volume flow rate is directly proportional to the impeller diameter, the head rise is directly proportional to the square of the impeller diameter, and the required brake power is directly proportional to the cube of the impeller diameter. This statement is expressed by the following three equations"
How can variations in impeller diameter impact the efficiency of a pump while keeping other components constant?,"There are usually changes in efficiency associated with changes in impeller diam- eter, because the impeller diameter is variable, but the other parts of the pump remain the same. Therefore, the results can be affected by inaccuracies."
What is the typical order of magnitude for inaccuracies affecting power requirements near the rated design point?,"Huzel and Huang point out that the order of magnitude of such inaccuracies is usually 2% or 3% within a reasonable range from the rated design point, and that they affect the power requirements rather than the relationship between head rise and volume flow rate. Therefore, the pump affinity laws hold quite well in most cases [22]."
"What are the implications on volume flow rate, head rise, and brake power if the impeller diameter changes from 0.280 m to 0.230 m?","For example, let us consider a centrifugal pump operating at a constant rotational speed w, = 183.3 rad/s, equipped with an impeller 0.280 m in diameter, and requiring a brake power BP; = 10.67 kW to deliver water at a volume flow rate q; = 18.93 I/s against a head rise AH; = 33.83 m. We want to calculate the volume flow rate, the head rise, and the required brake power, if the impeller diameter were reduced from d, = 0.280 m to d2 = 0.230 m.. "
What brake power in kilowatts is required when a pump delivers water at a volume flow rate of 15.55 m³/h against a head rise of 22.83 meters?,"When the impeller is trimmed as indicated above, this pump delivers water at a volume flow rate9 = 9 19.93 = 15.55 1 n= a = 0.08 x 16.95 = Id.

What parameter is utilized to categorize the performance of inducers and impellers based on their geometric proportions?,"The performance of a pump is also expressed by its specific speed N, which has been defined in Sect. 4.2. This parameter is used to classify inducers and impellers according to their performance and their geometric proportions, independently of their size or of the speed at which they operate, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [29].  0 Hy , f Centrifugal Mixed-flow Inducer (axial) a k Boece r | ° 10-7 10° Specific speed at BEP. "
How is specific speed related to pump head rise and volume flow rate for a given rotational speed?,"As has been shown in Sect. 4.2, the specific speed of a pump is computed with reference to the best efficiency point (BEP) of that pump. For a given rotational speed, a low value of specific speed correspond to a high head rise AH and to a low volume flow rate q. The reverse is true for a high value of specific speed. For an impeller of the centrifugal-flow type (the first and the second from left), the head rise is due principally to centrifugal forces. "
What specific speed range is associated with an impeller type that requires a head rise exceeding 61 meters?,"This type of impeller is used for a head rise greater than 61 m. The corresponding specific speed ranges from 0.18 to 0.44. The ratio r2/r, of the impeller radius at outlet to the impeller radius at inlet ranges from 2 to 3. For an impeller of the Francis type (the third and the fourth from left), the specific speed ranges from 0.44 to 0.88, and the ratio r2/r; ranges from 1.3 to 1.8. For an impeller of the mixed-flow type (the fifth from left), the head rise is due partly to centrifugal forces and partly to axial forces. "
What are the specific speed ranges for axial-flow impellers and inducers?,"The specific speed ranges from 0.80 to 1.3. For an impeller of the axial-flow type (the sixth from left), the head rise is due only to axial forces. The specific speed ranges from 1.1 to 2.2 for multi-stage impellers, and from 2.2 to 4.4 for inducers [22].. "

The enthalpy drop per unit mass of the working fluid is the difference Ahr = ho — he  where hg (J/kg) is the enthalpy per unit mass of the working fluid at the turbine inlet, and he (J/kg) is the enthalpy per unit mass of the working fluid at the exhaust pressure, assuming an isentropic expansion, as follows yol De\ Ahr = ¢(To — Te) = epTo| 1 — (“) Po where To (K) is the total temperature of the working fluid at the turbine inlet, T, (K) is the static temperature of the working fluid at the turbine exhaust, po (N/m’) is the total pressure of the working fluid at the turbine inlet, p, (N/m’) is the static pressure of the working fluid at the turbine exhaust, and c, (J kg~!

"What is the maximum temperature limit, in Kelvin, commonly utilized in turbine design?","In practice, a limit of 1200 K is used in the design of a turbine [22]. The efficiency of a turbine is limited by the following losses:. "
What factors contribute to the reduction of velocity in gases exiting turbine nozzles?,"(1) Nozzle losses, which are due to phenomena of flow turbulence, friction in the fluid, and loss of heat, which occur when the combusted gas passes through the nozzles of a turbine. These losses decrease the velocity at which the combusted gas leaves the nozzles."
"What factors contribute to blade losses in a rotor system, particularly related to gas flow and design aspects?","(2) Blade losses, which are due to the residual velocity of the gas as it leaves the rotor blades, to the angle between the direction of the gas flow through the nozzles and the direction of motion of the rotor blades, to turbulence in the flow, and to friction in the fluid. As has been shown in Sect. 4.3, the losses due to the residual velocity of the gas can be reduced by selecting carefully the value of the blade-to-gas velocity ratio U/Cp, where U (m/s) is the peripheral velocity of the rotor blades, and Co (m/s) is the isentropic spouting velocity, which in turn depends on the enthalpy drop per unit mass of the gas Ahr (J/kg) as follows: Co = (2Ahr)”. The losses due to turbulence in the flow can be reduced by designing carefully the blades and the nozzles.. "
What factors contribute to energy losses in a turbine due to gas leakage between rotor blades and casing?,"(3) Leakage losses, which are due to the clearances between the tips of the rotor blades and the turbine casing. These clearances permit part of the gas to leak past the blades without impinging on them, which fact causes an energy loss. Losses of the same type are due to gas leakage from one stage to the next in a multi-stage pressure-compounded turbine, because of the clearances existing between the shaft and the sealing diaphragm. . "
What factors contribute to the losses encountered due to friction between a rotor disc and gas in a rotating system?,"(4) Disk friction losses, which due to the friction between the rotor disc surface and the gas which is in contact with this surface. They are also due to the centrifugal action impressed by the rotor disc on the gas. As a result of this action, part of the gas flows radially toward the casing, and is dragged along the internal surface of the casing by the rotor blades."
What type of losses are caused by friction occurring in bearings and seals within a mechanical system?,"(5) Mechanical losses, which are due to the friction in the bearings and in the seals."

What type of turbine is often utilized when the blade-to-gas velocity ratio is low in liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"For liquid-propellant rocket engines, the most frequently used turbo-pumps are those of the impulse type, whose working principle has been described in Sect. 4.3. In case of low values (0.2 or less) of the blade-to-gas velocity ratio U/Co, single- shaft, two-stage, velocity-compounded turbines are often used. Turbo-pumps like these have the advantages of simplicity and low mass. By contrast, the presence of a gearbox between the pumps and the turbine makes it possible to reach a higher value of the blade-to-gas velocity ratio U/C than would be possible with a direct drive and also to use a pressure-compounded turbine in place of a velocity-compounded turbine. Turbo-pumps like these have the advantage of a higher efficiency over those mentioned above.. "
How can the power output of a turbine be adjusted based on inlet gas pressure and mass flow rate?,The power level of a turbine can be regulated by controlling the total pressure po (N/m?) of the gas at the turbine inlet and its mass flow rate mr (kg/s) through the turbine [22].

"
What are the two main types of cycles an engine can use when fed by turbo-pumps?,"An engine fed by turbo-pumps may use either a cycle of the open type (which includes the gas-generator cycle and the tap-off cycle) or a cycle of the closed type (which includes the expander cycle and the staged- combustion cycle). In a cycle of the open type, the gas exhausted by the turbine is either discharged separately from the gas exhausted by the thrust chamber or ducted into the low-pressure portion of the thrust chamber. In a cycle of the closed type, the gas exhausted by the turbine is ducted into the high-pressure portion of the thrust chamber. . "
"What main advantage do open type cycles offer due to their design, despite their lower efficiency compared to closed type cycles?","The cycles of the open type have a lower discharge pressure of the propellant pumps and a higher pressure ratio of the turbine. Therefore, they have the advantages of simplicity and low mass, but also the disadvantage of an inefficient use of the gas exhausted by the turbine for the purpose of generating thrust. In other words, a cycle of the open type is less efficient than a cycle of the closed type. The system cycle efficiency 1-, of a cycle of the open type (subscript 0) can be expressed as follows. "

How can the efficiency of an open type cycle system be improved in an upper stage engine?,"The system cycle efficiency of a cycle of the open type can be increased by attaching a nozzle of high expansion ratio to the turbine exhaust duct, in case of an engine for an upper stage, or by post-combusting the gas exhausted by the turbine with additional propellant into an after-burner, as is the case with the engine of a supersonic jet aircraft. The system cycle efficiency of a cycle of the open type ranges from 0.96 to 0.99 [22].. "
What is the pressure condition required at the turbine exhaust in a closed-type cycle compared to the combustion chamber?,"In acycle of the closed type, the gas exhausted by the turbine is firstly ducted into the main combustion chamber in order to be burned again with one of the propellants, and then ejected through the nozzle attached to the main combustion chamber. A cycle of the closed type requires a pressure of the gas at the turbine exhaust higher than the pressure of the gas in the combustion chamber.

What key factors influence the performance of a rocket engine and can affect its ability to fulfill its mission?,"The performance of an individual rocket engine depends on its thrust, specific impulse, mass flow rate, and oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio. Each engine is designed to operate at a performance level defined by the values of the quantities indicated above. Another engine, even of the same type, may operate at performance parameters which are slightly different from the design values. When the deviations of the actual from the nominal performance values are greater than a few percent, then a rocket vehicle may be incapable of accomplishing its mission.. "
"What factors can affect the efficiency of the combustion process in propellant injectors, according to Sutton and Biblarz?","These deviations are due to several reasons. Sutton and Biblarz [30] have identified some of them, which are specified below. Firstly, the unavoidable tolerances on the construction materials may alter the impingement of the propellants in the injector, and this change may affect the efficiency of the combustion process. Secondly, a change in mixture ratio, even small, may cause an increase in unused propellant at the end of the burn. "
What factors can lead to deviations in propellant performance parameters from their intended design values?,"The quantity of residual propellant ranges usually from 0.5 to 2% of the total quantity [31]. Thirdly, variations in either the composition or the storage temperature of the propellants may induce changes in their density and viscosity. Fourthly, regulator setting tolerances or changes in flight acceleration can also cause deviations of the performance parameters from the design values.. "
What is the primary purpose of adjusting parameters in an engine calibration process?,"The engine calibration system is a process which corrects an engine system, by adjusting the values of its parameters, in order to obtain the desired performance within the allowed limits of tolerance.The engine components which need calibration are e hydraulic and pneumatic components, such as pumps, pipes, valves, expansion"
What are the essential components required for handling high-temperature and cryogenic propellant applications in rocket propulsion systems?,"e high-temperature components, such as thrust chamber, turbines, gas generators or pre-burners, etc.; and © components for cryogenic propellants, such as pumps, valves etc."
How are components evaluated for their pressure drops in a controlled test environment?,"Hydraulic and pneumatic components are tested by means of water flowing through them in flow benches. This makes it possible to determine their pressure drops at rated conditions. Components operating at high temperatures are tested through hot firing. Likewise, components operating at low temperature are tested by using cryogenic propellants or liquid nitrogen."
How are engine properties evaluated in relation to pressure drops across its components and the targeted mass flow rates?,"The engine properties are estimated by summing the corrected values of the pres- sure drops due to its individual components at the desired mass flow rates. In addition, the actual measured mixture ratio si, /imy must be equal to the desired mixture ratio"
"What are the two methods for managing engine performance parameters, and how do they differ in their approach to control?","Two methods can be employed to control the performance parameter of an engine. The first of them uses an automatic system with feedback and a digital computer which controls the deviations of the parameters in real time. The other method uses an initial static calibration of the engine system. In particular, the pressures supplied to the propellants by means of the respective pumps (or by means of gases under pressure, in case of gas-pressurised propellants) must be balanced against the pressure drops and the pressure in the combustion chamber. "
What is required for an engine to function properly regarding mass flow rates and the ratio of oxidiser to fuel?,"This balancing is necessary in order for an engine to operate at the desired values of the mass flow rates and of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio o/f.  The following figure shows a diagram of pressure balancing, expressed in terms of head rise AH (m) against volume flow rate g (m/s), for one of the two propellant lines of a bi-propellant rocket engine fed by a turbo-pump system. 110% rated speed .

What factors must be changed during testing to derive calibration curves for a pump?,"The rotation speed of a pump is a variable quantity. The pump calibration curves can only be drawn after obtaining data resulting from tests. Such tests are executed by varying the impeller diameter (impeller trimming) and the hydraulic resistances at the discharge, in order to obtain the properties required by engine system."
What is necessary to ensure that the energy supplied at the turbine shaft matches the total power required for pumps and associated losses?,"The volume flow rate of the propellants to either a gas generator or a pre-burner also needs calibration. The power balance requires the power delivered at the turbine shaft to be equal to the sum of the power needed to drive the pumps and the power losses in the bearings, seals, etc."
"What factors are combined with assumed quantities to predict pump head rise, pump flow rate, and turbine flow rate in a turbo-pump design?","Ina system balance of a turbo-pump at the initial point of design, known quantities (such as engine type, pressure in the thrust chamber, expansion area ratio in the nozzle, oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio, and thrust) are combined with assumed quantities (such as pump efficiencies, turbine efficiencies, turbine pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, and various indicators of engine performance), in order to predict the requirements relating to the pump head rise, the pump flow rate, and the turbine flow rate. "
How is the power supplied to the turbine shaft related to the various sources of power consumption?,"In making this balance, the power delivered to the turbine shaft is equated to all the sources of power absorption, as has been shown above.. "
Why is it important to maintain system balance in a turbo-pump during the final design stage of a rocket engine?,"A system balance of a turbo-pump is also necessary at the final point of design. This is because refinements and changes, which may be made in the detailed design of a rocket engine, can affect the turbo-pump operation. For example, during the development of the engine of the MA-5 sustainer, the efficiencies of the pumps and of the turbine were found, when tested, below the initial values assumed for them in the design balance of the engine system. "
What adjustments were necessary to enhance the turbine drive pressure from the gas generator to achieve the specified thrust output?,"This fact required changes to increase the  value of the turbine drive pressure available from the gas generator, in order for the engine to meet its rated thrust values.. "
What potential issues can arise from a turbo-pump operating outside its intended conditions?,"An off-design operating condition of a turbo-pump may be more demanding for a particular component than the nominal design condition. Consequently, the whole operating range of a rocket engine is to be considered carefully. Otherwise, a pump which operates satisfactorily in design conditions may perform unsatisfactorily or even fail in off-design conditions."
What factors must be considered to accurately define the full operational range of a turbo-pump beyond its planned specifications?,"In order to define the actual operating range of a turbo-pump, it is necessary to determine the planned operating range. Then, a system balance including the predicted operating characteristics of the turbo-pump is used to determine the whole range of operation over the planned engine throttling and the variation of the oxidiser- to-fuel mixture ratio. For this purpose, it is necessary to take account not only of the ordinary variations in the operating conditions, but also of the variations due to manufacturing tolerances. "
What type of data is essential for estimating tolerances on hydraulic resistance and flow characteristics in liquid-propellant engine components?,"This requires the availability of data on known tolerances of components from existing liquid-propellant engines. These data are used to esti- mate tolerances on hydraulic resistance of lines, valves, and passage channels of the coolant in the nozzle, tolerances on the head rise/flow rate and efficiency/flow rate curves of the pump, etc.. "
What statistical method is used to assess the overall impact of component tolerances in the system?,"The tolerances on all the components are assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. The effects of these tolerances are treated statistically, by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the effects of all the components. The effect of each component is determined either by performing an engine balance assuming that the given component is at one of the extreme points of its range of tolerance, or by linearising the equations which govern the engine system in order to determine the influence coefficients for each of the components considered.. "
What methods are employed to regulate the gas flow rate to the turbine and oxidiser flow rate to the gas generator in rocket engines?,"The control points used for regulating the thrust and the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio can affect the discharge pressure of the turbo-pump and therefore its system design. Either calibration orifices or a pressure regulator have been used to control either the gas flow rate from the gas generator to the turbine or the oxidiser flow rate to the gas generator. For the J-2, F-1, and H-1 rocket engines, calibration orifices have been used in the turbine-gas generator lines to set the power level. "
What method is employed by the RL10 engine to manage turbine power using heated hydrogen?,"For the RL10 engine, heated fuel (hydrogen) has been used to control the turbine power. For this purpose, the fuel was heated by passing through the cooling jacket of the thrust chamber before being ducted to the turbine through a control system which sensed the thrust chamber pressure and adjusted a turbine bypass valve. By contrast, the MA-5 and MB-S rocket engines used a pressure regulator to control the flow of the oxidiser to the gas generator.. "
How do the MA-5 sustainer and J-2 engine differ in regulating the proportion of oxidiser to fuel?,"The control of the oxidiser-to-fuel mixture ratio has been obtained by using either the main propellant valves or a valve controlling the bypass of a propellant around its pump.

What are the key advantages of using cast aluminium alloys over titanium alloys for low-stress applications?,"[4]. A cast aluminium alloy is the proper choice for an inducer subject to low stress when low cost is important. This is because aluminium is easy to forge and machine, but not apt to be welded or brazed. Titanium alloy parts are more expensive to machine than comparable parts of aluminium alloys, but less expensive than alloys such as Inconel® 718 or René® 41. Titanium alloys can be welded by gas-tungsten are or electron-beam processes. Proper welding procedures are to be observed for titanium alloys [4].. "
What effect does pre-whirl of the inlet flow have on a pump's suction performance?,"An increase in the suction performance of a pump may be obtained by pre-whirl of the inlet flow. For this purpose, the inlet flow is mixed with high-velocity fluid taken from the pump discharge. This flow is injected through a ring of orifices in an axial direction upstream of the inducer. Pre-whirl introduced in this manner has improved flow distribution and reduced flow instabilities which may occur when a pump is throttled [4].. "
What component can be added to minimize reverse fluid movement in an inducer operating below optimal flow conditions?,"Backflow occurs in an inducer at low flow (about 90% or less of the design value) as a result of local head breakdown in the tip region of the vanes. In order to reduce backflow or control its effects, a backflow deflector can be incorporated in the inlet line, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [4].  || E Backflow"
What effects does a deflector have on head and critical NPSH below nominal flow in fluid systems?,"Below nominal flow, (between 20 and 90% of the design flow) where back- flow becomes important, the deflector results in increased head, reduced critical NPSH, and lower amplitudes of low-frequency oscillations. Above nominal flow, the deflector has a detrimental effect [4]. Further information on backflow control can be found in [35]."

"What components are included in the design of a pump's housing, as described by Furst and Keller?","The following part of the present section deals with the design of the housing, which is the envelope containing the pump. According to Furst and Keller [3], the housing consists of:"
"Identify the components involved in the construction of single-stage and multi-stage pumps, including the main enclosure and the systems affecting fluid flow.","e the casing, which is the part of the pump containing the impeller; e the diffusing system and the volute for single-stage pumps; and e the crossover system for multi-stage pumps."
"What is an example of a multi-stage pump specifically designed for liquid hydrogen, featuring back-to-back impellers and an external passage?","An example of a multi-stage centrifugal-flow pump is the Centaur (RL-10) liquid- hydrogen pump, which has two stages mounted with the impellers back-to-back with volute housing and an external diffusing passage between the two stages, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [3].

What types of diffusers can be incorporated within a diffusing system to manage flow before and after the volute?,"The diffusing system may include vaned or vaneless diffusers upstream of the volute and one or more conical diffusers downstream of the volute. The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [3], shows three types of diffusing systems.WHA WI _ G@®_. (a) Votute (b) Vaneless diffuser (ce) Vaned diffuser plus plus volute folded volute"
What components are included in the housing that provide support for the rotating element and ensure fluid does not escape?,"The housing also contains the bearings, which support the rotating element, and the seals, which prevent leakage of the pumped fluid."
What components of a pump facilitate the transformation of kinetic energy into pressure energy?,"The diffusing system and the volute form the part of the pump in which the kinetic energy impressed to the fluid by the rotating element is converted into pressure energy. The head loss due to friction at the inlet of a pump is very small, due to the short path and to the low velocity of the flow. The conical or cylindrical shape of the suction duct depends on whether the tip contour is or is not tapered. "
What is the minimum clearance-to-blade length ratio achieved for fuel pumps in relation to inducer design?,The best results have been obtained by tapering the contour of both the tip and the hub [22]. This is because the gradual reduction of the suction area upstream of the impeller eye makes the flow steady.  The rotating parts of oxidiser pumps must not be allowed to rub metal to metal. This rubbing may cause dangerous explosions in liquid-oxygen pumps. Practically attained minimum values of the inducer clearance-to-blade length ratio are 5% for fuel and 20% for oxidiser pumps. 
What is the material used for the inducer casing lining when closer clearances are needed for oxidiser pumps?,"When closer clearances are required for oxidiser pumps, a liner made of PCTFE (Poly-Chloro-Tri-Fluoro-Ethylene, whose trade name is Kel-F® or Neoflon®) should be used for the inducer casing. The chemical formula of this polymer is (CF,CCIF),, where n is the number of monomer units in its molecule. A layer of this material, 2.54 mm in thickness, is inserted between the tips of the inducer blades and the wall of the suction duct, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [4].

What is the primary mechanism for converting velocity head to pressure head in a system without static vanes?,"As has been shown here and also in Sect. 4.5, the diffusing system may, or may not, have static vanes. In case of a vaneless diffuser, the pumped fluid at the outlet of the impeller is discharged into a single volute channel, whose cross section increases gradually, and the conversion from velocity head to pressure head takes place principally in the conical nozzle at the outlet of the pump."
What are the efficiency differences between a vaned diffuser and a vaneless diffuser in fluid dynamics?,"In case of a vaned diffuser, the pumped fluid at the outlet of the impeller is discharged into a diffuser provided with vanes, and the same conversion takes place prevalently in the channels between the diffusing vanes, before the fluid has reached the volute channel. A vaneless diffuser has the advantage of simplicity, but a vaned diffuser is more efficient than the other."
What are the primary design specifications for a centrifugal-flow pump featuring a vaneless diffuser and a single outlet?,"The principal design parameters of a vaneless-diffuser, single outlet, centrifugal- flow pump are shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [22].  Les) =: DIAMETER d, Fey ae by 9s"
What angle must the flow direction at the impeller exit align with to prevent downstream turbulence and wear?,"These parameters are the area A, (m7) of the volute at the throat, the flow area Ag (m7), the angle 0, (rad) between the side walls of the volute, the volute tongue angle a, (rad), the radius 7, (m) at which the volute tongue starts, and the width b3 (m) of the volute. By volute tongue angle aw, we mean the camber angle formed by the tongue with the circumferential direction [25]. The direction of the flow at the exit of the impeller must match the angle @,,, in order to avoid turbulence and wear downstream of the tongue. "
What is the relationship between the volute tongue angle and the angle of the absolute velocity vector at the impeller outlet?,"For this purpose, the value of the volute tongue angle a, is chosen close to the value of the angle a’ between the absolute velocity vector c’> and the peripheral velocity vector u2 at the outlet of the impeller, that is, a, ~ a’. The values of the other parameters are discussed below, in accordance with the indications given in [22].. "
What methods are utilized to find the area of the volute's cross-section at a specific angular distance from the tongue?,The methods used to determine the cross-sectional area Ag of the volute at an angular distance 6 (rad) from the volute tongue are: (a) constant moment of momentum per unit mass; and (b) constant mean velocity.
"How is the circumferential component of absolute velocity in a volute related to the radius, assuming no friction losses?","In the method (a), the circumferential component c’,3 of the absolute velocity of the pumped fluid in the volute is assumed to be inversely proportional to the radius r (c'.3 r = constant), which would be true only in the absence of friction losses. After the shape of the volute has been determined, the volute cross-sectional area satisfying the given flow requirement is determined at each circumferential station. "
"What design approach was utilized for developing the pump housing in both Titan I and II, as well as the J-2S Mark 29 fuel pump?","This method was used for the design of the pump housing of Titan I and Titan II. It was also used, corrected for friction losses, for the design of the J-2S Mark 29 fuel pump (illustrated in Sect. 4.7), which experienced very light radial bearing loads [3].. "
What is the relationship between the area of the volute at an angular distance and the volume flow rate of the pump?,"In the method (b), the mean absolute velocity c’3 (m/s) of the pumped fluid in the volute is assumed to be constant at all cross sections of the volute over the circum- ference, and therefore the area Ay of each cross section is increased proportionally to the increase in the central angle 6 of the volute. In other terms, the constant mean absolute velocity c’3 is made equal to  gat bs “A, 2m Ao where q (m?/s) is the volume flow rate of the pump, A, (m7) is the area of the volute at the throat (where 6 = 0), and Ay (m7) is the area of the volute at an angular distance 6 (rad) from the volute tongue. This method was conceived to simplify the volute design.. "
What factors contribute to the differences in hydraulic forces experienced by the impeller in various pump design methods?,There are only small differences in pump efficiency between the two methods. The unsymmetrical pressure (with its associated radial hydraulic forces upon the impeller) around the volute passage has been found to be higher in pumps designed according to the constant-mean-velocity method [3].The design value of the mean absolute velocity c’3 (m/s) can be determined from the following correlation
What is the variable representing the design head rise of a pump in relation to the design factor and the acceleration of gravity?,"cy = KyQgoAH)? where K,, is a design factor, whose value (determined experimentally and ranging from 0.15 to 0.55) is lower for pumps of higher specific speed, AH (m) is the design head rise of the pump, and go = 9.80665 m/s? is the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth."
"What is the acceptable range for the radius where the volute tongue begins, in relation to the outer radius of the impeller, to prevent turbulence?","The radius r, at which the volute tongue starts should be from 1.05 to 1.1 times the outer radius rz of the impeller, in order to avoid turbulence."
What is the width ratio of the volute at the bottom of its trapezoidal cross section to the impeller width for low specific speed pumps?,"The width b3 of the volute at the bottom of its trapezoidal cross section is chosen to be 2.0 times b2 (where bp is the impeller width at the outlet) in case of pumps of low specific speeds, and from 1.6 to 1.75 times b2 in case of pumps of high specific speeds."
What recommendation is given for the angle between the side walls of the volute for pumps with high specific speeds?,"The maximum value of the angle 6, between the side walls of the volute should be about z/3 radians. A value smaller than this should be chosen for pumps of high specific speeds or high flow angles a’ at the impeller outlet."
What design feature is implemented in centrifugal-flow pumps to minimize the radial force on the impeller shaft due to pressure variations?,"The pressure exerted by the pumped fluid on the walls of the volute cannot be kept uniform under all operating conditions. Consequently, the impeller shaft is subject to a radial force. In order to eliminate or reduce this force, double-volute housings are used. A typical double-volute, single-outlet housing of a centrifugal-flow pump is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [22].  DIRECTION OF FLOW | : 7 ROTATION. "
What effect does the second tongue in a double-volute housing have on the total resultant radial force in flow?,"In the double-volute housing illustrated above, the flow forms two streams as a result of a second tongue placed at an angular distance of z radians from the first. This symmetry in the flow may reduce the total resultant radial force."
What is the advantage of using a diffuser with static vanes compared to a vaneless diffuser in terms of fluid flow and pressure conversion?,"A diffuser provided with static vanes has been illustrated in Sect. 4.5. The shape of the volute of a vaned diffuser is the same as that of a vaneless diffuser, but a vaned diffuser has a plurality of passages through which the pumped fluid flows from the impeller to the discharge nozzle. This fact makes it possible to convert the velocity head possessed by the fluid into pressure head in a narrower space than is the case with a vaneless diffuser. "
What is the recommended ratio of the vaned diffuser width at the inlet compared to the impeller width at the outlet?,"High performance is obtained by a small radial distance (from 0.8 to 3.0 mm, depending on the impeller diameter) between the impeller and the inlet tips of the static vanes. The width of a vaned diffuser at the inlet may be chosen to be from 1.6 to 2.0 times b) (where b is the impeller width at the outlet). With reference to the following figure, re-drawn from [22], the vane angle a3 at the inlet should be chosen equal or close to the angle a’, between the vectors c’2 and uz at the outlet of the impeller.  DIFFUSER VANES DIFFUSER THROAT — VOLUTE —ee PASSAGE | mS | | Y Mix a, es ee. "
How can the mean value of absolute flow velocity be determined using the diameters of the impeller and diffuser?,"The mean value of the absolute velocity c’3 (m/s) of the flow at the throats of thediffuser can be determined approximately as follows dp = ao where d» (m) is the diameter of the impeller at the outlet, d3 (m) is the pitch diameter of the diffuser at the throats, and c’ (m/s) is the absolute velocity of the flow at the outlet of the impeller."
What is the relationship between the number of vanes in a diffuser and the volume flow rate carried by each passage between contiguous vanes?,"Let Z3 be the number of vanes in the diffuser. Since each passage between two contiguous vanes can be assumed to carry an equal fraction of the total volume flow rate q (m/s), then the following equation holds"
What is the formula that relates the width and height at the throat of a passage in a diffuser to the variable Z2 at the impeller outlet?,q b3h3Z3 = — 3 where b3 (m) and h3 (m) are respectively the width and the height at the throat of each passage in the diffuser.After the number Z2 of backward-curved rotating vanes at the impeller outlet has

What is the relationship between height and width at the throat of each passage in the described system?,The height /3 (m) and the width b3 (m) at the throat of each passage between twocontiguous vanes in a diffuser are chosen so that 3 = b3. The angle of divergence of  each passage downstream of the throat is chosen in the range from 7/18 to 27/15 rad. The velocity of the flow downstream of the diffuser is kept a little higher than its velocity in the discharge line of the pump [22].

"

Since a’y has been found above to be equal to 0.2041 rad, then we take a, = 0.2041 rad 7/15 rad."
What is the expression used to calculate the radius where the volute tongue begins in relation to the outer radius of the impeller?,"The radius r, at which the volute tongue starts is taken slightly greater than the outer radius rz of the impeller, in order to avoid turbulence. For this purpose, we  choose r; = 1.05 r2. Since the outer diameter of the impeller has been found to be dz = 0.3765 m, then the value of r; can be determined as follows 0.3765 r, = 1.05 x a = 0.1977 m The cross section of the volute is assumed to be of trapezoidal shape.

What is the effect of the impeller's rotational motion on the pressure exerted by the fluid as the radial distance increases?,"The radial ribs reduce the static pressure in the space between the back shroud of the impeller and the wall of the casing, because the pumped fluid spins in this space with the impeller. This rotational motion decreases the pressure exerted by the fluid with the radial distance from the impeller tips [12]. Holes may be provided through the impeller into the inside diameter region of the radial ribs to vent that region statically and to provide a positive coolant flow into the radial ribs to prevent cavitation caused by fluid heating which results from the pumping work of the radial ribs [3]. .

What design feature in the F-1 engine's oxidiser pump impeller helps manage axial force alongside radial ribs?,"The gear-driven pumps of the Titan launch vehicles had open-face impellers with radial ribs in the impeller hub, in order to reduce the axial force to a value which could be sustained by a split-inner-race ball bearing. The turbo-pump of the F-1 engine had shrouded impellers. In order to control the axial force, the impeller of the oxidiser pump of the F-1 engine had an inlet wear ring and radial ribs, whereas the impeller of the fuel pump of the same engine had inlet and hub wear rings.

How is the axial force reduction at the back shroud of an impeller influenced by the dimensions of radial ribs in a centrifugal-flow pump?,"As an example of application, it is required to compute the reduction Fz (N) of the axial forces acting of the back shroud of the impeller of a given centrifugal- flow pump, due to the installation of radial ribs having the following dimensions: outside diameter of the radial ribs d, = 0.3759 m, inside diameter of the radial ribs d, = 0.1219 m, height of the radial ribs t = 0.005334 m, and average distance s = 0.006350 m between the impeller back shroud and the wall of the casing.

What technique is employed in the Mark 48-O turbo-pump to manage axial thrust between its pump and turbine?,"Still another method to control axial thrust in a centrifugal-flow pump uses a self-compensating balance piston. This method was used in the Mark 48-O (liquid oxygen) turbo-pump, which was designed to achieve a balance of axial thrust between the pump and the turbine. For this purpose, the back side of the pump impeller contains a balance piston, which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [37]. "
What is the flow path of liquid oxygen from the impeller discharge to the eye of the impeller in a balancing system?,"The rotating member of the balance piston is the rear shroud of the impeller. To operate the piston, high-pressure liquid oxygen from the impeller discharge passes through a high-pressure orifice located at the outer diameter of the impeller into the balance piston cavity. From this cavity, the liquid oxygen passes through a low-pressure orifice near the impeller hub into the balance piston sump. From there, the liquid oxygen returns to the eye of the impeller through axial passages in the diffuser vanes and radial holes in the diffuser and inlet [38]. "

What effect does an unbalanced load toward the pump inlet have on the gaps of high-pressure and low-pressure openings?,"The thrust-compensating effect is obtained because the openings of the high- pressure orifice and of the low-pressure orifice vary with the axial position of the rotor. Therefore, the axial force due to the pressure on the rear shroud of the impeller varies correspondingly. For example, an unbalanced load toward the pump inlet causes a reduction in the high-pressure orifice gap and an increase in the low-pressure orifice gap. This, in turn, causes a reduction in the pressure force of the impeller rear shroud, introducing a compensating load change [38].. "
"What factors are considered when selecting materials for thrust balance systems, specifically regarding safety and compatibility with propellant?","Materials used for thrust balance systems are chosen taking account of their compatibility with the propellant, strength at the required rotating speed, and safety in the event of an inadvertent rub.

For this purpose, such pumps have been used in the multi-stage configuration only. The head rise AH made available by a typical single-stage centrifugal-flow pump, when the pumped fluid is liquid hydrogen, is about 19,800 m, which corresponds to a pressure rise Ap of about 70.85 x 9.807 x 19,800 = 1.376 x 107 N/m?. "
What is the typical head rise range provided by each stage of a multi-stage axial-flow pump?,"This is due to the very low density p = 70.85 kg/m? of liquid hydrogen. When higher values then these are required for AH and Ap, then a multi-stage axial-flow pump is chosen. A pump of the latter type makes it possible to obtain a head rise ranging from about 1520 to 2740 m for each stage [22].. "
What is the minimum allowable volume flow rate for axial-flow pumps designed for liquid hydrogen in m³/s?,"The volume flow rate q of axial-flow pumps used for liquid hydrogen cannot be lower than about 0.347 m?/s, because the height of the rotor or stator vanes of such pumps cannot be lower than about 12.7 mm, for manufacturing reasons. For values greater than 0.347 m/s of volume flow rate and in the range from 9140 to 19,800 m of head rise, the design requirements of a liquid-hydrogen pump can be satisfied by either a single-stage centrifugal flow pump or a multi-stage axial flow pump.

This assumption requires a constant area of the cross section of the pump, in order for the equation of continuity of flow to be satisfied. By so doing, the effects of frictional drag at the walls of the housing and at the vanes are neglected.. "
What are the three specific diameters related to the vanes in an axial-flow pump's cylindrical section?,"The rotor of an axial-flow pump imparts kinetic energy to the pumped fluid by increasing the axial component c,, of the absolute velocity vector c of the flow.

What effect does a reduction of pressure in the control chamber have on the motion of the rotor assembly in a pump?,"When an axial thrust moves the rotor assembly toward the inducer of the pump, then the balance piston closes the high-pressure orifice at the front seal rub and opens the low-pressure orifice at the rear seal rub, thereby reducing the pressure in the control chamber placed between the two seal rubs. This reduction of pressure counteracts the hydraulic axial thrust acting on the rotor assembly toward the inducer, and restrains the motion of the rotor assembly in that direction. "
What mechanism counteracts the reverse axial force on the rotor assembly when it shifts towards the pump discharge?,"Likewise, when a reverse axial thrust moves the rotor assembly towards the discharge of the pump, then the balance piston opens the high-pressure orifice at the front seal rub and closes the low-pressure orifice at the rear seal rub, thereby increasing the pressure in the control chamber placed between the two seal rubs. This increase in pressure counteracts the reverse axial thrust acting on the rotor assembly toward the discharge, and causes the rotor assembly to return to its neutral position. "

What is the formula for calculating the isentropic velocity ratio for a single-stage turbine?,"As has been shown in Sect. 4.3, the design isentropic velocity ratio determines the range of efficiency of a turbine. The isentropic velocity ratio for a single-stage turbine is U/Co, where U (m/s) is the peripheral velocity of the blades, Co = (2 Ahr)? (m/s) is the isentropic spouting velocity, and Ahr (J/kg) is the enthalpy drop per unit mass of the working fluid through a turbine.

What is the typical range for design isentropic velocity ratios in two-row turbines used in specific engine cycles?,"These curves make it possible to establish and compare initial estimates of effi- ciency for turbines of new design. In practice, design isentropic velocity ratios for two-row turbines used in gas-generator and tap-off engine cycles (see Sect. 4.4) range from 0.1 to 0.4, and corresponding efficiencies vary from 35 to 65% [15]. Staged- combustion and expander-cycle turbines reach efficiencies above 80%, because the lower values of the turbine system pressure ratio po/p. permit operation in a range of velocity ratios corresponding to higher efficiency, as has been shown quantitatively in Sect. 4.8.. "
What is the range of peripheral velocities experienced by current turbine blades in meters per second?,"Peripheral velocities U of current turbine blades vary from 305 to 457 m/s, and associated inlet temperatures for liquid oxygen/RP-1 and for liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen turbines range from 811 to 1089 K. Rocket engine turbines have been operated successfully without cooling at inlet temperatures of 1200 K [15]."
What factors influence the number of stages in a newly designed turbine?,"The number of stages in a turbine of new design depends on the quantity of energy possessed by the unit mass of the working fluid and made available to the turbine. It also depends on a compromise between a gain in turbine efficiency and the added mass due to the further turbine stages required to increase performance. In a study of staging, pressure ratios and enthalpies per unit mass are varied in several possible configurations, to determine the design point corresponding to the highest efficiency with the smallest pitch diameter and the least number of stages. "
"What are the two types of axial turbines commonly used, and what design specification is often applied regarding impulse-type staging?",Current turbines are usually of the single-row or two-row axial type. This is due principally to size and mass restrictions affecting turbines used for rocket engines. Impulse-type staging is usually specified in turbines of new design with isentropic velocity ratios below 0.35. These turbines operate with high-energy working fluids and at pressure ratios which raise the stage spouting velocity into the supersonic domain. 
What type of turbine is generally selected for a direct-drive arrangement with a low pressure ratio and specific velocity characteristics?,"Reaction turbines are used with low pressure ratios (<2) and isentropic velocity ratios above 0.45 [15].  In a direct-drive arrangement, when the pumps and the turbine are mounted on a single shaft, the rotating speed w (rad/s) of the turbine and therefore the isentropic velocity ratio U/Co have values lower than the ideal ones. In this arrangement, a single-stage, two-row, velocity-compounded impulse turbine is generally chosen, as is the case with the Mark 10 turbo-pump illustrated in the following figure, adapted from [5].

What is the speed reduction ratio for the input and pump-shaft in the Mark 3 turbo-pump?,"By contrast, in a geared, offset-turbine arrangement, the presence of a gearbox makes it possible to operate the turbine at rotational speeds much higher than those which are possible with a direct-drive arrangement. For example, for the Mark 3 turbo-pump described at length in Sect. 4.5, the input rotational speed is 3434.8 rad/s, and the speed reduction ratio input/pump-shaft is 4.885 for both of the pumps [15]. Consequently, the Mark 3 turbo-pump has a two-stage, pressure-compounded impulse turbine.. "
"What properties of the working fluid, including specific heat ratio, are essential for determining the rotor size of an impulse turbine?","After the type of impulse turbine and the number of its stages have been deter- mined, it is necessary to determine the size of its rotor. To this end, it is necessary to know the properties (inlet temperature To, specific heat ratio y, etc.) of the working fluid, the pressure ratio po/p- of the turbine, and the rotation speed w of the pumps. "
What factors must be balanced when selecting the rotor tip diameter to optimize performance while managing size and stress levels?,"The rotor tip diameter d, (m) is chosen by taking account that a large diameter results in a high isentropic velocity ratio U/Co and a high efficiency 7, but also in high size, high mass, and high stresses in operating conditions. Therefore, the rotor tip diameter results from a compromise."
What factors must be summed to determine the useful power delivered by the turbine shaft?,"The useful power Py (W) delivered by the turbine shaft must be equal to the sum of the net power required by the pumps, the power loss in the gearbox (if any), and the power required by auxiliary drives. After the power resulting from this sum has been determined, the required mass flow rate my (kg/s) of the working fluid can be determined by using the following equation of Sect. 4.8:"

What transformation occurs to the working fluid's energy as it traverses through the pathways of an impulse turbine?,"The nozzles convert the potential energy of the working fluid into kinetic energy by reducing the temperature and the pressure of the fluid as it passes through the vane channels. The kinetic energy is then converted to work as the working fluid passes through the rotor blades [15]. The path followed by the working fluid through a two- row impulse turbine as that of the Mark 10 turbo-pump is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [22].  FLOW. "

What effects lead to the actual exit velocity of gas in a nozzle being lower than the velocity calculated under ideal expansion conditions?,"The expansion of a gas flowing through an actual nozzle is not isentropic, due to the viscosity of the working fluid, friction, boundary-layer effects, etc. The loss of kinetic energy due to friction and turbulence in the flow causes an increase in temperature (reheat) in the gas flowing through a nozzle. Therefore, the actual velocity C, of the gas at the exit of a nozzle is lower than its spouting velocity Co, which is calculated assuming an isentropic expansion. "

What effect does tapering a blade have on tensile stress at its root section due to centrifugal force?,"The loads acting on the rotor blades of a turbine are due to the following causes. The first cause is the centrifugal force acting on each blade. This force produces a tensile stress which reaches its maximum value at the root section of a blade. In order to reduce this stress, a blade can be tapered by making its section at the tip narrower than its section at the root. In addition, the centres of mass of the sections of a blade at various radii do not belong to a radial line. "
What generates maximum bending moments at a blade's root section due to centrifugal forces?,"Therefore, the centrifugal forces acting in these offset centres of mass of a blade generate bending moments, whose value is also maximum at the root section of the blade.. "
What factors contribute to the bending moment experienced by the blade in a turbine due to gas flow?,"The second cause is the bending moment due to the gas flow through the blades. The momentum change of the gas flow generates a force, which has a radial compo- nent, which drives the turbine, and an axial component. This force, in turn, generates a bending moment acting on the blade. For the purpose of determining this bending moment, the force due to the momentum change of the flowing gas can be considered as acting at the mid-height of the blade.. "
What design considerations are necessary to prevent significant bending stresses from vibrations in blade systems?,"The third cause is the bending moment due to a vibration force. This is because the gas flow through the blades is not uniform, but varies periodically between a maximum and a minimum value. The frequency of this force should not be equal to any of the natural frequencies of the blade, in order to avoid bending stresses of considerable magnitude. A careful design of the blades can offset part of the bending moment due to the gas flow by using the bending moment due to the centrifugal force. "
What formula represents the tensile stress at the root of a blade caused by centrifugal forces under specific conditions?," The tensile stress o, (N/m?) at the root section of a blade of constant cross- sectional area, without shroud, due to centrifugal forces, can be expressed as follows [41, p. 927, Eq.

"
How can the stresses at the root be calculated using the resultant moment acting on a structure?,The bending stresses at the root can be computed from the resultant bending moment.
How is the total stress from centrifugal forces calculated when a rotor blade includes a separation shroud?,"The vibration stresses can be estimated from data on blades designed previously. When a rotor blade is fitted with a separation shroud, the centrifugal force due to the shroud produces additional stress at the root. In this case, the total stress due to centrifugal forces results from summing the stress due to the blade to the stress due to the shroud."

However, the greater mean diameter of the former (1.083 m against 0.7424 m) implies greater size and mass."
"What types of bearings are utilized in turbo-pumps for their superior performance in load, speed, and stiffness?","The shaft of a turbo-pump is supported by two or more bearings. They are placed as closely as possible to major rotating components, in order to reduce radial movements and to control critical speeds. Ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings are used because of their capabilities in terms of load, speed, stiffness, and misalignment tolerances. Tapered roller bearings, needle bearings, and pure-thrust ball bearings  have not been used in rocket engine turbo-pumps, due to their limited speed capa- bilities [36]. "
What roles do bearings play in maintaining the position and alignment of components within a rotating shaft system?,"As has been shown in Sect. 4.2, the bearings are used to absorb the radial and axial loads transmitted through the shaft, to keep the rotating parts of the turbo-pump in position and in correct alignment with the fixed parts, and to permit the shaft to rotate with the least possible amount of friction. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12] shows the bearings (two forward bearings and one aft bearing) which support the shaft of the Mark 10 turbo-pump.

What are the two types of forces acting on the shaft of a turbo-pump in relation to its axis?,"Some of the forces acting on the shaft of a turbo-pump are directed radially, that is, perpendicularly to the shaft axis; others are directed along the shaft axis."
What factors contribute to radial forces in mechanical systems involving rotating components?,"The radial forces are due to the weights of components (such as shafts, impellers of pumps, rotors of turbines, and gears), to centrifugal forces acting on rotating parts, to forces of inertia caused by accelerations, to non-uniform distribution of pressure in the discharge volute of pumps, and to tangential forces caused by the presence of rotating gears."
"What factors contribute to axial forces in rotating machinery, particularly involving vertical shafts and turbine rotor blades?","The axial forces are due to weights of rotating parts mounted on a vertical shaft, to unbalanced axial thrust caused by the pumps, and to axial thrust acting on the blades of turbine rotors."
What advantages do ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings offer compared to fluid-film bearings in turbo-pumps of liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"As has been shown above, ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings are gener- ally used for turbo-pumps of liquid-propellant rocket engines. This is because they have the following advantages over fluid-film bearings:"
What are the characteristics of a system that allows for independent operation without external pressure and manages heat and lubricant effectiveness?,e ability to operate independently of external pressurising systems; e ability to operate satisfactorily after ingesting foreign material;¢ tolerance for short periods of coolant or lubricant absence;e high rate of radial spring; and  © low generation of heat and low consumption of coolant or lubricant.
What materials compose the races and rolling elements of a hybrid ball bearing?,"A hybrid ball bearing, with races made of 60NiTi alloy and balls made of Si3Na4, is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43]. By race we mean the track or channel in which the rolling elements ride."
What are the primary structural components distinguishing a ball bearing from a cylindrical roller bearing?,"Se caoraset National Aeronsutics and Space Admenistation ‘John H. Glenn Reseerch Genter et Lewis FiekdA ball bearing comprises an inner ring, an outer ring, and a plurality of balls placed between the two rings and held in their proper positions by a cage or separator. By contrast, in a cylindrical roller bearing, the rolling elements are cylinders of slightly greater length than diameter."
"What type of load can be supported by ball bearings designed for both radial and axial applications, and how does the assembly method affect their capacity?","Conrad-type ball bearings (so named after their inventor, Robert Conrad) are often used, because they can support a combined radial and axial load, a thrust load in both directions along the shaft axis, and moment loading. Their capacity depends on the number of balls used for them. This number is limited by the assembly method. They require a two-piece cage, which limits their speed capability [36].. "
What type of bearings are preferred for supporting heavy axial loads when a single bearing is insufficient?,"Split-inner-ring ball bearings and angular-contact bearings, which have 30% more capability to support thrust than Conrad-type bearings, are used singly or in tandem to support heavy axial loads. Tandem duplexed ball bearings are used when the thrust load is greater than the capability of a single bearing. Two or three bearings are used to share the loading [36].  Cylindrical roller bearings have several times the capacity to support radial loads and the stiffness of ball bearings. "
"What is the term used to measure bearing speed, calculated by multiplying the inner ring's diameter in millimeters with the shaft's rotation speed in revolutions per minute?","They are used to support only radial loads. Axial loads are supported by ball bearings axially connected to the roller bearing shaft. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [36], shows how a thrust-carrying ball bearing (right) is used to eliminate axial loads from a roller bearing (left).

"
What are the maximum DN values achieved for different types of bearings in operational turbo-pumps as specified in the reference?,Table III in [36] indicates the approximate maximum values of DN which have been achieved for bearings in operational turbo-pumps with specified coolants. These values range from 1.6 x 10° (for Conrad-type ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings) to 2.06 x 10° (for angular-contact ball bearings). The value of DN is proportional to the tangential velocity of the bearing at the inside diameter of the inner race. 
What are the potential failure modes for bearings when lubrication and cooling are inadequate due to excessive DV limits?,"When the maximum allowable limit of DV is exceeded, then lubrication and cooling are insufficient, and the bearing may fail due to overheating, contact wear, and fatigue. Since the value of DN is proportional to the shaft diameter, it depends on the bearing location. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12], shows the most common locations for bearings.  \ ; j 00 ‘\ ug. "

What is a benefit of mounting a pump and turbine on the same shaft in rocket engine turbo-pumps?,"The arrangement (a) of the preceding figure has frequently been used for rocket engine turbo-pumps in which the pump and the turbine are mounted on the same shaft. The J-2, RL10, and F-1 engines are examples of this arrangement, which has the advantage of avoiding the additional supporting structure and the separate lubrication and sealing systems which are required for the arrangements (b), (c), and (d).. "
What is the significance of sizing a shaft to ensure the turbo-pump speed remains below the critical speed in mechanical systems?,"For the arrangement (a), the shaft is often sized so that the turbo-pump speed is below the lowest value of the critical speed, which is that due to the simple shaft bending. This sizing is particularly important if the turbo-pump must operate over a wide range of operating speeds (throttling). Sobin et al. [12] indicate the following equation to estimate this limiting speed of the shaft:"
What is the empirical coefficient value for a single pump on the shaft using low-density fuel?,"1.053 (DN)? o = —-—— KpnP? where w (rad/s) is the rotational speed of the shaft, P (W) is the power on the shaft, and K py is a coefficient whose value, determined empirically, is 325 for one pump  on the shaft and low-density propellant (liquid hydrogen), 374 for one pump on the shaft and dense propellant, and 478 for two pumps on the shaft and dense propellant."
Where should the pump bearing be positioned to achieve a speed limit increase in relation to the pump components?,"Some increase in the speed limit can be obtained by placing the pump bearing between the inducer and the pump impeller, according to the arrangement (e) of the preceding figure, and using the inducer stator to support it."
How is the shaft diameter influenced by torsional stress when the turbine bearing is placed overboard?,"By placing the turbine bearing overboard, according to the arrangement (b) of the preceding figure, the shaft diameter can be sized by torsional stress. This results generally in a smaller shaft diameter, and therefore the turbo-pump can be designed for a higher speed. Sobin et al. [12] indicate the following equation to express the speed w (rad/s) as a function of the torsional stress which would occur in a solid shaft equal in diameter to the shaft diameter at the bearing:. "
What is the relationship between torsional stress and equivalent-shaft stress in solid shafts according to Sobin et al.?,"1 op = 4388 x 10-6r3,(DN)? P2 where Teg (N/m?) is the torsional stress of a solid shaft of the same outside diameter at the bearing. Sobin et al. [12] have found a good correlation with the final design by using a value of 1.724 x 10° N/m? for the equivalent-shaft stress."
Where should the bearing be positioned to achieve higher speeds and minimize the required diameter?,"Even higher speeds may be obtained by moving the bearing on the pump end to a location between the inducer and the impeller, according to the arrangement (c) of the preceding figure. This placement reduces the required bearing diameter by reducing the torque transmitted through the bearing bore."
Why might a main pump inducer be unnecessary when a boost pump is utilized in a pumping system?,"With a boost pump, a main pump inducer may not be needed, because the boost pump would provide sufficient net positive suction head for the main pump impeller. In this case, the pump bearing can be placed outboard, according to the arrangement (d) of the preceding figure."
What properties must the propellants possess for effective use in the bearings of turbo-pumps?,"The coolant and the lubricant used for the bearings of turbo-pump are often the propellants themselves. This practice has the advantage of eliminating a separate system of cooling and lubrication. A small quantity of the pumped propellant is bled from a region of high pressure of the pump, flows through the bearings, and re-enter into a region of low pressure of the pump. For this purpose, the propellants must be thermally stable at the operating temperature, chemically inert with the materials of which the bearings are made, and sufficiently viscous.. "
What factor is typically used to exceed the calculated Bjo fatigue life for bearings in turbo-pumps?,"The design data concerning the capacity to carry loads, the operating speed, and the life in service possessed by bearings are usually specified by their manufacturers. Table II in [36] contains a summary of capabilities possessed by bearings used for turbo-pumps of liquid-propellant rocket engines. The required life in service for a turbo-pump ranges usually from 1 to 2 h [36]. Bearings are designed for this life service by specifying a calculated Bjo fatigue life, including speed effects, which exceeds the turbo-pump life by an arbitrary arbitrary factor, whose value is usually set to 10. "
What does the Bjo fatigue life represent in terms of operational duration for bearings in relation to fatigue failure?,"This value is chosen not only to prevent fatigue failures, but also to compen- sate for other unquantifiable life-reducing factors, such as the low lubricity of most propellants and coolants. The Bjo fatigue life is the operating time which 90% of identical bearings can exceed without fatigue failure. It is calculated by relating the  stress cycles of a new design to the statistically analysed results of repeated fatigue tests on controlled test bearings [36].. "
What type of seals are specifically used in turbo-pumps to minimize the escape of fluids between moving and stationary components?,"The seals considered in this section are devices used in turbo-pumps of rocket enginesto prevent or reduce the leakage of propellants or other fluids between the rotatingparts (shaft, pump impeller, and turbine blades) and the stationary parts (stators and casing) of a turbo-pump. Therefore, only rotating seals are considered here."
What classification system is utilized for seals according to the criterion introduced by Zuk?,"Following the criterion proposed by Zuk [44], these seals can be classified into the"
What are the subcategories of seals that rely on the selection and management of the sealing area?,"The first category include the seals which depend on the selection and control of the sealing region. This category includes the following subcategories: © positive rubbing contact seals, which in turn include mechanical face seals,circumferential shaft riding seals, lip seals, and soft packing seals;"
What types of seals function effectively at minimal clearances between 0.025 cm and 0.25 cm?,"e seals which operate at close clearances (ranging from 0.025 to 0.25 cm), which in turn include hydrodynamic seals, hydrostatic seals, and floating bushing seals; and"
What are the two main categories of seals based on their design and operation related to fluid properties?,"e fixed clearance seals (where the seal is in the gap between the rotating shaft and the stationary sleeve), which in turn include fixed bushing seals and labyrinth seals.The second category includes the seals which depend on the control of properties of the fluid. This category includes the following subcategories: © controlled heating and cooling seals; and e ferromagnetic seals."
What are the subcategories of seals that rely on the regulation of forces exerted on the fluid?,The third category includes the seals which depend on the control of forces acting on the fluid. This category includes the following subcategories: © centrifugal seals;
"Which components mentioned in the text have been primarily employed in turbo-pumps for rocket engines, according to the referenced data?","This section describes briefly only those of the seals indicated above which have most frequently been used in turbo-pumps of rocket engines, according to the data given in Table 1 of [45]. The seals used in valves will be described in Chap. 5, Sect. 5.8."
What are the two main categories of mechanical face seals as demonstrated in the provided illustration?,"Two types of mechanical face seal are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [44].  SECONDARY SEAL 7 LOW PRES- fi SURE, Po ia f="" sean. He Ae “ INTERFACE (r Housinc or SEAL RING —) 3 | 3 = = t - =— See PTT"
What component ensures the sealing ring remains stationary while accommodating the axial movement of the rotating seal seat?,"On the left-hand side, a rotating seal seat is mounted to the shaft and is held in close vicinity of a non-rotating sealing ring. The sealing ring is held in close vicinity of the seat by a mechanical spring. The sealing ring is allowed to move axially to follow the axial motion of the seal seat, such as run-out. Anti-rotation lugs, not shown in the preceding figure, prevent sealing ring rotation. "
What is the function of the secondary seal in relation to the sealing ring's axial motions?,"Relative motion of the sealing ring and the stationary housing occurs across a secondary seal, which is shown as an O-ring in the preceding figure. The secondary seal may also be a piston ring, in case of high temperatures. The secondary seal fulfils the function of allowing the sealing ring to track axial motions of the seal seat. Since it is practically impossible to locate the seal seat to be perfectly perpendicular to the axis of rotation, then axial run-out occurs. "
What component allows for axial movement of a sealing element to accommodate run-out or wobble in a sealing application?,"In order to reduce the leakage due to this run-out, small axial movement of the sealing ring is allowed. In other words, the spring forces the sealing ring against the rotating seal seat to follow the run-out or wobble. The secondary seal and ring function may be combined into one integral unit, as shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure, where a bellows is used. The seal shown on the left is internally pressurised. "
What happens to the fluid pressure at the sealing interface during laminar flow of a viscous fluid?,"For this purpose, the pressurising fluid is located on the inner diameter of the seal and is separated from the low-pressure environment located at the outside diameter. By so doing, the pressurising fluid cannot leak to the external environment. The same seal is also pressure-balanced. At the primary sealing interface, leakage occurs and the pressure of the fluid decreases. In case of a laminar flow of a viscous fluid, the pressure decrease is linear, as shown in the preceding figure. "
What term describes the force resulting from a decrease in pressure that acts to separate the sealing ring from its seat?,"The force due to this pressure decrease is called the seal separating force. The spring force and a hydrostatic force, which act against the sealing ring, counterbalance the seal separating force and hold the sealing ring against the seal seat. . "
What are the primary components of circumferential shaft riding seals as indicated in the referenced figure?,"Two types of circumferential shaft riding seal are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [44].a yy r COVER RING "" Biss Es ~ SEAL RING “SL S\AUNG = AT = SS AXIAL GROOVES —, _ DAM ami) C7 . wees COVER RING > SECONDARY FacE PADS >”"
What is the purpose of the garter spring in the segmented sealing mechanism?,"The seal ring shown on the left-hand side of the preceding figure consists usually of three segments, in order to permit radial misalignment of the shaft and also the motion of the shaft, and still maintain a very small gap. A retainer cover prevents leakage of the segment joints, and a garter spring keeps the segmented seal rings in close vicinity of the seal shaft. The type of seal shown on the left-hand side of the preceding figure is completely unbalanced. "
What type of seals is used for applications involving significant axial movement and greater tolerance to pressure reversals?,"By contrast, the other type shown on the right-hand side of the same figure is partially pressure-balanced, because it has pressure-relief slots which result in only a small net unbalanced force in both the axial and the radial direction. Circumferential seals cannot be completely balanced. In addition, they are very sensitive to the installation. They are used when the shaft is subject to large axial movement, because they are more tolerant of pressure reversals than face seals.. "
"What is the purpose of a lip seal in mechanical design, particularly in aerospace applications?","A lip seal is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [44]. "
"What components make up a lip seal, and what is its primary function in relation to pressure differences?","A lip seal consists of the seal case, the stiffener ring, and the primary lip, which is held in close vicinity of the shaft by a garter spring. This type of seals is generally used for low or zero differences of pressure. For example, it is used to prevent an oil mist, which lubricates a bearing, from leaking to the external environment. Tip seals are cheap, compact, and easy to install. However, since they are made of elastomeric materials, the elastomer may be incompatible with the sealed fluid, and may also be subject to stress relaxation.. "
What are the primary functions of labyrinth seals in preventing fluid leakage?,"Six types of labyrinth seal are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [45]. They are fixed clearance devices which restrict fluid leakage by dissipating the kinetic energy of the flow through a series of constrictions and cavities, which accelerate or decelerate the fluid or change abruptly the direction of flow, to create the maximum friction and turbulence."
What type of labyrinth is designed to convert all kinetic energy during throttling into internal energy within its compartments?,"STRAIGHT LABYREM STeAtGHT US RINT Uae HTT Wy GOCU ABRADABLE STAGGERED LABYRINTH INTERLOCKING LABYRINTH WEAR-IN LABYRINTH  The ideal labyrinth transforms all the kinetic energy at each throttling into internal energy in each cavity. In practice, a labyrinth transfers a considerable amount of kinetic energy from one throttling to the next [45]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [15], shows the location of some of the seals described above in the A3-3 turbine of the RL-10 engine. "
What is the power transmission range for gear drives used in turbo-pumps of rocket engines as mentioned in the source?,"Seal Ci . tN hous {ng HB TES Lab —— S SS yrinth \ Criz ‘ ST seals Spring NNT eee 4 Sx 8 ie Rotating seal face at Sr e= fe —(O Seal a a = retainer <_ fl_| |. Metal seal arbon seal piston ring 4.14 Gears for Turbo-Pumps According to Hartman et al. [20], gear drives are used in turbo-pumps of rocket engines, with power transmitted ranging from 75 to 3356 kW, when: © pumps handling propellants whose densities are equal to or greater than 700 kg/m? are to be driven by small, high-speed turbines; and e a single turbine is to drive pumps handling propellants with greatly differing densities that require different pump speeds. "
"What are the names of the turbo-pumps or engines associated with the Atlas, Thor, Saturn IB, Titan II, Centaur, and Agena?"," The geared turbo-pumps or engines cited as examples in [20] are the Mark 3 (used for the Atlas, Thor, and Saturn IB boosters), the Mark 4 (used for the Atlas sustainer), the LR-87-AJ-5 (used for the first stage of the Titan II), the LR-91-AJ-5 (used for the second stage of the Titan II), the RL10 (used for the Centaur), and the LR81-BA-11 (used for the Agena). The gears used in these engines are shown in the following figure, adapted from [20]. "

"
"In rocket engines, how are fuel and oxidiser pumps arranged when using propellants with significant density differences?","Therefore, turbo-pumps of latest design have the pump connected directly to the turbine [12]. This is because, for rocket engines using propellants which do not differ much in density (for example, liquid oxygen and RP-1), the rotational speeds of the two pumps are about the same, and therefore the fuel pump and the oxidiser pump can be mounted on the same shaft, as in the F-1 engine. For rocket engines using propellants which differ widely in density (for example, liquid oxygen and  liquid hydrogen), the two pumps are mounted on separate shafts, each of them being driven by its own turbine, so that each pump can operate at its optimum rotational speed, as in the J-2 engine.. "
What method can be used to eliminate the inducer speed restriction caused by cavitation in a gear drive system?,"A gear drive may also be used to remove the inducer speed limit due to cavitation. This can be done by placing a low-speed pre-inducer to provide the required inlet pressure to the main inducer, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12]."

"What alternative driving methods, aside from a gear drive, can be used for a pre-inducer?","A pre-inducer may be driven not only by a gear drive, but also by other means, such as a through-flow hydraulic turbine drive, a re-circulated flow hydraulic turbine drive, an electric drive, and a gas turbine drive [12]."
What are the limitations regarding the size and speed of turbines in geared turbo-pumps?,"In general, geared turbo-pumps are restricted to those of small size, in which the turbine speed must be high enough to obtain reasonable blade heights, and in which multiple turbines would require excessive control elements in terms of size and mass [12]."
What are the three methods illustrated for gear mounting according to the figure provided?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [20] illustrates three methods for mounting gears. In this figure, D is the pitch diameter of the gear, d is the overhang distance, and S is the bearing span.  ee to 1.00 Ypy i] Y) oO —E=3 ==> | Ss 2d d - 2 S = 0.6D (a) Straddle mount (>) Overhung mount I\___eGear and bearing - (outer race rotates! aA_[2 Stationary shaft i (c) Mount for idler gear with single bearing The first method (straddle mount) is used whenever possible to reduce deflections under load, in order to avoid changes in centre distances and misalignment. "
What is a common use of the overhung mount method in engineering applications?,"The second method (overhung mount) is sometimes used to save space. An example is the turbine shaft of the Mark 4 turbo-pump used for the Atlas sustainer. The third method (mount for idler gear with single bearing) has been used on the RL10 gears. This method tolerates misalignment by rocking the ball bearing, so that the teeth of the idler gear line up with the teeth of the driving gear. The materials used in gears for turbo-pumps are similar to those used in gears for aircraft. "
What are the properties that make deep-carburised case-hardened steels suitable for power gears?,"Deep-carburised case-hardened steels similar to vacuum-melted AISI  9310 (also known as AMS 6265, which is a nickel-chromium-molybdenum case- hardening steel, with good strength and toughness properties) have been found to have the best combination of properties for power gears. This is because the hardened outer surface of this steel resists compressive stress and wear, and its tough ductile core resists shock loads and bending-stress cycle fatigue. "
What type of steel has been used to enhance the fatigue life of gears in turbo-pumps?,"The fatigue life of gears has been extended by using vacuum-melted steel. Asummary of the materials used in gears for turbo-pumps is given in the following table, due to the courtesy of NASA [20]. Application Lubricant/coolant Comments Critical, highly loaded | AMS 6265 MIL-L-60S6 oil Used where high power gears MIL-L-7SOB oil capacity and reliability MIIA-25336 oil are required; corrosion Fuel-additive* protection requited Moderately loaded AMS 6260 Same as above Used in applications less gears AISI 9310 critical than those above AISI 4620 Used for wear AISI 8620 resistance; must have AMS 6470 smooth edge radii to (nitrided) avoid edge chipping; must have protection from moisture corrosion Lightly loaded gears | Any of the above, | Same as above Used for accessory plus gears AISI 4340 AISI 4140 Propellant-cooled AMS 6260 LH2, LO, RP-1 Gear material must be gears, moderately or | AMS 6265 protected from lightly loaded corrosion by moisture.

What defines a dynamical system and how does its behavior change in relation to external stimuli?,"The engine of a rocket vehicle is a particular case of a dynamical system. By system we mean a collection of parts or elements or components which work together to attain an object. By dynamical system we mean a system whose behaviour changes with time in response to an external stimulus or force. In case of an engine of a rocket vehicle, the object of the system is the generation of a thrust vector having the desired magnitude and direction.. "
What term is commonly used to refer to the processor in a dynamical system that converts incoming signals into outgoing signals?,"A dynamical system has inputs (or signals coming in), outputs (or signals going out), and an internal processor which transforms inputs into outputs. The part of a dynamical system which transforms inputs into outputs, that is, the processor of signals, is also known as the plant. The plant is the part of a dynamical system which fulfils the function of receiving, handling, and emitting signals."
What graphical representation uses boxes for components and lines for signals in the context of a dynamical system?,"A dynamical system is usually represented graphically by means of a block diagram, in which lines indicate input or output signals, and boxes indicate the plant or other components of the system, as shown in the following figure."
"What is the classification of dynamical systems that encompasses vehicles like rockets, which rely on the performance of multiple components or subsystems for mission outcomes?","In case of a rocket vehicle, the success or the failure of the mission of the vehicle depends on the outputs of the various components or subsystems of which the system is made. Therefore, a rocket vehicle belongs to a particular class of dynamical systems, which are called controlled systems."
What does the process of managing a dynamical system involve to achieve desired outcomes in engineering applications?,"Controlled systems exist in several fields of engineering. Controlling a dynamical system means regulating, or commanding, or governing that system in order to reach © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license 447 to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A. de Iaco Veris, Fundamental Concepts of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines,"

A control system is an arrangement of components connected one to another for the purpose of regulating the system itself or another system to be controlled by the first."
What term describes a control system that does not modify its operation based on feedback from its output?,"A control system which cannot adjust itself or another system to input signals received is called an open-loop system. An open-loop system is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [1], which illustrates two systems which are connected between them, because the output signals u of the first (controller) are also the input signals of the second, which is the controlled system. Therefore, the first system controls the second system, but is not controlled by it. "
What type of control system is characterized by the output signal not influencing the input to the control process?,"There is no mutual control of one system over the other. In other words, a system whose output signal y has no effect upon the input to the control process is called an open-loop control system.. "
What term describes a control system that modifies itself or another system based on input signals?,"Acontrol system which can adjust itself or another system to input signals is called a closed-loop or feedback system. A closed-loop system is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [1], which illustrates two systems which have mutual control one over the other."
What is the purpose of feeding back a function of the output in a control system?,"In other words, a closed-loop control system is a control system in which some function of the output y of some part of the system is fed back as a secondary input which adds to the primary input r to the system, so as to affect the response of the system itself. As an example of a control system for a rocket vehicle, Lorenzo and Musgrave [2] describe a pressure-fed bi-propellant engine, in which the propel- lants are kept under pressure in their respective tanks and then supplied to the main combustion chamber through appropriate feed lines, control valves, and injector elements, as has been shown in Chap. 3. The propellants are to be delivered to the main combustion chamber in a determined mixture ratio. "
How is the thrust of a rocket engine regulated by adjusting the combustion chamber's pressure and the ratio of oxidiser to fuel mass flow rates?,"fms where mz, and rity are the mass flow rates of respectively the oxidiser and the fuel, and at a total mass flow rate mm, = m, +m, related to the desired thrust. The control system of this rocket engine regulates the thrust by controlling the pressure p, of the gas in the combustion chamber and the mixture ratio o/f of the two propellants, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [2].  -. O Mixture Ratio Control Teall my | P c % supply Chamber Pressure (Thrust) Control a O “set z. "
What is the primary purpose of the fast loop in the control scheme regarding the mixture ratio of propellants?,"The preceding scheme has two control loops. One of them controls the mixture ratio o/f of the propellants, and the other controls the pressure p, of the gas in the combustion chamber. The first loop operates usually, but not necessarily, on the propellant supplied at higher mass flow rate than the other. This loop is tuned to be the fast loop. This reduces excursions in the mixture ratio away from the set point, which in turn keeps the temperatures of the gas and of the metal at the design conditions. "
What defines the bandwidth of the slow loop in relation to the thrust response demands?,"The second loop, which controls the pressure of the gas in the combustion chamber, is the slow loop, and its bandwidth is set by thrust response requirements. The type of control shown above requires three measurements (p¢, 7, and my) and two control inputs for the valve areas A, and A, [2].. "
What are the limitations of an open-loop control system in terms of adapting to changing operational parameters?,"An open-loop control system for a rocket engine is calibrated to a fixed set of conditions, and uses orifices and on-off command devices to correct deviations of some parameters from their design values. For example, orifices of proper size are inserted into the flow lines to command pressure drops, and the mass flow rates of the propellants are controlled by opening or closing valves. An open-loop control system is simple, but is also limited to a specific set of parameters, and cannot compensate for variable conditions. "
What role do sensors play in a closed-loop control system?,"The sequence times in an open-loop control system are often established by means of interlocks.  A closed-loop control system uses sensors, computers to detect errors (which are differences between a given reference signal r and the output y of the system), and actuation commands u generated by the computers to correct the errors. Therefore, a closed-loop control system does not require calibration for a specific set of conditions. "
What type of control mechanism adjusts outputs based on the difference between a reference signal and the actual system output in rocket engines?,"It requires sensors and computers to detect errors and take appropriate steps to correct them. A closed-loop control system is often used in a rocket engine to control the mixture ratio o/f of the propellants, and the thrust vector F in magnitude and direction. A closed-loop control system in a rocket engine may operate in one of the modes indicated below. (1) On-off control, which can be described as follows: ua | timax ife>0 ~ | umin if e < 0 where the control error e = r — y is the difference between the reference signal r and the output y of the system, and uw is the actuation command. "
What value is assigned to the actuation command u when the control error e is equal to zero?,"The preceding equation does not define a value of the actuation command u when the control error e is equal to zero. In practice, u is taken equal to zero (u = 0) when the control error e is in a narrow band centred around e = 0. The on-off control is used for a rocket engine, for example, when a pressure switch opens or closes a valve which regulates the pressure in a tank. (2) Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, which can be described as follows: Umax if @ > max u=ykpe if emin < @ < @max Umin if e < emin where k, is the controller gain, @min = Umin/kp, and @max = Umax/kp. "
What is the term used to describe the range where the controller acts linearly with respect to the error in a proportional control system?,"The interval (€min, @max) is called the proportional band, because the behaviour of the controller is linear when the error e = r — y is in this interval, as follows u=k,(r—y)=kpe if emin < @ < €max In a proportional control, the process variable often deviates from a reference value. When some level of the control signal u is required for the system to maintain a desired value, then the control error e must be other than zero to generate the required value. "
What type of control results in zero steady-state error by making the control signal proportional to the integral of the error over time?,"For this purpose, the control signal u is made proportional to the integral of the error over a given time interval, as follows t u(t) = k; | e(t)dt 0  where k; is the integral gain. This type of control is called integral control. A controller with integral control has zero steady-state error [1].. "
What are the components combined in a controller to create a PID controller for managing system oscillations?,"Unfortunately, there may not always be a steady state, because the system may be subject to oscillations. In this case, a controller can be made able to predict the error e some time Ty ahead of the present time f, by using the following linear extrapolationBy combining proportional, integral, and derivative control, it is possible to obtain a PID controller based on the following equation"
"What factors contribute to the control signal u(t) based on present, past, and future errors?","By so doing, the control signal u(t) results from the sum of three terms: the term relating to the present time is proportional, through the coefficient k,, to the error at the present time; the term relating to the past time is proportional, through the coefficient k;, to the error cumulated over an interval before the present time; and the term relating to the future time is proportional, through the coefficient ky, to the error resulting from a linear extrapolation of the error at some time ahead of the present time [1]. "
"What are the three main components of a control system used in a rocket engine, and what do they specifically regulate?","The proportional-integral-derivative control is used for a rocket engine in several cases, for example, to control the pressure in the combustion chamber (proportional term), or the mixture ratio of the propellants (integral term), or the direction of the thrust vector with phase lead (derivative term). An example of a closed-loop control system for a rocket engine has been given by Huzel and Huang [3] by means of the following scheme, re-drawn from [3].. "
What components are involved in regulating pressure within a turbopump system?,"G A £ GG TURBOPUMP COMMAND REFERENCE GG FLOW | fi, p, [ THRUST REFERENCE —> PRESSURE }—1>(}—>>>1 ""1 contro [>] Fremnesren NO LTS F PRESSURE p, | TRANSDUCER baad VALVE CHAMBER NOZZLE CHAMBER PRESSURE TRANSDUCER ® ELECTRIC SUMMING JUNCTION > ELECTRIC AMPLIFIER"
What is the primary objective of the control system regarding pressure in a combustion chamber?,"This control system illustrated above has the purpose of maintaining the value p. of the pressure in the combustion chamber equal to a desired value p, of reference, by using a valve which controls the value m, of the mass flow rate in the gas generator (GG). The magnitude F of the thrust vector is controlled indirectly, by regulating the pressure p, in the combustion chamber. "
What components are necessary for a control system that regulates mass flow rate in a gas generator?,"This control system consists of a sensor (chamber pressure transducer), a computer containing an electric summing junction and an electric amplifier, and a controller (gas generator flow control valve) which regulates the value of the mass flow rate m in the gas generator. The computer compares the reference input signal r with the input signal y coming from the sensor (chamber pressure transducer). "
How are the signals r and y mathematically connected to their respective pressures within the combustion chamber via differential equations?,"The signal r is related to the reference pressure p,, and the signal y is related to the actual pressure Pc in the combustion chamber through differential equations, which describe the behaviour of the components of the system.. "
What symbols represent the relationships between input and output in control system equations?,"The letters A, B, C, and D in the preceding figure indicate the relations existing between the input and the output of the respective components. The equations which govern this control systems can be written symbolically as follows"
What techniques can be utilized to ensure stability and avoid overshooting in a system's response while adjusting control parameters?,"The behaviour of this control system results from the solution of the preceding equations. These equations are usually solved by using the method of the Laplace transformation (see, for example, [4]). The values to be given to the gains and to the response lags of a control system are to be chosen carefully, sometimes by trial and error, in order not to introduce overshoots or other causes of instability, which could give rise to large oscillations.. "
What functions do control systems serve in liquid-propellant rocket engines during operation and in the event of a malfunction?,"The control systems described in general terms in the preceding section are used inliquid-propellant rocket engines to perform some or all of the following tasks:© engine restart, in case of engines having restart capability;e change of the given plan of operation, or even engine shutdown, in the presence of a malfunction;"
What components are utilized to cool cryogenic propellants during preparation for launch?,"e incase of cryogenic propellants, chilling pipes, pumps, cooling jackets, injectors, and valves by bleeding the cold propellants through them;"
What processes are involved in ensuring critical components function correctly prior to a flight and preparing engines for reuse?,"e check-out the proper operation of critical components before flight; ande incase of recoverable and reusable engines, recycling and refurbishing the engines to put them in conditions of readiness for a new use."
What types of mechanisms are primarily employed to manage control functions in liquid-fueled rocket propulsion systems?,"In the specific case of liquid-propellant rocket engines, most of the actuators used for control functions are valves, regulators, pressure switches, and flow controls. Special computers for automatic control in large engines are also commonly used [5]."
What type of controls are implemented to ensure the protection of personnel and equipment during equipment failures?,"In addition, safety controls are used to protect personnel and equipment in case of malfunctions, and check-out controls make it possible to test the operation of critical components of a rocket engine without actually firing the engine."
What are the main processes involved in initiating a rocket engine from the point of receiving a start signal to achieving full operational capacity?,"The start sequence of a rocket engine has the purpose of controlling the engine from the moment in which the start signal is given to the full operation of the main stage. This sequence includes the steps of preparation (thrust chamber purging and chill-down of propellant transfer lines), application of start energy (start tanks and turbine spinner), and introduction followed by ignition of the propellants in the main combustion chamber. "
What factors influence whether a propulsion system employs an oxidiser-lead or fuel-lead opening sequence?,"Secondary start sequences may be needed for some subsystems, as is the case with a gas generator or a pre-burner. A start sequence is regulated by means of interlocks, and by monitoring each step of the sequence. The opening sequence of the propellant valves may perform either an oxidiser-lead or a fuel-lead start, depending on the combination of propellants chosen, on the method used to ignite the propellants, and on the method used to cool the thrust chamber. "
What is the duration range of start delay time for small thrusters in seconds?,"The start delay time is the time necessary to purge the engine, open the valves, initiate the combustion, and increase the pressure in the combustion chamber to the rated value. This time is usually small (from 0.003 to 0.015 s in small thrusters) for an engine fed by gas under pressure, in which the pressurisation system has to be activated and the ullage volume has to be put under pressure before the start. "
What factors contribute to the increased ignition time of an engine powered by turbo-pumps compared to a pressure-fed engine?,"An engine fed by turbo-pumps requires more time to start (from | to 5 s), because it is necessary not only to execute the operations indicated above for a pressure-fed engine, but also to start a gas generator or a pre-burner, and to increase the speed of the turbo-pumps to a level in which the combustion can be firstly self-sustained and then brought to its full extent. When the combination of propellants used in a rocket engine is not hypergolic, additional time is necessary for the igniter to work and for the control function to confirm the proper operation of the igniter. The ignition methods used for liquid-propellant rocket engines have been discussed in Chap. 2, Sects. 2.7 and 2.8.. "
What are the two scenarios in which the shutdown sequence is executed?,"The shutdown sequence is executed either in normal operating conditions or in cases of emergency. This is done by shutting off the flow to the gas generator (or to the pre-burner) and to the main combustion chamber. In case of test firings, the shutdown sequence also includes purges and flushes for post-firing safety. The control system regulates the valve closing sequence in such a way as to provide a fuel-rich cut-off in the main combustion chamber. "
"What sequence occurs during the termination of thrust, specifically regarding the closure of the gas generator valve?","This prevents high picks of temperature and  results in a smooth and rapid termination of the thrust. The valves close in a fixed sequence. The valve controlling the gas generator or the pre-burner closes first. The pressurisation in the propellant tanks is stopped. The pumps slow down, as a result of the decrease in the gas flow through the turbine. The pressures and the mass flow rates of the propellants decrease quickly and reduce to zero.. "
"What components govern the starting, operation, and shutdown characteristics in the main engines of the Space Shuttle?","In the three main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, the characteristics of start, run, and shutdown are established by the combined actions of the main fuel valve, the main oxidiser valve, the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve, the fuel pre- burner oxidiser valve, and the chamber coolant valve. These valves are powered by hydraulic actuators which receive positioning signals from the engine controller, which in turn uses performance data gathered by sensors located throughout the engine. "
What does the functional scheme illustrate regarding the flow of propellant in the RS-25 propulsion system?,"A functional scheme showing the propellant flow through the RS-25 engine and the valves named above is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Wikimedia [6].. "
What is the purpose of a pressurant turbopump in a propulsion system?,"GH? pressure G02 pressurant turbopump | t f | oxidizer ms stain IK turbopump == mer injector = AEs mi 3) t \ ) =, yf Oxidizer heat fuel turbopump Diver QUA 105) ) High pressure B&H = y —_ oxidizer turbopumy.

"What is the thrust range of the Space Shuttle main engine during its operation, from minimum to full power levels?","With reference to the preceding figure, the main oxidiser valve, the main fuel valve, and the chamber coolant valve are switched to run schedules during the engine run phase, while the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve and the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve are switched to closed-loop operations. The run schedule for the main oxidiser valve and for the main fuel valve cause them to simply remain fully open, whereas the run schedule for the chamber coolant valve drives it between half open at 67% thrust (minimum power level) and fully open at 100% thrust and above (in the Space Shuttle main engine, the thrust is variable between the minimum power level or 67% to the full power level or 109%, the rated or 100% value being 2.094 x 10° N in vacuo and 1.667 x 10° N at sea level). "
What components are adjusted to control thrust and mixture ratio in an engine during operation?,"This action maintains the appropriate  flow relationships among the several parallel fuel flow paths, as the high-pressure fuel turbo-pump output pressure varies with thrust. During engine run, the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve and the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve are used as control devices for thrust and mixture ratio. Manipulating the valves affects the output of the pre-burners, the speed of the turbo-pumps, and therefore the propellant flow rates. "
How does the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve operate in relation to the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve when adjusting thrust while preserving the mixture ratio?,"The fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve is driven alone to maintain mixture ratio in the main combustion chamber, while the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve is driven with the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve to increase or decrease thrust while maintaining the mixture ratio. The control loops include the controller, the valve actuators, and the transducers which sense the flow rates and the pressure in the main combustion chamber, and therefore the thrust. "
What is the effect of establishing a fuel lag during the engine shutdown process?,"During the engine shutdown phase, all five valves are switched to shutdown schedules. These schedules ensure a smooth and safe shutdown by establishing a fuel lag. In other words, the oxidiser leaves the combustion chambers ahead of the fuel. This lag creates a fuel-rich and cool shutdown environment [7].. "
What functions does the controller of the engine perform in relation to maintenance and operation monitoring?,"The controller of the RS-25 engine provides complete and continuous moni- toring and control of engine operation. In addition, it performs maintenance and start preparation checks, and collects data for historical and maintenance purposes. The controller of the RS-25 engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [7]."
What are the five main components included in the electronic package of the controller?,The controller is an electronic package which contains five principal sections:
Describe the components that enable interaction between a user and a digital computing system.,© computer interface section; and e digital computer unit.
What are the operational modes of a dual-redundant controller after failures and how do they differ in functionality?,"Pressure, temperature, pump speed, flow rate, and position sensors supply the input signals. Output signals operate spark igniters, solenoid valves, and hydraulic  actuators. The controller is dual-redundant, which gives it normal, fail-operate, and fail-safe operational mode capability. Fail-operate mode follows a first failure, and is similar to normal mode, but with a loss of some redundancy. Fail-safe mode follows a second failure. "
What mechanisms are used to regulate engine thrust and fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during operation?,"In this mode, engine throttling and mixture ratio control are suspended, the main propellant valves are held fixed in their last commanded position, and the engine is subsequently shutdown pneumatically. The controller provides active and continuous control of the engine thrust and of the mixture ratio in the main combustion chamber through closed-loop control. The controller reads the pressure (equivalent to the thrust) in the main combustion chamber, and compares it to the existing thrust reference signal. "
What functions does the controller perform beyond adjusting the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve?,"It uses the error to drive the oxidiser pre-burner oxidiser valve, which adjusts the thrust and eliminates the error. For the mixture ratio in the main combustion chamber, the controller reads the fuel flow-meter and drives the fuel pre-burner oxidiser valve to adjust the fuel flowing to the main combustion chamber, thus maintaining a mixture ratio o/f = 6. In addition to these primary functions, the controller performs engine checkout, limit monitoring, start readiness verification, and engine start and shutdown sequencing. "
How often are the controller instructions to the engine control components refreshed in a given time frame?,"The controller instructions to the engine control elements are updated 50 times per second (every 20 ms). The electronics are mounted on modular boards inside a sealed and pressurised chassis, which is cooled by heat convection through pin fins [7].. "
"How can the force generated by a rocket engine be adjusted during flight, particularly in the final phase?","The thrust of a rocket engine is controlled in magnitude by regulating the pressure in the main combustion chamber. Sometimes, a reduction of the thrust magnitude, also known as throttling, is necessary in the last part of the propelled flight of a rocket vehicle. This reduction can be performed by decreasing, either stepwise or continuously, the pressure in the main combustion chamber."
How can the pressure in a rocket engine's combustion chamber be decreased when utilizing turbo-pumps?,"Incase of rocket engines fed by turbo-pumps, the pressure in the main combustion chamber can be reduced by regulating either the mass flow rate of the propellants through the gas generator or the mass flow rate of the hot gas through the turbine. When the first method is used, it is also possible to vary the mixture ratio of the propellants."
How can the pressure in a rocket engine's combustion chamber be decreased in systems utilizing pressurized gases?,"In case of rocket engines fed by gases under pressure, the pressure in the combus- tion chamber can be reduced by regulating the pressures in the main tanks of the propellants.In case of multiple engines arranged in a cluster, thrust control can be performed by shutting off one or more engines of the cluster."
What method is employed to adjust the thrust magnitude in a rocket engine utilizing turbo-pumps?,"The examples of thrust regulation considered in Sect. 5.1 concern the case of a rocket engine fed by gases under pressure and the case of a rocket engine fed by turbo-pumps. In the second case, the thrust has been controlled in magnitude by using a valve regulating the value of the mass flow rate in the gas generator, and therefore the power delivered by the turbine.  The example given below concerns thrust regulation performed by varying the flow of the propellants. "
What are the components involved in a closed-loop control system focused on flow variation management?,"The following, figure, re-drawn from [3], illustrates the scheme of a closed-loop control system based on flow variation. MIXTURE RATIO CONTROL OXIDISER VALVE VERNIER POSITION ACTUATOR | THRUST THROTTLE CONTROL CHAMBER COMMAND THRUST ae asics REFERENCE r | <2 p—|¢,| THROTTLE Pe ies CONTROL CHAMBER nur [Lp J | seruaren} age VALVE PRESSURE TRANSDUCER () ELECTRIC SUMMING JUNCTION [> ELECTRIC AMPLIFIER. "
What device measures the pressure in the combustion chamber and informs the thrust throttle control computer?,"In the present case, the regulation is based on two valves which determine the resistances encountered by the two different propellants in their respective lines towards the combustion chamber. A chamber pressure transducer senses the pressure Pc in the combustion chamber, which is used as an indicator of the thrust magnitude. The output signal y of the chamber pressure transducer is fed back as a secondary input to the thrust throttle control computer, which compares the signal y with its primary input, which is the reference signal r. "
How does the error calculated by the difference between r and y influence the operation of the thrust throttle control actuator?,"The error e = r — y is used to drive the thrust throttle control actuator, which in turn regulates the control valves of the propellants in such a way as to reduce the error.. "
How is the mixture ratio of propellants controlled in the main combustion chamber of a specific engine type?,"In the RS-25 engine, throttling is accomplished by varying the output of the pre- burners, thus varying the speed of the high-pressure turbo-pumps, and therefore the mass flow rates of the propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen). The mixture ratio of the propellants in the main combustion chamber is o/f = 6.032. This value is maintained by varying the fuel flow rate around the oxidiser flow rate [7]. "
How does limiting the oxidiser flow to pre-burners affect the temperature at the turbine inlet?,"In other words, restricting the oxidiser flow to the pre-burners causes the turbine inlet temperature to decrease.  5.4 Control of Propellant Mixture Ratio. "
What method can enhance the accuracy of propellant mixture ratios before rocket launch?,"An open-loop control system of the mixture ratio of the propellants in a rocket engine can be obtained by installing calibration orifices of proper size in the propellant lines. Further refinements are possible by weighing accurately the propellants loaded in the tanks, by using orifices of adjustable (rather than fixed) size in case of storable fluids, in order to regulate the size of the orifices just before take-off, and by installing valves at the pump inlet of engines fed by turbo-pumps, in order to compensate for effects induced by accelerations acting on the fluid mass. "
How does a closed-loop control system utilize fluid pressure variations to manage valve operation and safeguard pump functionality?,"In the last manner, an increase or decrease in pressure in the fluids due to variable accelerations is sensed and fed back to a closed-loop control system, which regulates gradually the valves and also protects the pumps.. "
What is the purpose of a closed-loop system in maintaining the mixture ratio?,"In certain cases, it is necessary to perform a continuous control of the mixture ratio by using a closed-loop system. In such cases, Huzel and Huang [3] suggest the control scheme shown in the following figure.CONTROL = 1 CONTROL COMPUTER FUEL FLOW, Yep (ality Xe pli m FLOWMETER a VALVE VERNIER VALVE POSITION ACTUATOR OXIDISER FLOW FLOWMETER to"
What component in the control system adjusts the oxidiser mass flow rate to rectify the error between feedback and reference signals?,"The control system illustrated in the preceding figure has two flow-meters which sense continuously the mass flow rates m, and m, of the propellants. The mixture ratio feedback signal (tit, /my ) , is compared in a computer with areference command signal (rit,/ri), and the resulting error (ri,/riv), is fed to a mixture ratio control oxidiser valve Vernier position actuator. This actuator, in turn, commands the oxidiser control valve, which varies the mass flow rate 7, of the oxidiser, in such a way as to correct the error.. "
"What are the flow rates that a flow-meter can measure, and what type of flow-meter is used for each measurement method?","A flow-meter is a device which measures either the volume flow rate g (m?/s) or the mass flow rate 7 (kg/s) of a fluid which passes through it. A volumetric flow- meter (such as a positive displacement flow-meter) measures the volume flow rate q = Av of a fluid stream which passes through a cross-sectional area A (m7) at a velocity v (m/s). A velocity flow meter (such as a magnetic, turbine, ultrasonic, and  vortex shedding and fluidic flow-meter) measures the velocity v of a fluid stream to determine the volume flow rate g. "
"What formula relates density, volume flow rate, and mass flow rate in fluid dynamics?","When the volume flow rate q is known, the mass flow rate 72 results from 1 = pq, where p (kg/m*) is the density of the fluid in the given conditions.. "
What type of flow-meter design incorporates a hemispherical hub and utilizes a turbine mechanism for measurement?,"A turbine-type flow-meter having a hemispherical hub is illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [8].Rotor nw ~ WV WEAN Shaft supports a | | ol eee ciiaaaii straigiontes=7 aay ZY"
What phenomenon occurs in a turbine-type flow-meter when the fluid stream interacts with a bladed rotor?,"A turbine-type flow-meter is a device in which the entire flow stream turns a bladed rotor at a speed proportional to the volume flow rate of the fluid, and which generates or modulates an output signal, whose frequency is proportional to the angular velocity of the rotor. As shown in the preceding figure, the fluid passing through the flow-meter impinges on the blades of a turbine, which are free to rotate about an axis along the central line of the turbine housing. "
"What phenomenon occurs when a blade moves through a magnetic field, resulting in the generation of an electrical cycle within a coil?",A permanent magnet placed within the windings of a pickoff coil generates a magnetic field. An electrical cycle is generated by each blade which sweeps through the magnetic field present in the fluid passage.. 
What method is employed to regulate the use of propellant in relation to the levels in storage containers?,"Another flow-meter, based on the Venturi tube, will be described in Sect. 5.7. Further information on several types of flow-meters can be found in [9]. 5.5 Control of Propellant Consumption This type of control is performed by sensors which measure the amount of propellant remaining in the tanks and the unbalance of one of the two propellants with respect to the other. A closed-loop scheme indicated by Huzel and Huang [3] is shown in the following figure. "
What is the role of an electric summing junction in controlling propellant use within a mixture computer system?, PROPELLANT USE CONTROL REFERENCE TRANSDUCER f MIXTURE COMPUTER fr | COMPUTER TRANSDUCER ® ELECTRIC SUMMING JUNCTION D> ELECTRIC AMPLIFIER. 
How do sensors contribute to monitoring the individual masses of two propellants in a control system?,"This control system measures continuously the residual masses my and m, of the two propellants by using sensors placed in the respective tanks. The transducer output signals yy and y, corresponding to these masses are summed, and the signal resulting from the sum yr + yo is compared with a propellant use control reference signal r which is fed to the propellant use control computer."
What transformation is applied to the error signal before it influences the command reference mixture ratio signal?,"The error signal e = r — (yy + y,) is amplified and then used to modify the command reference mixture ratio signal (rity /m Np which is fed to the mixture ratio control computer."
Which types of sensors are typically employed to measure the quantity of propellant within a storage tank?,A survey on the sensors used to determine the amount of propellant contained in a tank has been performed by Dodge [10]. A brief account is given below.
What are the primary types of elements used in sensors for detecting fluid presence in a tank?,"Sensors detecting the presence of fluids of a given type at given locations in a tank are usually called wet-dry sensors. Most wet-dry sensors are based on a hot wire or an electrical resistance or an electrical impedance element which carries a small current. The presence of a given type of fluid at the sensor location is detected by a change in the electrical impedance of the sensor, which in turn depends on the type of fluid (gas or liquid) around the sensor. "
How does the surrounding medium affect the heat transfer and impedance of a sensor when electric current flows through it?,"This is because the sensor impedance depends on the amount of heat transfer from the sensor to the surrounding medium, due to the heating caused by the passage of the electric current. The heat transfer is greater when the sensor is surrounded by a liquid. Thus, by measuring a change in current for a constant applied voltage or a change in voltage for a constant applied current, it is possible to detect whether the sensor is in a liquid or in a gas.. "
What type of sensor utilizes a laser light source within a prism to detect variations in liquid levels?,"Another type of sensor is based on a laser light source incorporated in a prism-like capsule, whose index of refraction is matched to the index of refraction of the liquid contained in a tank. A scheme of this optical sensor is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [10].  Light source Liquid Gas __ \ == Prism ff Photocell ~"
What indicates the state of the sensor when the light behavior changes between reflection and transmission?,"When the sensor is immersed in a gas, as shown on the left-hand side of the preceding figure, the light is reflected off the end of the prism back to a photocell at the light source. By contrast, when the sensor is immersed in a liquid, as shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure, the light is transmitted through the liquid without reflection off the prism. Thus, the presence or absence of a reflection indicates whether the sensor is dry or wet.. "
What types of devices are used to measure the height of a liquid within a container?,"Sensors which detect the location of the surface of a liquid in a tank or the depth of this liquid above the sensor are called level sensors. In this category are pressure sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and electrical capacity sensors."
How does the depth of a liquid relate to the pressure difference measured by a sensor in a tank?,"Pressure sensors cannot be used in weightless conditions, because they measure the pressure head p/(pgo) of the liquid placed above the location of the sensor. A pressure transducer is inserted at the bottom of a gauge line going from the bottom to the top of a tank. A pressure sensor detects the difference of pressure existing between the gas at the top and the liquid at the bottom of the tank. This difference is related to the depth of the liquid when the pressure and the temperature of the substance (liquid or gas) are known.. "
How is the sonic velocity in a liquid related to the depth measurement during an ultrasonic sensor operation?,"Ultrasonic sensors generate an ultrasonic pulse which is transmitted through the liquid propellant contained in a tank. A mismatch of acoustic impedance at the liquid- gas interface generates an echo, which is transmitted back through the liquid to an ultrasonic receiver at the transducer location. The time elapsed between the emission of the pulse and the reception of the echo is related to the depth of liquid above the transducer by the sonic velocity in the liquid. "
What device is utilized to keep a liquid in a specific arrangement above a sensor in low-gravity environments?,"A sensor of this type can be used in low- gravity conditions, but the liquid must be maintained in a known configuration above the sensor by a propellant management device based on the principle of capillarity.. "
How does the environment surrounding a torsional wave guide affect the propagation speed of ultrasonic waves?,"An ultrasonic sensor of another type is a torsional wave guide. In this sensor, the speed of a torsional wave propagating along a wave guide, such as a rod, depends on whether the wave guide is immersed in a liquid or ina gas. The impedance mismatch at the liquid-gas interface generates an echo, which is detected to provide information on the length of the wave guide which is immersed in the liquid. "
How does the presence of liquid on specific components affect the performance of the sensor in a zero-gravity environment?,"However, some tests executed in conditions of zero gravity have shown that the adherence of liquid to portions of the wave guide supposed to be dry degraded seriously the accuracy of the sensor..

What is the role of a capacity sensor in monitoring the contents of a propellant tank?,"A capacity sensor contained in a propellant tank is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11].

Section O°"
What does a capacity probe measure directly through changes in electric capacity due to different dielectric constants of its contents?,"A capacity probe senses mass directly. The sensing probe consists essentially of two coaxial tubes contained in a tank. These tubes, when a voltage is applied to them, act as the plates of an electric condenser, whose capacity changes when the proportion between liquid and gas changes. This is because the liquid and the gas contained in the tank have different values of dielectric constant. In other words, the dielectric medium between the two tubes of the probe is the propellant, in liquid and gaseous state, contained in the tank. "
How does the level of liquid in a probe influence its electrical capacity measurement?,"The total electrical capacity of the probe depends on the level of the liquid which fills it. Thus, the measured electrical capacity of the probe provides information on the mass of liquid in the tank. With a suitable electronic apparatus, the mass of the residual propellant in the tank can be measured continuously. The outer tube of the capacity probe may be perforated or not, as shown in the preceding figure. A non-perforated probe was chosen for the Centaur launch vehicle, because it provided a better measurement [11].. "
What is the normal mixture ratio for the propellant management system in the J-2 engine?,"A propellant management system using electrical capacity probes was also chosen for the J-2 engine in the S-IVB stage, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [12].

"
How do the electrical capacity probes contribute to monitoring propellant mass in the S-IVB stage's management system?,"Valve Position Signal In the S-IVB stage, the propellant management system, in conjunction with the switch selector, controls the mass propellant loading ratio and the engine mixture ratio (liquid oxygen to liquid hydrogen) to ensure balanced consumption of propellant. The electrical capacity probes, located in the two tanks, monitor the mass of the propellants. During flight, the electrical capacity probes are not used to control the propellant mixture ratio. "
What is the engine mixture ratio set to before the engine start in a controlled operation?,"The mixture ratio is controlled by switch selector outputs, which are used to operate the propellant utilisation (PU) valve. The PU valve is a rotary valve which controls the quantity of liquid oxygen flowing to the engine. The PU valve is commanded to its null position to obtain an engine mixture ratio (EMR) of 5.0:1 prior to engine start. The PU valve remains at the 5.0:1 position during the first burn. "
What does the switch selector command the PU valve to for a delay in the S-IVB restart?,"Prior to engine restart (first opportunity), the PU valve is commanded by the switch selector to an EMR of 4.5:1 and remain at this position until approximately  2 min of S-IVB burn. Then the PU valve is commanded to its null position (5.0:1) by the switch selector. However, if the S-IVB restart is delayed to the second opportunity, the EMR is shifted from 4.5:1 to 5.0:1 by the switch selector at about the time in which the engine reaches 90% thrust [12].. "
What potential issue can arise with liquid level readings in low-gravity conditions when using an electrical capacity probe?,"An electrical capacity probe depends on the liquid being settled, and therefore can only be used for gauging during periods of thrusting [10]. In principle, an electrical capacity probe might be used in low-gravity conditions if the liquid configuration is controlled by propellant management devices. However, in such conditions, capillary forces in the annular gap between the walls of the probe would cause the liquid meniscus location to differ from the liquid level in the tank, and thus cause an inaccurate reading, which may be small and could be compensated for. "
How can non-linear sloshing affect the liquid measurement in a gauge during a landing scenario?,"Depending on the design, the probe can also be sensitive to liquid motions such as occurred with the first landing of the Lunar Module on the Moon, for which non-linear sloshing lowered the effective level of the liquid within the gauge to the point that a premature low liquid level warning was given [10].. "
What method is used to estimate remaining propellant in a tank when no specific measurement system is available?,"In the absence of a specific measurement system, the quantity of propellant remaining in a tank can be estimated by determining the consumption of the propel- lants which have already been used in comparison with the quantity initially loaded in the tanks. This method is commonly called bookkeeping. Some sensors and devices are used in the bookkeeping method, either separately or in conjunction. They are: e flow-meters or Venturi-meters in the lines between the tanks and the main. "
What devices are utilized to assess propellant flow rates by evaluating pressure in conjunction with pump performance?,"combustion chamber or the gas generator to measure the flow rates of thee sensors which determine the flow rates of the propellants by measuring their pressures in the pumps in conjunction with the performance curves of the pumps; and© calibrations of engine thrust versus propellant flow rate and tank pressure. Various types of flow-meters, turbine-meters, accelerometers, and pressure"
What limitations does the bookkeeping approach have regarding the detection of leaks and accuracy during specific engine operational phases?,"sensors are required for the bookkeeping method. This method can only be used during periods of engine thrusting, and its accuracy is limited by the accumula- tion over time of the errors committed in estimating the propellant consumption, in particular near the point of propellant depletion. In addition, the bookkeeping method cannot detect leaks."
What parameters are crucial for calculating a vehicle's mass during propulsion evaluations?,"Other methods indicated by Dodge [10] to evaluate propellant consumption are: e measuring the acceleration of the vehicle and the thrust of the engine, in order todetermine the mass of the vehicle at any given time in comparison with the mass"
What methods can be employed to manage the angle of the thrust vector in a rocket system during operation?,"© measuring the decay of pressure in the ullage spaces, in case of tanks which are initially pressurised, as the liquids are drained from their tanks and the ullage spaces increase.  5.6 Control of Thrust Direction Several methods used to control the direction of the thrust vector in a rocket vehicle have been discussed in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.2, as far as they can affect the design of the thrust chamber of a rocket engine. "
What is the primary method for controlling thrust direction in liquid-propellant rocket engines utilizing a specific mechanical mechanism?,"The present section is meant to describe in further depth the method of controlling the thrust vector by using a gimbal mechanism acting on either the nozzle or the engine assembly. This method is the most used in liquid- propellant rocket engines, due to its reliability and performance.

The four outboard engines (No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the figure) are gimbal-mounted to provide thrust vector control during powered flight. Attitude control of the S- II stage is maintained by gimballing the four outboard engines in conjunction with electrical control signals from the inertial unit flight control computer. "
What are the primary components of each hydraulic control subsystem associated with the engine gimballing system?,"The gimballing system consists of four independent closed-loop hydraulic control subsystems, which provide power for engine gimballing. The primary components of each control subsystem, also shown in the preceding figure, are an auxiliary pump, a main pump, an accumulator/reservoir manifold  assembly, and two servo-actuators. The auxiliary pump is electrically driven from the ground support equipment to provide hydraulic fluid circulation prior to launch. "
What component transforms electrical signals and hydraulic power into mechanical outputs for engine gimbal movement?,"The main pump is mounted to and driven by the engine liquid-oxygen turbo-pump. The accumulator/reservoir manifold assembly consists of a high-pressure accumu- lator, which receives high-pressure fluid from the pump, and a low-pressure reservoir, which receives return fluid from the servo-actuators. The servo-actuator is a power control unit, which converts electrical signals and hydraulic power into mechanical outputs which gimbal the engine. "

"
What mechanism is activated to release high-pressure fluid to the servo-actuators after the first stage separates from the second?,"During the pre-launch period, the auxiliary pump circulates the hydraulic fluid to preclude fluid freezing during propellant loading. Circulation is not required during the first stage (S-IC) burn, due to the short duration of the burn. After separation of the second stage (S-II) from the first, a S-II switch selector command unlocks the accumulator lock-up valves, releasing high-pressure fluid to each of the servo- actuators. "
What role do accumulators play during the initial phase before the activation of the primary hydraulic pump?,"The accumulators provide gimballing power prior to the main hydraulic pump operation, in the transient of separation of the two stages. During the S-II main-stage operation, the main hydraulic pump supplies high-pressure fluid to each of the servo-actuators. The return fluid from the actuators is routed to the reservoir, which stores hydraulic fluid at sufficient pressure to supply a positive pressure at the main pump inlet [11].. "
"What type of joint is used to mount the engine in the discussed system, and how does it facilitate movement?","As has been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.2, a gimballed engine is mounted on a spherical joint. In the three main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, the gimbal bearing is bolted to the vehicle by its upper flange and to the engine by its lower flange. It supports 33,271 N of engine weight and 2,224,000 N of thrust. It is a ball-and-socket  universal joint where concave and convex spherical surfaces are interconnected. "
What type of material is used for the bearing's construction in the specified application?,"Sliding contact occurs between these surfaces as the bearing is angulated. Fabroid® inserts located at the sliding contact surfaces reduce friction which occurs during gimbal bearing angulation. The bearing, which is installed during engine assembly, measures approximately 27.9 cm x 36.6 cm, weighs about 467 N, has an angular capability of +0.218 rad (+12.5 deg) and is made of a titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-6 V- 2Sn).

What is an example of a control system design specific to a rocket engine that utilizes gimbals for stabilization?,"A detailed example of design of a control system for a rocket engine mounted on gimbals can be found, for example, in [14]."
What are the main components used for measuring and regulating fluid motion in liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"5.7 Principal Components of Flow Control Systems Liquid-propellant rocket engines have several components which measure and control the motion of fluids through them. The principal components used for this purpose are valves, pressure regulators, and flow-meters. They are described here and in the following sections."
What are the three characteristics of a liquid considered when analyzing flow control devices in ideal fluid motion?,"A simple analysis of flow control devices can be done by considering firstly the motion of an ideal fluid, and then the corrections which are necessary to take account of the behaviour of real fluids. For example, a liquid can be considered inviscid, incompressible, and moving in laminar flow (see below) through a tube. The Bernoulli principle, so called after the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli, applies to this case. "
"What principle states that the sum of potential energy, pressure energy, and kinetic energy of a fluid in steady flow remains constant between two points in a tube?","According to this principle, the total energy (potential energy plus pressure energy plus kinetic energy) possessed by an ideal fluid in steady motion between any two cross sections | and 2 of a tube is constant.. "
How can the Bernoulli principle be represented when considering the total energy relative to weight?,"By considering the total energy per unit weight, the Bernoulli principle can be expressed as follows"

What is the purpose of a flow-meter using a specific fluid dynamic device in measuring the volume flow rate of a liquid?,"The preceding equations can be used to measure the volume flow rate g (m?/s) of a fluid through a fluid control system, as will be shown below.The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [15], shows a longitudinal section of a flow-meter based on the Venturi tube."
What device is used to measure the volume flow rate of liquid in a pipeline?,"A Venturi-meter, so called after the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Venturi, is a device which measures the volume flow rate of a liquid moving in a pipe."
"What are the three main structural components of the device that includes a convergent cone, a throat, and a diffuser?","It has three main parts, which are e a convergent cone, whose diameter decreases from the value Dj, of the pipe tothe value D, of the throat; ¢ a cylindrical throat, whose diameter D, is usually one-fourth to one-half of thevalue Din; and e a diffuser, whose diameter increases downstream of the throat and reaches again the value Dj, at the outlet plane."
What principle underlies the functioning of a Venturi-meter as fluid moves from the inlet to the throat?,"The included angle of the convergent cone is approximately 0.3665 rad (21°), and the included angle of the diffuser cone ranges from 0.1222 rad (7°) to 0.2618 rad (15°). Two pressure taps are placed one at the inlet of the convergent cone and the other at the throat. A Venturi-meter is based on the Bernoulli principle. When the cross-sectional area of the tube decreases from the inlet plane to the throat, then the pressure head p/(pgo) of the fluid is forced to decrease, and its velocity head v?/(2go) is forced to increase, in order for its total head to be constant. "
How can the volume flow rate be expressed in relation to the change in static pressure measured between two points?,"The decrease in static pressure is measurable at the two taps (usually, by reading the difference of head in open vertical tubes inserted through the wall of the tube under pressure), and the volume flow rate g can be expressed as a function of the decrease in static pressure p; — p2, as will be shown below. The velocity head acquired by the fluid  in the convergent part is then converted back into pressure head (minus a loss due to friction) in the diffuser going from the throat to the outlet plane. "
What is the formula for volume flow rate in ideal conditions using pressure difference and area ratios?,"The Bernoulli equation, written for z; = Zo, is ey eee Pi p2= 5 P(""2 vi) This equation, solved for v7, yields 2(p1 — v _ v _ (pi — p2) p By substituting this value of vy into v2 = (A;/A2)y1, there results Ye 2(p1 — p2) 1 _ 2goAHp i a ce in nw? p Ap A t-(#) 1 () Therefore, the volume flow rate g (m/s) in ideal conditions results from 1 1 2 2 2@1=p2) oD 2g0AH, q = Anvn = Ax —_—, = A; et Ay Al. "
What does the variable AH represent in the context of pressure measurement in two vertical tubes of a specific device?,"where AH, (m) is the difference of pressure head measured between the inlet plane and the throat in the two open vertical tubes inserted through the wall of the Venturi- meter."
What is the role of the discharge coefficient in relation to the volume flow rate in a measurement device?,"In practice, some loss of total head occurs in a Venturi-meter due to friction, and therefore the actual value of the volume flow rate q is slightly lower than the theoret- ical value resulting from the preceding equation. This loss can be taken into account by means of a discharge coefficient Cz, whose value is determined experimentally and is always less than unity, as follows"
What variable represents the product of two coefficients in the given mathematical expression?,"1 1 2 2 2(pi=p2) aD 2g0AH, q=CaAr ——_, = CyA et Ay Al"
How do you calculate the mass flow rate of a fluid given its volume flow rate and density?,"When the volume flow rate q (m/s) of a given fluid has been determined by means of a Venturi-meter, as has been shown above, then the mass flow rate m (kg/s) of the same fluid results by multiplying the volume flow rate q by the density p (kg/m?) of the fluid at the temperature of interest.  As an example of application of the concepts exposed above, it is required to calculate the mass flow rate of liquid oxygen flowing through an horizontal Venturi- meter which has the following properties: diameter at the inlet plane D;, = 0.1524 m, diameter at the throat plane D, = 0.0762 m, and discharge coefficient Cg = 0.92. "
"Calculate the mass flow rate given the volume flow rate of 0.07144 m³/s and the density of the liquid at its boiling point, which is 1141 kg/m³.","The difference of pressure head measured between the inlet and the throat is AH, = 13.86 m, and the density of liquid oxygen at its boiling point is p = 1141 kg/m? [16]. By substituting these data in the preceding equation, the volume flow rate results 1 3.1416 x 0.0762? 2 x 9.807 x 13.86 |* g = 0.92 x DO MONO 5g | EEE | = 0.07144 m3/s 4 1- (gozey* 0.1524 and the mass flow rate results m = pq = 1141 x 0.07144 = 81.52 kg/s. "
"What term describes fluids whose rate of deformation corresponds to the applied shear stress, named after a famous physicist?","All real fluids are viscous in various degrees. As has been shown in Chap. 4, Sect. 4.7, viscosity is a physical property which measures the degree of internal resistance opposed by a fluid to motion. The fluids for which the rate of deformation is proportional to the shear stress applied to them are called Newtonian fluids, after Isaac Newton. In case of a one-dimensional motion of a Newtonian fluid along a direction x (planar Couette flow), this linear relationship can be expressed as follows. "
"What is the relationship between shear stress, shear strain rate, and dynamic viscosity in a fluid flow scenario?","dv Try = KD where Ty (N/m?) is the shear stress, dvidy (s~!) is the rate of shear strain, that is, the velocity gradient in the direction y perpendicular to the direction x of motion, v = v(y) (m/s) is the velocity of motion in the direction x, and (Ns/m?) is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity of the fluid."
What are the three types of fluid motion that can occur within a cylindrical tube?,"The motion of a viscous fluid in a cylindrical tube may be either laminar or turbulent or transitional. The first two types of flow are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [17]."
What term describes the thin layers in which a viscous fluid flows smoothly in a laminar regime?,"A SA AL ET TSE = — i oS wail | ~ voll — = = oe mz, ~~ Te Ee EK SSA viscous fluid in laminar flow regime (left) moves smoothly in thin layers, called"
What occurs to the velocity of fluid layers as they move from the walls towards the center of a confined tube?,"laminae, which do not mix together. The layers in contact with the walls of the tube  are stationary, whereas the internal layers move by sliding one over another. The velocity of the layers increases from the walls to the central line of the tube with a parabolic profile."
What type of flow regime is characterized by irregular movement and mixing through eddies in a viscous fluid?,"By contrast, a viscous fluid in turbulent flow regime (right) moves irregularly with eddies and swirls which mix the layers of fluid together. The mean velocity profile for turbulent flow is approximately elliptic (blunt nose) and is characterised by a much higher shear stress, due to the slope of the velocity profile at the walls [17]. Even in conditions of turbulent flow, a thin layer (called boundary layer) exist near each wall of the tube where the fluid moves in laminar flow regime.. "
What numerical value helps determine if fluid motion is laminar or turbulent?,"A transitional flow fluctuates between laminar flow and turbulent flow. When this happens, a laminar flow is on the verge of becoming turbulent.A criterion to indicate whether the motion of a fluid occurs in laminar or turbulent flow is provided by the value of the Reynolds number. As has been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.5, the Reynolds number Re is defined as follows"
What does the Reynolds number represent in fluid dynamics concerning inertial and viscous forces?,"where p (kg/m?) is the density of the fluid at the given temperature, v (m/s) is the mean velocity of the fluid in the tube, d (m) is the hydraulic diameter of the tube, and yz (N s m~”) is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity of the fluid at the given temperature. The Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces which act on a unit volume of fluid moving in a tube. For low values of the Reynolds number, the viscous forces are sufficiently high to keep the fluid particles in parallel layers, and consequently the flow is laminar. "
What is the transition range of Reynolds number where flow becomes unstable due to incipient turbulence in a circular tube?,"For high values of the Reynolds number, the inertial forces prevail over the viscous forces, and consequently the flow is turbulent. For practical purposes, when the value of the Reynolds number is less than 2000, then the flow is laminar. The transition value for a fluid moving in a tube of circular cross section is Re = 2300. When the value of the Reynolds number ranges from about 2300 and 4000, then the flow is unstable, due to an incipient turbulence. When the value of Re is greater than 4000, then the flow is turbulent.. "
"What results from the friction forces acting on fluid particles in a tube, and how does it affect the kinetic energy of the fluid?","The friction forces acting on the particles of a fluid moving in a tube are due to the rubbing of the particles one against another and also against the walls of the tube. As a result of these forces, part of the kinetic energy possessed by the fluid is converted into heat. This heat may either remain into the fluid or be transferred to the external environment through the walls."
Explain how the Darcy-Weisbach equation relates pressure head drop to friction factor in a tube of specific length and hydraulic diameter.,"As has also been shown in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.5, the drop of pressure head AH, (m) due to friction in a tube of length L (m) and hydraulic diameter d (m) is expressed as a function of the Darcy friction factor fp (dimensionless) of the tube by means of the Darcy-Weisbach equation, as follows"
What does the Darcy friction factor depend on in addition to the Reynolds number?,"L( v? AH), = fo “()  where v (m/s) is the average velocity of the fluid, and gp = 9.80665 m/s? is the accel- eration of gravity near the surface of the Earth. The Darcy friction factor fp depends on the Reynolds number Re defined above and also on the shape and smoothness of the tube. This factor can be determined as a function of the Reynolds number Re and of the relative roughness ¢/d of the tube not only by means of the Colebrook-White relation (see Chap. "

"
What term is used to account for losses in a pipe and is added to its actual length in fluid dynamics calculations?,"These losses can be taken into account by means of a fictitious term L, (m), called equivalent length, which adds to the actual length L (m) of the pipe. By so doing, the Darcy-Weisbach equation written above becomes 2 AH, = fol *)(-). "
How is the total length determined when combining the actual length of a tube with the equivalent lengths of fittings?,"In other words, the actual length L of a tube and its equivalent length L., which takes account of all the fittings placed along the tube, are summed up to form a total length L + L., which in turn is introduced in the Darcy-Weisbach equation instead of the actual length L. The equivalent lengths L, for a range of sizes of a given type of fitting have been found experimentally to be in an approximately constant ratio to the diameters d of the fittings. "
What is the significance of the L./d ratio in relation to different sizes of fittings?,"In other words, L./d ~ constant. Therefore, a single value is sufficient to cover all sizes of each fitting. A table, which can be found in [19], gives the values of the L./d ratio for many valves and other typical fittings.. "
What equation can be used to calculate the total pressure drop considering the resistance coefficient for fittings in a fluid flow system?,"Another method, called K-method, takes account of the pressure drop due to the fittings by means of a resistance coefficient k assigned to each type of fitting. When this method is used, the total drop of pressure head can be computed by using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, as follows"
What are the names of the methods that refine the K method for coefficient calculations?,"Values of the coefficient k for several fittings can be found in [20]. Other methods are those called the 2-K (Hooper) method and the 3-K (Darby) method. They are refinements of the K method described above.

What are the primary functions of static and dynamic seals in preventing leakage in valve systems?,5.8 Static and Dynamic Seals for Leakage Control in Valves
What are the two types of seals mentioned for preventing fluid leakage in valves with relative motion?,"The dynamic seals considered here are mechanical devices used to prevent or reduce to an acceptable level the leakage of a fluid from one region of a valve in which flow occurs to another, when the surfaces to be protected from leakage are in relative motion. Static seals (such as O-ring seals and gaskets) for stationary surfaces are also considered here. The dynamic seals used for turbo-pumps of rocket engines have been described in Chap. 4, Sect. 4.13.. "
"What are the two types of leakage associated with valves, and how do they differ in terms of direction?","The leakage from a valve may be either internal leakage, which occurs in the direc- tion of the flow, or external leakage, which occurs from a valve to the external environ- ment, in a direction which differs from the normal direction of the flow. According to Howell and Weathers [25], the factors affecting the leakage requirements for valves are: ¢ loss of pressure or loss of propellant, to be prevented or kept below an acceptable. "
What are the potential consequences of fluid leakage in a system regarding personnel safety and infrastructure integrity?,"value in order to avoid system failure due to premature depletion of fluid;e damage to the system, such as corrosion or fire, which might occur as a result of leakage of propellants;e damage to personnel, which may occur in case of leakage of fluids which are toxic for inhalation or exposure; and"
What factors can impact experimental results when working with gases under pressure or propellants surrounding a spacecraft during atmospheric sampling missions?,"e interference with experiments, which might occur in case of gases under pressure or propellants enveloping a spacecraft whose mission is to sample the atmosphere of a planet."
"What types of seals are used for valves functioning under extreme temperature conditions, both high and cryogenic?",e seals for valves operating at high pressures and temperatures; and e seals for valves operating at cryogenic temperatures.
What are the operational pressure limits for valves used in rocket engines?,"Burmeister et al. [26] have made a survey on the matter. A brief account of this survey is given below. Valves for rocket engines operate at pressures ranging from zero to 6.895 x 108 N/m’, and at temperatures ranging from cryogenic values to over 1366 K. They can be classified into three principal categories, which are e plug valves;"
What types of valves can operate effectively under high pressure and temperature conditions?,"e gate valves; and e globe valves.  All of these valves can be used at high pressures and temperatures. Valves of other types, such as butterfly or vane valves, fall into one of these categories or into some combination of them. A tapered plug valve is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]. CI) Uy AW IMM"
What type of valve utilizes a tapered or cylindrical component to control fluid flow by rotation?,"A plug valve has a tapered or cylindrical plug with a hole drilled in the middle. When this plug is rotated, the position of the hole opens, or restricts, or closes the passage of a fluid through the valve. A plug valve can be operated in an intermediate position, in order to throttle the flow. Simple quarter-turn valves, such as the one shown in the preceding figure, are limited in high-pressure application by the rapid increase in operating torque with increasing difference of pressure. "
What occurs in the valve body when a fluid is allowed to enter either the larger or smaller end of a tapered component?,"When the fluid has access to either the large end or the small end of a tapered plug, then a force unbalance arises into or out of the valve body.. "
What factors influence the operating torque of a valve and how does lubricant film thickness affect leakage?,"The operating torque depends on the plug taper. The purpose of a tapered plug valve is to shut off flow in a leak-tight manner. When the thickness of the lubricant film is not uniform, then leakage occurs. The lubricant may be washed away by the fluid when unseating the plug, or may also be extruded by the difference of pressure. The three functions fulfilled by the lubricant (lubrication, plug unseating, and viscous sealing) are combined in plug valves of the Nordstrom type, such as the valve shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]. "
What is the maximum temperature tolerance of the valve that is higher than a standard tapered plug valve?, igi = Eee Le A valve of this type can bear a higher pressure than the maximum pressure bear- able by an ordinary tapered plug valve. An increase in temperature degrades the properties of the lubricant-sealant. Maximum temperatures bearable by this type of valve are about 700 K or 800 K. The high viscosity of the lubricant-sealant at very low temperatures precludes application of grease at cryogenic temperatures. 
How does a gate valve control fluid flow in a pipe?,"A gate valve opens or closes the passage of fluid in a pipe by raising or lowering a flat plate across the pipe. This plate slides over sealing surfaces in a direction perpendicular to the fluid stream in the pipe, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]. 4. Nt \ CLL °7 YH Wy . "
What factors affect the galling tendency and strength of materials used in the sealing surfaces of a valve?,"The sealing surfaces of a gate valve must bear the stresses induced by moving the plate from the fully open to the fully closed position. Therefore, the galling properties of the materials used and their ability to withstand stresses are very important. As a general rule, the galling tendency increases and the strength decreases with increasing temperature. To provide good sealing surfaces, the gate and the seat must be flat. Therefore, a gate valve must be thick, especially in large valves subject to high pressures.. "
What method can be utilized to prevent leakage in gate and tapered plug valves?,"Gate valves and tapered plug valves can be protected from leakage by using viscous sealing. For this purpose, a sealant is injected into grooves located around the flow passage in the gate or in the seat, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26].tai lk emi 4 FT | i tt 1 == | be| = [lal — —S St Dp r 4 q a 'S | aan!"
What is the relationship between the injection pressure of the sealant and the fluid pressure in the pipe for gate valves using viscous sealants?,"In the valve shown in the preceding figure, the injection pressure of the sealant is proportional to the pressure of the fluid which moves in the pipe. Gate valves using viscous sealants have lower operating torques than conventional parallel slide gate valves. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26], shows a tapered gate valve, which makes it unnecessary to slide the gate across the entire sealing surface.  Yj “yy. "
What component on a tapered gate valve prevents sealing surfaces from sliding contact due to flow impingement and pressure differences?,"The seat and the gate are not in mutual contact when the gate has been lifted by part of its total travel. Side ribs on a tapered gate valve resist the action exerted by the flow impingement and by the difference of pressure, which tends to move the gate toward the downstream seat, and keep the sealing surfaces from sliding contact."
What issue arises when a tapered gate valve cools down after being closed at elevated temperatures?,"When a tapered gate valve is closed at a high temperature and then cools down, then the gate tends to bind, because the gate and the body parts have different coefficients of thermal expansion. This can be avoided by using flexible tapered gates for valves operating at high temperatures."
What type of sealant allows gate valves to withstand pressures up to 1.034 x 10^8 N/m²?,"Gate valves not using viscous sealants are subject to leakage, and therefore are not used in case of high pressures. Gate valves using viscous sealants can bear gas and petroleum pressures as high as 1.034 x 108 N/m?. Gate valves sealed by inserts made of elastomers or fluorocarbons are used when contamination of the fluid is to be avoided. However, the pressure which these valves can bear is limited by plastic flow of these inserts.. "
What shape is the moving component of a globe valve that fits into a stationary ring seat to control fluid flow?,"Globe valves are those used in water taps to start or stop or regulate the flow in a pipe. They have a moving member which is pushed into the flow passage, as a cork is pushed into the neck of a bottle, and a stationary member, which is a ring seat. The moving member is shaped as a cone frustum, which fits into the mating body seat, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]. "
How does the angle of a cone frustum compare to that of a tapered plug valve's plug?,The included angle of this cone frustum is much greater than that of a plug used in a tapered plug valve.  ) E NY SEALS REQUIRED N \ Ss Lt G UY on 7. 
What shape of seat is known for resisting distortions due to fluid pressure in high-pressure applications?,"A seat shaped as a cone frustum is very resistant to distortions of the valve body due to the pressure exerted by the fluid. In addition, should such distortions occur, the elastic deformation in the seat tends to maintain satisfactory sealing contact. Globe valves lend themselves to be used in cases of high pressures and temperatures. Of course, the materials used in such cases must be carefully selected. "
"What are two materials used for sealing surfaces in valves, known for their ability to withstand high pressure and temperature?","The sealing surfaces of these valves are made of cobalt-chromium alloys, such as the Stellites®, or of other materials such as carbides and ceramics. However, these materials have low resistance to impact. Globe valves are widely used for high-pressure and high- temperature applications. Commercial valves of this type are available for pressures up to 1.034 x 108 N/m? at atmospheric temperatures, and also for pressures of 0.3447 x 108 N/m? at a temperature of 922 K [26].. "
Why are two seals essential in a valve for proper operation and fluid containment?,"Since the inner parts of a valve must be contained into the body of the valve, which also contains the fluid under pressure, then it is necessary to provide some means of closure or cover. In addition, an operating mechanism for flow control must be contained into the valve body. Therefore, at least two seals are necessary to a valve. These seals are illustrated in the preceding figure, with reference to a globe valve. However, they are also necessary with valves of other types.. "
What are the factors that determine the maximum pressure levels and costs associated with different methods of achieving cover sealing?,"Cover sealing can be obtained in several ways, each of which has its maximum level of pressure and its cost."
What are the two types of gaskets that are more appropriate for high-pressure or high-temperature applications compared to flat gaskets?,"A flat gasket for cover sealing, shown on the left-hand side of the following figure, is not suited to either high-pressure or high-temperature applications, because it requires large surfaces. Other types of gaskets which are better suited to these applications are the spiral-wound gaskets and the lens ring gasket. A spiral-wound gasket is shown (right), in comparison with a flat gasket (left), in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26].  \ pom \ perctoen | a ta om») \ pte aa ae vam > \ Sa AM. (0) (SST. "
What materials are commonly used in the construction of a spiral-wound gasket?,"A spiral-wound gasket is made of a V-shaped metallic strip or ribbon mixed with a non-metallic filler material. The metal (usually stainless steel) is wound outwards ina circular spiral, and the filler material (usually graphite or poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene, whose commercial name is Teflon®) is wound in the same manner, but starting on the opposite side. This results in alternating layers of filler and metal. "
What materials are employed in the construction of gaskets to ensure sealing and provide structural integrity under high temperatures?,"The filler is the sealing element, and the metal provides structural strength to the gasket. For temperatures above 811 K, ceramic fibre fillers have been used [25]. An inner ring and an outer ring made of steel are used on the gasket for centring and controlling compression.. "
What is the primary function of a gasket in engineering applications?,"A lens ring gasket is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26].4 Gi = ween ene Y==YV7Y 7 Vd == ag ee . A ee % {FF YS fy 5 = Yi ULLs SS ZG YY Yjyyyy a fy SY Yf"
What is the purpose of a deformable metallic ring in a flange assembly under compressive loads?,"A lens ring gasket is made of a sealing metal of lenticular shape which fits into the recesses or grooves of a flange. Since the metallic ring is designed to be softer than the flange grooves, then the gasket deforms plastically under compressive loads instead of the flange. This deformation spreads the gasket faces, and therefore protects the gasket from overstresses. "
"What type of gasket is appropriate for extremely high internal pressures, specifically those at or exceeding 6.895 x 10^8 N/m²?","Ina spiral-wound gasket and in a lens ring gasket, the sealing stress is proportional to the internal pressure. Lens ring gaskets are suitable for pressures of 6.895 x 108 N/m? and above [26]."
"What type of seal has its sealing stress directly related to the pressure within the system, and can be designed for both radial and lateral containment?","The O-ring is another type of static or dynamic seal, in which the sealing stress is proportional to the internal pressure. An O-ring is placed in a groove which is designed to provide a radial or lateral containment, depending upon the specific application. As pressure increases, an O-ring deforms as shown on the left-hand side of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]. The same figure also shows, on the right-hand side, a metallic O-ring having holes to admit the fluid under pressure into the ring, in order to make the sealing stress proportional to the pressure exerted by the fluid contained in the valve.. "
What materials can be used to coat metallic O-rings for enhanced sealing performance?,"1 noo ||| Zoesamne sem eile ma ))||| Mae | Yh | DYNAMIC SEAL \pnessureMetallic O-rings may also be coated with elastomers or fluorocarbons to provide better sealing. They are suitable for high pressures, but are also easily damaged, and therefore must be installed in specially designed split grooves [26]."
"What are the two additional categories of seals mentioned, and where is each type positioned in relation to a referenced figure?","Two further types of seals are the pressure sealing ring and the lapped seal, which are shown on respectively the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]."

What components comprise a sealing ring designed to create sealing stresses through member displacement in response to internal fluid pressure?,"A pressure sealing ring (left) consists of a segmented retaining ring, a spacer ring, and a gasket. A pressure sealing ring uses the displacement of one of its members to develop the sealing stresses. The gasket is initially wedged against the surface of the body by means of bolts. When the internal pressure exerted by the fluid in the body increases, then the gasket is wedged more and more tightly against its constraints. "
What characteristic of a lapped seal enhances its sealing capability?,"A lapped seal (right) has a very smooth mating surface whose sealing capability is  reinforced by lapping. This type of seal is suited to either radial or axial installation, as shown in the preceding figure.. "
What two methods are mentioned for sealing body-cover joints?,"Body-cover joints can also be sealed by using a fillet-weld seal or a canopy seal, which are shown on respectively the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26].| \\| | lj | - | 1 | \) } YU rt GZ ?

What type of weld is applied at the interface of two mating components to create a seal while allowing for slight movement?,A fillet-weld seal (left) is performed by depositing a fillet weld bead at the interface of the mating parts. A canopy seal (right) is similar to a fillet-weld seal and is used where a slight movement of the mating parts is expected.
What are the design considerations for seals used in valves operating at extremely low temperatures?,"Other types of seals for valves used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications are described in [25, 26].Valves operating at cryogenic temperatures and seals used for them also require a careful design. As has been shown in Chap. 1, Sect. 1.4, by cryogenic fluids we mean gases which can be liquefied at or below 122 K [27]."
What phenomenon occurs when liquid helium is cooled to temperatures at or below 2.17 K?,"Permanent gases, such as methane, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium, change from gas to liquid at atmospheric pressure at the temperatures shown in the following table (due to the courtesy of NIST [28]), called the normal boiling point (NBP). Such liquids are known as cryogenic liquids or cryogens. Liquid helium, when cooled further to 2.17 K or below, becomes a superfluid with very unusual properties associated with being in the quantum mechanical ground state.. "
What factors must be considered in valve design for minimizing heat transfer at very low temperatures?,"Cryogen Temperature (K) Methane 111.7 Oxygen 90.2 Nitrogen TIA Hydrogen 20.3 Helium 42According to Howell and Weathers [25], in the design of valves operating atcryogenic temperatures, the following requirements are to be taken into account: e reduction of heat transfer from the external environment to the valve, in order to prevent excessive losses of cryogenic fluid by evaporation; and"
How can heat transfer be minimized between components of valves used in extremely low-temperature fluids?,e reduction of heat transfer between temperature-sensitive parts of valves in cryogenic fluids.
What types of non-metallic materials are commonly used as thermal barriers in cryogenic valve applications?,"A method often used to thermally insulate temperature-sensitive parts of valves (for example, actuators) from the valve body which contains the cryogenic fluid consists in placing a thermal barrier made of a non-metallic material having a low thermal conductivity (for example, Teflon®) between the valve body and the part to be insulated. Ductile metals of low conductivity which are often used for cryogenic valves are austenitic stainless steels (usually the lower-carbon 304, also known as 18/8, and the ever lower-carbon 304L), aluminium alloys, copper, ASTM B-61 and B- 62 bronzes, and nickel [26]. In addition to using materials of low thermal conductivity, other methods are also used for the same purpose. These methods are:. "
What method is used to interrupt heat conduction between components operating at varied temperatures while enclosing them in a vacuum?,"e breaking completely the path of heat conduction, by separating the parts which operate at different temperatures by an insulating space (for example, in a broken stem valve, the valve actuator is thermally insulated from the valve body by means of radial bars on the upper stem which drive against axial pins on the lower stem) and enclosing the entire valve in an evacuated chamber;"
What method can be employed to enhance thermal conduction by utilizing additional components while minimizing exposure of certain seals to cold substances?,"e increasing the path of heat conduction, by using extended stems and bonnets including long gaseous columns, in order to keep the stem seal packings exposed only to insulating vapour, and not to the cold liquid;"
What types of materials are utilized for insulation around valve bodies in terms of composition and structure?,"¢ providing bonnets with integral black-coated fins, to direct heat away through radiation from the packing to the external environment;e using plastiform insulating foams, made of polystyrene, polyurethane, rubber, silica, and glass, around the valve body; and¢ using low-density materials, such as powders and fibres, with gas at atmospheric pressure in the interstitial spaces."
What structural design feature aids in minimizing the mass required for cooling in a valve designed for low-temperature fluids?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26], shows a vacuum-jacketed valve used for cryogenic fluids, where the inner wall surrounds the primary pressure vessel, and the outer wall is of light construction to reduce to cool-down mass."
What type of surface finishing can help minimize the transfer of heat through radiation?,y Ce. Eo <FY- ae ee Brightly finished interior surfaces may be used to reduce radiative heat transfer. 
What materials are typically used in thermal radiation shielding surrounding a valve containing liquid helium?,"In some cases, especially when the cryogenic fluid is liquid helium, a valve is surrounded with a vacuum-jacket, then another cryogenic fluid (usually liquid nitrogen) is circulated in the interstitial space between the two walls to act as a thermal radiation shield, and finally an insulating foam is placed as an outside covering [26]. It is possible to have insulating foam bonded to the surface of the insulation cavity. "
What materials are frequently utilized for valve seats in applications involving fluorine?,"This type of insulation, usually called “foamed in place” is quite adaptable to valves and other components having irregular surfaces [25]. Trim parts, such as plugs and stems, of valves for cryogenic fluids are often made of stainless steel or Monel®, which is a nickel-copper alloy. Teflon® and Kel-F®/Neoflon® are commonly used for seats. Valves for fluorine have often seats made of copper. Bushings made of Ampco® (aluminium bronze) have been successfully used with stems made of stain- less steel. "
What materials are commonly used for making gaskets in technical applications?,"Bushings are also made of Teflon® or glass-impregnated Teflon®. Packing is made of pure or filled Teflon® and Kel-F®/Neoflon®. Welded bellows are some- times used instead of packings. Gaskets are made of Teflon® or metal-clad Teflon®. Rings made of stainless steel are used in ring-type joint flanges. Fluorine requires soft copper, aluminium 25, or stainless steel for gaskets [26].. "
What feature in a cryogenic fluid valve minimizes heat transfer and strain by avoiding bolts or studs in its construction?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26], shows a cryogenic fluid valve whose vacuum-insulating jacket encloses the entire body. An expansion bellows for attachment to a piping jacket is provided to prevent the transmission of strains. Air is sealed in the stem cylinder to achieve long, poorly conductive path, and a vapour space is provided between the cylinder and the body extension. Heat transfer is also reduced by the absence of bolts or studs in the valve body [26].  CO F foo. "
What considerations must be taken into account when using principal seals for cryogenic fluids compared to high-pressure and high-temperature applications?,"Most of the principal seals considered above for high-pressure and high- temperature applications may also be used for cryogenic fluids. However, special care is necessary because of the different properties of the materials."
What types of materials are suitable for gaskets under high stress loading and high shear-stress loading conditions?,"The use of soft plastic gaskets is limited to reinforced or laminated Teflon®. Thin gaskets made of hard plastics, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), whose trade name is Mylar®, may be used in case of high stress loading. Soft metals, such as copper and aluminium, may be used in case of high shear-stress loading. The following figure, re-drawn from [25], shows two gasket gland designs used for cryogenic service. They are: (left) a rounded-edge seal ring, and (right) a knife-edge shear seal.. "

What precaution should be taken regarding the containment of a certain metal due to its tendency to flow at lower temperatures?,"When using indium, care must be taken to confine the gland because of the cold-flow tendency of this metal [25].  5.9 Design of Propellant Valves. "
"What type of valves are primarily utilized to start and stop propellant flow in rocket engines, and what is a feature of some valves for controlling flow rates?","The valves described in the present section are principally used to initiate and termi- nate the flow of propellants from the tanks to the main combustion chamber and to the gas generator of a rocket engine. Therefore, these valves are often of the open- closed, two-position, normally closed type. However, some valves are also required to control the flow rate of propellants by means of a restriction of variable area. "
What type of valves allows for continuous adjustment in operating position for controlling thrust-throttle and propellant mixture ratios?,"Valves of the latter type are used for thrust-throttle and propellant-mixture-ratio control, because they can continuously vary their operating position, in contrast to shut-off valves, which are either fully open or fully closed.. "
What are the essential criteria for valves used in propellant systems regarding their performance and operational integrity?,"Requirements for propellant valves are compatibility with propellants, structural strength, absence of leakage in closed position, proper actuation time when opening or closing, and minimum pressure loss."
Identify the various types of valves commonly utilized for propellant control mentioned in the relevant section.,"Apart from the general classification considered in Sect. 5.8, we describe here in particular the most used types of propellant valves, which are butterfly valves, ball valves, poppet valves, Venturi valves, gate valves, and needle valves."

What component of a butterfly valve is responsible for controlling fluid flow by rotating within the valve body?,"A butterfly valve is used to start, regulate, or stop the motion of a fluid in a duct. With reference to the preceding figure, the movable part of a butterfly valve is a flat element, called the disc, which may be rotated to control the flow through the valve body. The disc can rotate on a single-piece shaft or on a two-piece shaft, which  extends across the diameter of an orifice and supports the disc on both sides. "
What is the range of internal diameters for butterfly valves utilized in specific applications?,The internal diameter of existing butterfly valves ranges from 50 to 400 mm. These valves are used for propellants at absolute pressures ranging from 1.4 x 10° to 1 x 107 N/m? [3]. 
What design feature enhances the shaft's stiffness while allowing the disc to rotate independently of the main sealing component?,"For greater rigidity, the shaft may be integral with the disc. The centre of rotation of the disc is usually offset, as shown in the preceding figure, in order to allow the disc to rotate off the primary seal. For low leakage, a plastic lip seal (described in Chap. 4, Sect. 4.13) is usually employed in the valve housing."
What are the performance and cost considerations associated with spherical and conical shaped discs in valve applications?,"The discs of butterfly valves have spherical or conical shapes, as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [29]. A disc of spherical shape (left) has better performance, but is more expensive to fabricate. A disc of conical shape (right) is more subject to leakage because of greater wear [29]."

What materials are utilized for the construction of the shaft and pins in the described valve system?,"A butterfly valve is operated by an actuator of the piston type, through a connecting link and shaft crank arm. The actuating power is the pressure exerted by either a non- cryogenic liquid propellant or an inert gas, and is controlled by a pilot valve. The shaft and the pins are made of stainless steel, whereas most of the other parts are made of aluminium alloys. Butterfly valves oppose low resistance to the motion of propellants flowing through them.. "
What is the formula for calculating the characteristic area of a butterfly valve based on its dimensions?,"The characteristic area A, (m*) of a butterfly valve results from& A. = are — Ag where d; (m) is the inside diameter of the valve seat lip seal, and A, (m7) is the projected valve disc area at the fully open position. The values of A, range from 0.65 x (1d?/4) for a 50 mm diameter valve to about 0.87 x (xd?/4) for a 300 mm diameter valve [3]."
What is the relationship between the resistance coefficient and the angular position of the disc in a valve used to regulate flow?,"A butterfly valve maintains a smooth flow over a wide range of angular positions of the valve disc. The values of the resistance coefficient k as a function of the opening angle are given by the manufacturer of the valve or can be found, for example, in [30, 31]. "
What device is commonly attached to the drive shaft of a valve to provide continuous positional feedback?,"RP-1 is used sometimes as the actuating fluid for liquid-oxygen valves in rocket engines burning RP-1 with liquid oxygen. In this case, it is necessary to prevent RP-1 from freezing at the actuator by using a heater. A potentiometer is often attached to the drive shaft of a butterfly valve to indicate continuously the position of the valve disc."
What factors influence the torque necessary for rotation in a butterfly valve system?,"The torque required to rotate the shaft and the disc of a butterfly valve depends on the hydraulic torque 7, (Nm) and on the frictional torque Ty (Nm) acting on the valve. The frictional torque opposes always rotation. The hydraulic torque (in spite of the offset of the disc, which is always placed on the side opposite to the direction of the flow, as shown in the preceding figures) acts in the closing direction for most angular positions (from 77/20 to 47r/9 rad) of the disc.. "
How is the closing torque related to the opening torque in the operation of a specific type of valve?,"The opening torque T, (Nm) and the closing torque T,. (Nm) required to operate a butterfly valve can be expressed as followsT. = Ty — Th where the hydraulic torque T;, is supposed to act on the disc of the valve in the closing direction."
What factors influence the estimation of frictional torque in a disc related to pressure difference and projected area?,"The frictional torque Ty depends on the difference of pressure on the two faces of the disc and also on the projected area of the disc, which in turn depends on the angular position of the disc in the valve. The value of the frictional torque can be estimated as follows"
What variable represents the radius of the shaft at the bearing section in the equation relating to pressure difference and friction?,"Ty = ky rs fm dy Ap where ky is the friction factor coefficient whose value is determined experimentally, rs (m) is the radius of the shaft at the bearing section, f,,, is the coefficient of friction between the shaft and the bearing, d, (m) is the inside diameter of the valve seat lip seal, and Ap (N/m?) is the difference of pressure across the disc."
What method can be employed to estimate the value of hydraulic torque?,The value of the hydraulic torque can be estimated as follows
"What parameter is indicated by the symbol ""k"" in the equation related to hydraulic flow?","Ty = ky d? Ap where k,, is the hydraulic coefficient whose value is determined experimentally and depends on the angular position of the disc in the valve."
What is the range of torque values required for the actuator in a butterfly valve design?,"In the practical design of a butterfly valve, the actuator is required to provide a torque whose value ranges from two to three times the maximum estimated value necessary to open or close the valve. In addition, at the start of the opening stroke, the actuator must overcome the static friction forces due to all seals. The opening and closing times of butterfly valves range from 0.02 to 0.2 s [3]."
"Calculate the required torque to operate a valve given a shaft radius of 0.02032 m, a seat lip seal diameter of 0.1956 m, and a friction coefficient of 0.05.","As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to determine the torques necessary to open and close a butterfly valve having the following data: radius of the valve shaft at the bearing section r; = 0.02032 m, inside diameter of  the valve seat lip seal d, = 0.1956 m, coefficient of friction between the shaft and the bearing f,,, = 0.05. The data found experimentally are given below. "

What component in a ball valve rotates to change the valve's position from open to closed?,"A ball valve is substantially a sphere provided with a port and fitting into a cup- shaped housing, such that a rotation of this sphere through a right angle changes the position of the valve from open to closed. In other words, when the valve is turned to the open position, the ball rotates to a point in which the hole through the ball is aligned with the flow openings (inlet and outlet) of the valve body. "
What happens to the hole in the ball when the valve is moved to the closed position?,"When the valve is turned to the closed position, the ball rotates to a point in which the hole through the ball is perpendicular to the flow openings of the valve body, and therefore the flow is stopped. There are two common types of this valve. They are the fixed ball valve and the floating ball valve, which are shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25].  SPRING-LOADED SEM lev; SEAL me CI ai FLOW — FLOW FIXED BALL VALVE FLOATING BALL VALVE. "
What type of sealing mechanism is employed on the upstream side of the ball in a fixed ball valve?,"In a fixed ball valve (left), the ball is supported by fixed bearings, and the seal is spring-loaded against the ball. The seal is mounted on the upstream side of the ball, and is usually designed to act in one direction only. However, another spring-loaded seal may also be mounted on the downstream side of the ball, in order to obtain a bi-directional sealing."
What is the primary source of seating force in a floating ball valve?,"In a floating ball valve (right), the ball is supported by fixed seals, and the seating force is provided by the fluid under pressure, which pushes the ball against the seat. In a floating ball valve, the seals are placed both upstream and downstream of the ball, and therefore the valve may be used in either direction. The use of floating ball valves is confined to low-pressure applications."
"What are the common materials used for seals in ball valves, and what advantages do they offer?","The materials used for the body of a ball valve may be metals or plastics, such as Unplasticised Polyvinyl Chloride (UPVC). The ball may be made of metal or plastic. Metallic balls have highly polished, hard chrome surfaces. Seal materials may be plastics or elastomers. Teflon® is the most commonly used material for seals, due to its properties of high resistance to corrosion and low friction."
What is the primary benefit of using ball valves in terms of pressure attributes?,"The principal advantage of ball valves is a low pressure drop. They also have a very good leakage control, and can be designed to operate equally well with the flow in either direction. On the other hand, the actuating forces required by them are high, because these valves cannot be pressure-balanced [25]."
What component in the valve design aids in controlling fluid flow and involves an orifice situated between the oxidizer and fuel sides?,"An isometric cross section of a poppet valve, used for the AJ10-138 rocket engine, is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [32].

"
What type of valves operate with a movable part that moves perpendicularly to the seating surface in engine cylinders?,"Poppet valves are those used in cylinders of car engines. They are similar to globe valves (described in Sect. 5.8), because for both of them the movable part of the valve travels perpendicularly to a plane through the seating surface. According to Howell and Weathers [25], the term poppet valve is used synonymously with globe valve."
What factors determine the choice of sealing surface materials in a poppet valve design?,"The designer of a poppet valve chooses the types of sealing surfaces, either hard or soft, which are best suited for the poppet and for the seat. These surfaces are said to be hard or soft depending on the type of material used. A hard sealing surface is made of a material (metal, ceramic, or cermet, the last being a composite material made of ceramic and metallic materials) which does not permanently yield or deform except with wear. "
What type of materials are used to create a soft sealing surface in the mentioned configurations?,"By the way, flexible metallic discs are a special type of hard sealing surface. A soft sealing surface is made of plastic or elastomeric materials. Possible configurations for combinations of hard and soft sealing surfaces are indicated below. Poppet sealing surface Configuration designation. "
Identify the four types of sealing configurations presented in the figure that demonstrate hard-on-hard sealing principles.,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [29] shows four examples of hard-on-hard sealing configurations.  t Conical poppet ror ~ g J ‘Conical seat Spherical seat {a) Conical on conical, (b) Spherical on spherical, Flat poppet Spherical poppet ' Flat seat ‘Conical seat (c) Flat on flat, (d) Spherical on conical,"
What is the design called that incorporates a soft sealing surface as an insert of elastomer or plastic in the housing of a poppet valve?,A poppet valve in which the hard sealing surface meets a soft sealing surface may incorporate the soft sealing surface as an insert of elastomer or plastic in the housing. This type of design is known as a soft-seat poppet.
What are two configurations for a soft-seat poppet as displayed in the provided figure?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [29] shows typical configura- tions for a soft-seat poppet.  9% Yi] 4 Y), V; iB ‘SZ iy i S é ZAG Brew PS SH Ts CTY NY bc or TT RD harp-corner soft se y 4 soft seat \ Q|e ¢ t (a) Sphere seating on sharp corner of soft seat (b) Flat poppet seating on beveled soft seat It is also possible to incorporate the soft sealing surface either as an integral part of the poppet (for example, of a plastic poppet) or as an insert of elastomer or plastic in the poppet. "
What is the name given to a design featuring a soft sealing component in a valve?,"This type of design is known as a soft poppet. In either location, the soft sealing insert is designated as a seal. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [29] shows an elastomeric seal insert retained in a poppet by a shrink-fit mechanical retainer.

"
What components are essential for effective leakage control in systems employing short-stroke devices?,"This makes it possible to use actuators such as solenoids or diaphragms, which are short-stroke devices. A very good leakage control can be achieved by using hard or  soft seals, as has been shown above. When hard seals are used, great care must be taken to eliminate contamination from the fluid and from the duct upstream of the valves.. "
What method allows for the counterbalancing force on a poppet valve by using pressure acting on one poppet's top?,"A poppet valve can be pressure-balanced by using two poppets which are on the same stem and seat on separate seats. By so doing, the pressure acting on the top of one poppet provides the counterbalancing force acting on the bottom of the other poppet. The same result can also be obtained by providing the poppet stem with a pressure-balancing piston area, or by making the poppet stem diameter equal to the seating diameter. However, it is practically impossible to obtain complete pressure balance under both shut-off and flow conditions.. "
What advantages does a poppet valve offer over ball and butterfly valves in terms of movement and flow characteristics?,"A poppet valve is lighter than valves of other types for many applications, due to the small stroke of its actuator. For example, ball and butterfly valves require a rotation through a right angle for full stroke, and therefore need a larger associated mechanism. A poppet valve is used when the valve is desired to open rapidly from zero to full flow with a short travel of its movable element. Of all types of poppet valve, the in-line valve is the one which has the best flow properties. The body of a poppet valve may be either cast on one piece or split. In the latter case, the body halves are joined by bolts [25].. "
What is the structural design of a cavitating Venturi valve according to the evaluated cross section?,"A cross section of a cavitating Venturi valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25]. "
How does decreasing the minimum pressure of a liquid propellant below its vapor pressure at a tube's throat affect flow rate during cavitation?,"A cavitating Venturi valve is used to control the flow rate of a propellant in a rocket engine as a function of the pressure upstream of the valve and of the throat area. When the minimum pressure of a liquid propellant is made to decrease below its vapour pressure at the throat of a Venturi tube, then cavitation occurs and the propellant evaporates. In case of cavitation, the propellant flow rate is independent of the downstream pressure. "
What happens to the flow rate when downstream pressure decreases further in the presence of cavitation at a fluid propellant's throat?,"Cavitation occurs by decreasing the pressure of a liquid propellant at the throat of a Venturi tube to such an extent that nearly all of the upstream pressure head of the fluid is converted into velocity head. When this occurs, the only static pressure remaining in the fluid at the throat is equal to the vapour pressure of the fluid itself. In such conditions, when the upstream pressure of the fluid is kept constant, a further decrease in downstream pressure does not result in increased flow rate, because cavitation at the throat maintains the pressure equal to the vapour pressure of the fluid.. "
What is the maximum allowable downstream pressure as a percentage of the upstream pressure to prevent cavitation in a valve system?,"In other words, the flow rate through the valve remains constant for a given throat area and for a given upstream pressure, independently of the downstream pressure, provided that the downstream pressure does not increase above the level in which cavitation occurs. In practice, the downstream pressure must be less than 85% of the upstream pressure in order for cavitation to occur [25]."
What two pressure values are essential for the design of a flow control mechanism in rocket engines using a specific type of valve?,"Cavitating Venturi valves are used in rocket engines when it is desired to prevent variations of propellant flow rate caused by variable back pressure on the control valve. In the design of a cavitating Venturi valve used to control flow rates, it is necessary to know the total pressure pr (N/m?) and the vapour pressure p, (N/m?) of the propellant whose flow rate is to be controlled. The ratio"
What is the equation used to calculate the theoretical velocity of a propellant at the throat of a specific device?,"is the total pressure head available for conversion to velocity head in the Venturi tube. In the preceding equation, p (kg/m?) is the density of the propellant at the given temperature, and go = 9.80665 m/s? is the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the Earth. The total pressure head (pr — p,)/(pgo) is used to determine the theoretical value v, (m/s) of the propellant velocity at the throat of the Venturi tube, as follows. "
"What is the formula to calculate the actual volume flow rate of propellant, given a discharge coefficient of 0.93?","The actual volume flow rate g (m/s) of propellant through the Venturi tube can be determined by assuming a discharge coefficient of 0.93 [25]. Therefore, the actual volume flow rate is"
What is the optimal range of the diffuser cone angle for maximizing pressure recovery in a cavitating valve?,"2 3 q = 0.93A,v; = 0.934, pe) p where A, (m7) is the area of the throat of the Venturi tube.  It has been found experimentally [25] that the best pressure recovery through a cavitating Venturi valve is obtained when the included angle of the diffuser cone is in the range going from 7/36 rad (5°) to 2/30 rad (6°). Venturi valves have been used successfully in rocket engines for cryogenic and storable propellants [3].. "
"What type of valve is represented in the provided diagram, and what is its primary function in fluid control systems?","A cross section of a gate valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25]."
What mechanism is employed to enable different flow rates when operating certain valves?,Gate valves have been considered in Sect. 5.8 from the point of view of sealing and leakage control. Their use as propellant valves is discussed below. Gate valves have a flat plate which moves perpendicularly to the fluid stream in a duct in order to open or close the passage of the fluid through them. They may be operated by any of the usual actuators used for this purpose. Quick-return mechanisms have been used when it was desired to open or close such valves at different flow rates. 
What are the benefits of a valve that facilitates minimal resistance in an open position and effective sealing to reduce leakage when closed?,"When the plate is completely removed from the fluid stream, a gate valve opposes little or no resistance to the flow. Consequently, the principal advantage of a gate valve is unrestricted fluid stream, and therefore low pressure drop when the valve is in the wide open position. When a gate valve is in the closed position, the contact surface between the plate and the seal extends along the whole circumference of the tube cross section, and therefore this valve provides good sealing, which results in little or no leakage across the plate. "
"What are the primary applications for which gate valves are typically designed, based on their pressure and flow characteristics?"," A gate valve has a short distance between the sections of inlet and outlet in the direction of the flow. On the other hand, it has poor throttling properties and is also subject to erosion when they it is in the near closed position. Its response is slow, because of the large travel and the high actuation forces due to friction. Consequently, gate valves are normally used as on-off mechanisms. They have been designed for propellant line pressures up to 2 x 10’ N/m? [3] and for low propellant flow applica- tions (for example, for gas generator control and ground support services). "
What is the primary function of vent holes in certain types of valves when handling liquids?,"In ground support systems, they are used as shut-off or block valves in systems subject to moderate pressures. This is because they cannot be balanced. Gate valves have also been used for cryogenic propellants. An example is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [26]. The vent hole on the inlet end of this gate valve is necessary to avoid trapping liquid in the bonnet [26]. ———_ —P\\ ¢ A 4) HW | a SILVER BRAZE NI.

What is the purpose of a needle valve in fluid control systems?,"A cross section of a needle valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25]."
What characteristic of the valve's plug allows effective fine flow regulation in small fluid quantities?,"Aneedle valve is a variation of a globe valve. In comparison with the latter, a needle valve has a control orifice of smaller diameter, and a longer and slimmer movable element, in order to permit throttling. A needle valve is used for regulating the flow of small quantities of fluid, for blending carefully a fluid with another, and for speed control of pumps and actuators. The construction property of a needle valve which makes it apt to be used for a fine flow control is the plug of the valve, which moves inside the seat ring and has long tapered slots milled and ground into its surface. "
What is the function of the concentric position of a plug in ensuring effective shut-off in a valve?,"The plug remains inside the seat ring at all times, even when the valve is in the wide-open position, in order for the flow through the valve to be closely controllable by the relative position of the long plug and its gradually tapering grooves. A tight shut-off of a needle valve depends on the concentric position of the plug with the seat at the  point of closure. In case of need for a repeated shut-off of a needle valve, a good sealing is obtained by using a disc made of rubber or plastic which closes against a metallic seat. "
"What is an alternative design for sealing when high temperatures or corrosive fluids are present, instead of using a non-metallic seal?","When a non-metallic seal cannot be used due to high temperatures or to the necessity of handling a corrosive fluid, then a non-rotating plug may be designed for closing against the seat, or a device may be used to limit the closing force applied to the stem to the amount strictly necessary for a tight shut-off. Needle valves are used in lines whose diameter is less than 20 mm, a typical value being 6.35 mm. "
"What temperature range do pilot valves operate within, from the lowest cryogenic values to the highest limit specified?","They are used for temperatures ranging from cryogenic values to 811 K and above, and for pressures ranging from vacuum to 2 x 10° N/m? and above [25]. 5.10 Design of Pilot Valves Pilot valves are used to control fluids, which in turn control other components of hydraulic circuits (for example, valves for propellants) or a sequence of events occur- ring in a rocket engine (for example, the admission of fuel for ignition purposes). "
"What are the configurations in which pilot valves, including solenoid and pressure-actuated types, can be designed?","The control action performed by a pilot valve is of the on-off, open-loop type. The most common types of pilot valves are solenoid valves, pressure-actuated valves, and position-actuated valves in two-way, three-way, and four-way configurations.. "
What is the function of the plunger in an electromagnetic device that uses a coil of wire?,"A solenoid valve is an electromagnetic device having a solenoid, which is a helically wound coil of wire, a movable cylindrical core of ferromagnetic material mounted coaxially within the coil, a poppet, and a return spring. This core is called the plunger. When the coil conducts no electric current, the compressed spring closes a small orifice by means of the poppet. When a voltage is applied to the ends of the coil, the electric current flowing through the coil generates a magnetic field, which exerts a force on the plunger. "
What effect does the inward force exerted on the plunger have on the valve mechanism in a solenoid valve?,"This force pulls the plunger toward the centre of the coil, thereby opening the orifice. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [32], shows a cross section of a solenoid valve having a spherical poppet.. "
"What types of valves can solenoid actuators be utilized for, beyond simple two-port configurations?","Solenoid Armature Armature He return spring { Nis — RR NS Lerrrezrrrrrrer rr aN \ ota spring \_.\ Housing  The following figure, re-drawn from [25], shows various shapes of poppets which can be actuated by a solenoid in a pilot valve. SPHERICAL POPPET CONICAL POPPET FLAT POPPET PLUG POPPET Solenoid actuators can be used not only for simple, two-port, on-off valves, but also for multi-passage valves, in which the flow is directed to three or four ports, as required, as the sequel will show. "
What determines the default position of a solenoid valve before electrical power is supplied?,"Solenoid on-off valves are either normally open or normally closed, where the normal position of a valve is the position of its movable element with respect to the upstream pressure when no electric power is applied to the solenoid. In the presence of an electric power, the solenoid places the valve to the desired position by attracting a magnetic core attached to the valve stem. When the electric power is removed, a spring pushes back the magnetic core to its normal position. "
What factors influence the electric current necessary for operation in solenoid valves?,"Directly acting solenoid valves have response times ranging from 5 to 50 ms [25]. A large opening can be obtained through a short stroke of the movable element. The electric current required to operate these valves depends on their size, on the difference of pressure, and on the response required. Their leakage control is very good, particularly when a soft seat is used. When a hard seat is used, it is advisable to lap the seat parts. "
What is the relationship between the number of coil turns and the attracting force acting on a plunger in a magnetic core system?,"Solenoid valves do not require external dynamic seals, and have a very long operating life, of the order of magnitude of hundreds of thousands of cycles without degradation of performance [25]. According to Huzel and Huang [3], the following equations apply to the case of a flat-faced, plunger-type magnetic core B’A F= — Cc R= fPNi G where F (N) is the attracting force which acts on the plunger in its normal position, B (Wb/m”) is the magnetic flux density in the air gap, A (m2) is the cross-sectional area of the plunger, C is a factor comprising constants and allowances for stray flux (a value of 2.505 x 10~° is applicable to round, flat-faced, plunger-type magnets), f is a leakage factor of the magnetic flux, whose value is less than unity and depends on the magnetic circuit, P is a factor comprising constants and the permeability of the fluid in the gap G (m) between the core and the armature (a value P = 1.255 x  10-6 applies to an air gap), N is the number of coil turns, and i (A) is the electric current applied to the coil.. "
What material should cover the plunger's face to prevent sticking when the solenoid valve is powered off?,"The radiating surface of a solenoid valve should be sufficiently large to prevent an overheating of the coil. For this purpose, the resistance of the conductor should be designed according to the maximum allowable temperature. It is necessary to use appropriate seals in order to prevent the propellants from contaminating the coil. When the plunger of a solenoid valve is designed to be in contact with the core in the absence of electric power, then it is also necessary to cover the face of the plunger with a layer of non-magnetic material to avoid sticking [3].. "
What is the method to calculate the electric resistance of a coil in a solenoid valve intended for use in a rocket engine?,"As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to determine the electric resistance of the coil for a solenoid valve to be used in a rocket engine."
"What is the required voltage to achieve a force of 120.1 N, given a maximum current of 2 A and a leakage factor of 0.7?","The following data are known: the required actuating force at the start of the stroke is F = 120.1 N, the electric supply has a voltage of 28 V direct current, the maximum current is imax = 2 A, the air gap between the solenoid core and the plunger of the valve is G = 0.00127 m, the diameter of the plunger is d = 0.01422 m, and the leakage factor of the magnetic flux is f = 0.7."

"What is the required wire length for a coil to achieve a specific resistance, given the number of turns?","In order for the coil to have a resistance of 20 Q, the length L of the wire must beSince the wire has N = 1421 turns, then the average diameter D of each turn"
What type of valve allows for the control of fluid motion through three or more alternative routes?,"The pilot valve described above is a two-way valve, which can be either fully open or fully closed. Other pilot valves are multiple-passage valves, which can start, stop, and divert the motion of a fluid between three or more alternate paths. These valves are described below."
What types of actuation methods can be used to operate multiple-passage control valves?,"Multiple-passage valves are used to control fluids moving to and from actuating cylinders. They are also used to control the direction of flow when it is necessary to switch or direct it between various paths. These valves are known as three-way valves, four-way valves, diversion valves, selection valves, sequence valves, and shuttle valves. Their method of actuation may be manual, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrical. "
What type of valve operates only in discrete positions and cannot function in proportional or throttling modes?,"They operate in two or more discrete positions, which change only when these valves are shifted. Their mode of operation is only of the on-off type. Therefore, they cannot be used in proportional or throttling mode. The name three-way valve or four-way valve specifies the number of ports in a valve. The following figure, re-drawn from [25], shows a three-way valve (designed by Valcor Engineering Corporation) of the poppet type, which is actuated by a solenoid.  \ CYLINDER PORT~ NM Wee [EF a aT | L_  e ih / a al; \ PRESSURE RESERVOIR PORT PORT. "
Describe the function of the poppet when it is actuated in one direction regarding the cylinder port's connections.,"The valve illustrated above has a common port (the cylinder port), which can be connected to either one of two alternate ports (the pressure port and the reservoir port) when the non-connected port is closed. The poppet, when actuated in one direction, opens the cylinder port to the pressure port and closes it to the reservoir port. The same poppet, when actuated in the other direction, opens the cylinder port to the reservoir port and closes it to the pressure port. The cylinder port of a three-way valve is used to control a single-acting cylinder.. "
What is the purpose of the two cylinder ports in a four-way valve?,"A four-way valve is a valve having four external ports arranged so that there are two simultaneous flow paths in the valve. The ports of a four-way valve are identified as pressure port, reservoir port, and two cylinder ports. A four-way valve is used to actuate a double-acting cylinder. For this purpose, the valve is connected so that, when pressure is applied to one of the two cylinder ports, then the other cylinder port is connected to the reservoir, and vice versa. "
"What is the number of positions a three-position, four-way valve can have, including its central position?","Four-way valves are normally two-position or three-position valves. In a three-position, four-way valve, there is a central position in which all ports are closed.. "
What is the purpose of multiple-passage valves in controlling the position of a pneumatic actuator?,"The following figure, re-drawn from [25], shows how multiple-passage valves can be used to control the position of a pneumatic piston-cylinder.  4-WAY MAIN . STAGE VALVE We — | ol F Ei hl WORK CYLINDER | TI ln —| i 3-WAY ( ) SOLENOID | OPERATED r ah ia PILOT VALVE J RESERVOIR PRESSURE"
What type of valve is described as being three-way and solenoid-operated?,"The pilot stage valve (right) is a three-way, solenoid-operated, ball-type poppet valve. The main stage valve (centre) is a four-way, two position, ball-type poppet valve operated by means of a single-acting cylinder, which in turn is actuated by the pilot stage valve. When the solenoid carries no current, then the actuation cylinder of the main stage is not connected with the pressure port, and the work cylinder (left) is in the down position. "
What happens to the movement of the actuation cylinder and work cylinder when a solenoid is energized?,"When the solenoid carries a current, then the actuation cylinder of the main stage is connected with the pressure port and therefore moves down, thereby connecting the upper end of the work cylinder with the reservoir port and the shaft end of the work cylinder with the pressure port, and therefore the work cylinder moves up.. "
What is the key difference between a diversion valve and a selection valve in terms of alternate flow paths?,"A diversion valve is a three-way valve, such that the common port is the pressure port. A flow can be diverted by a diversion valve to either one of two alternate paths.A selection valve is similar to a diversion valve, but the number of alternate paths to which the flow from the pressure port can be diverted is unlimited."
What type of valve directs fluid flow in a specific order among multiple pathways?,A sequence valve is a valve which directs a flow in a pre-determined sequence between two or more paths.
What type of valve is activated by pressure to direct flow towards multiple pathways upon reaching a predetermined pressure level?,"A shuttle valve is a sequence valve which is actuated by pressure, so that, when a desired pressure has been reached, the valve is automatically actuated, directing a flow to two or more paths."
What type of valve is described as a pressure-actuated device that operates in a three-way configuration for engine ignition monitoring?,"Huzel and Huang [3] describe two examples of multiple-passage valves used for rocket engines. The first example concerns a pressure-actuated, three-way pilot valve, which may be used as an ignition monitor valve. This valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [3].

What component serves as a pressure-sensing element and ensures fluid containment in the valve's control port?,"The valve illustrated above is held normally closed by a spring, and has a diaphragm at its control port, which is connected to the thrust chamber injector fuel manifold. By the way, a diaphragm is a thin dividing membrane which is used as a seal to prevent fluid leakage and also as a pressure-sensing element having small (less than 1.5 mm) displacements. During engine start and when a satisfactory igni- tion has been achieved in the main thrust chamber, the increase in pressure sensed at the thrust chamber injector fuel manifold causes the ignition monitor valve to open, because the diaphragm of the valve is put under pressure. "
How does the valve spring relationship with the diaphragm affect the operation of the main fuel valve actuator?,"This opening, in turn, directs the fuel pressure to the cylinder port connected to the main fuel valve actu- ator opening port. The valve spring can be calibrated to correspond to the effective area of the diaphragm, so that the valve opens at a preset sensed pressure. During engine cut-off, the decreasing pressure of the fuel causes the ignition monitor valve to close. This closure, in turn, vents the opening side of the main fuel valve actuator, thereby closing the valve.. "
How can the effective surface area of a diaphragm be established through experimental methods?,"The poppet of the valve is balanced by the internal pressure of the fluid which acts on a dynamic O-ring seal having the same diameter d, (m) as the poppet. The valve diaphragm is made of a several layers of thin Mylar® sheets, which are pressure- formed with heat added. The effective area of the diaphragm can be determined experimentally. The required preload of the valve spring may be estimated as follows. "
"What is the relationship between effective diameter, rated pressure, static friction force, and spring preload in a valve system?","qraaPs =Fr+Sp where dz (m) is the effective diameter of the diaphragm, p, (N/m?) is the rated sensed threshold pressure to open the valve, Fy (N) is the static friction force of the valve poppet, and S,, (N) is the required preload of the valve spring."
"Calculate the necessary preload in newtons and the output power in watts for a specific three-way valve, given its defined physical properties and operational parameters.","For example, we want to determine the required preload S, (N) and the output power P (W) for a pressure-actuated, three-way ignition monitor valve of the type  described above, which has the following properties: characteristic flow area of the valve at the fully open position A, = 1.226 x 10-4 m?, diameter of the diaphragm dg = 0.05334 m, sensed threshold pressure to open the valve p, = 1.379 x 10° N/m?, static friction force of the poppet Fy = 62.28 N, resistance coefficient at the fully open position k = 3.5, required volume flow rate g = 0.003277 m/s, fuel pressure at the inlet port pp = 2.413 x 10° N/m’.

The pressure of the fuel at the point of discharge of the valve is Pa = 2.413 x 10° — 1.03 x 10° = 1.383 x 10° N/m?. "
How can output power be calculated from fluid pressure at discharge and flow rate?,"The output power of the valve results from the product of the pressure of the fluidat the point of discharge by the volume flow rate, as follows P = paq = 1.383 x 10° x 0.003277 = 4531 WThe second example concerns a four-way pilot valve of the self-locking type.

"
What causes the valve to stay open after the actuation pressure is no longer applied to the inlet?,"The actuating pressure p, is applied to the inlet port (opening) of the valve. The pressure p, causes the translating shaft to move, and consequently the pressure port is connected to the cylinder | port, and the cylinder 2 port is connected to the return port. An unbalanced self-locking force az (d3 — d?)p; acts in the opening direction and causes the valve to remain open, even after the actuating pressure py is removed from the opening port. "
"Calculate the required diameters d2, d3, and d4 for a four-way pilot valve using given preload forces, spring constants, static friction, and pressure values.","The valve can be closed only by applying the actuating pressure p, to the inlet port (closing) and venting the inlet port (opening). As an application of the concepts discussed above, it is required to determine the diameters d2, d3, and d4 for the four-way pilot valve shown in the preceding figure, with a contingency factor c = 1.5, knowing the following data: pre-load F, = 155.7 N and elastic constant kj = 3.678 x 10+ N/m of the spring s;, pre-load F = 111.2 N and elastic constant ky = 4.378 x 10* N/m of the spring 52, static friction Fy = 106.8 N of the poppet, relative pressure p; = 2.758 x 10° N/m? at the pressure port, relative pressure p, = 1.724 x 10° N/m? of the actuating fluid, ambient pressure (that is, relative pressure equal to zero) at the return port, diameter dj = 0.0127 m of the poppet guide, and total travel x = 0.00127 m of the poppet in the valve. "
What is the formula to determine the diameter of the diaphragm required to open the valve based on the pressures and forces involved?,"In order for the valve to be opened, the pressure pa, which the actuating fluid exerts on the diaphragm area “47rd3, must be sufficient to counterbalance the pre-loads F and F> of the springs s; and s2 and the static friction force Fy.

What is the relationship between the diameter of the piston and the force required to keep a valve in an open position when the actuating pressure is absent?,"The diameter d3 of the piston depends on the value of the force to be applied in order to lock the valve in the open position even when the actuating pressure p, is removed from the pressure port.

"What are the two main types of servo-valves, and how do they differ in their method of pressure control?","There are two principal types of servo-valves. In a servo-valve of the nozzle- flapper type, the pressure exerted by the fluid on the actuator is controlled directly by a flapper, which restricts the flow through two nozzles of variable size, in response to an electrical input signal applied to a torque motor. In a servo-valve of the spool type, the pressure is controlled indirectly, by means of a sliding spool, whose position in the body of the valve depends on the angular position of the flapper. "
What type of valve uses a solid cylindrical element to control flow by adjusting the size of orifices based on an electrical input signal?,"A spool is a solid cylindrical element having two or more recesses which fits closely in the bore of the valve body, such that the valve opens or closes by translating the spool within the bore. In other words, a servo-valve of the spool type is an electro-hydraulic valve having a spool, whose position in the valve body changes proportionally to an electrical input signal received by the valve. The translational motion of the spool in the valve is obtained by hydraulic pressure, and changes the size of two orifices in order for the valve to control flow. "
What factor influences the control exerted by the valve in a hydraulic system without compensation?,"The control exerted by the valve depends on the difference of hydraulic pressure across the orifices, unless some form of compensation is used. A functional scheme of a servo-valve of the spool type is given in the following figure, re-drawn from [42].

"
What is the role of the torque motor in a servo-valve system?,"The principal components of the servo-valve shown above are:e anelectromagnetic torque motor, which acts as a transducer to convert an electrical input signal into a mechanical force;¢ a flapper driven by the mechanical force generated by the torque motor, which restricts differentially the flow from a pair of nozzles, the flapper stroke being"
What causes the movement of the aspool within the valve body when the flapper is not centered?,"e aspool, whose translational motion within the valve body is due to the difference of hydraulic pressure when the flapper is off-centre; and"
What is the purpose of a feedback spring in a system that involves a spool and a torque motor?,"e a feedback spring, which allows the spool to move, the stroke of the spool being about | mm, until the restoring force acting on the flapper is in equilibrium with the force generated by the torque motor."
What factors influence the position and movement of the flapper in relation to the opposing nozzles?,"The direction and the magnitude of the displacement of the flapper caused by the torque motor depend on the input signal. The flapper is located between two opposed nozzles, and therefore its motion in one or in the other direction restricts the flow through one or the other of these nozzles. When no electrical signal is applied to the torque motor, then the flapper is located at an equal distance between the two nozzles (neutral position). "
What is the role of the feedback spring in relation to the spool's position in a servo-valve system?,"The presence of an electrical signal causes the flapper to move toward one or the other nozzle, thereby producing an unbalance of hydraulic pressure across the spool. The set of components comprising the torque motor, the nozzles, and the flapper is known as the first stage of a servo-valve. The first stage pilots the second stage, which comprises the spool and the feedback spring. The spring makes the displacement of the spool proportional to the difference of pressure caused by the off-centre position of the flapper in the first stage. The position of the flapper, in turn, depends on the force generated by the torque motor in response to the input signal. . "
How does the displacement of a control element relate to the flow regulation in an actuator system?,"Therefore, the direction and the magnitude of the displacement of the spool are proportional to the direction and to the magnitude of the input signal, and are used to control the direction and the magnitude of flow to the actuator through the pressure at the cylinder ports of the valve. For example, with reference to the preceding figure, an electrical signal resulting in a displacement of the flapper to the right restricts the flow from the nozzle on the right hand side. "
What effect does the unbalanced pressure have on the spool's position and fluid flow in the described system?,"This restriction increases the pressure upstream of the right nozzle circuit, and decreases the pressure upstream of the left circuit. This unbalance of pressure causes the spool to shift to the left, until the difference of pressure is balanced by the pressure exerted by the spring on the spool. The shift of the spool to the left opens a flow path from the pressure port placed on the left to the cylinder port A, and the returning fluid through the cylinder port B moves through the return line to the reservoir. "
What is the amplification factor achieved by a two-stage servo-valve?,"A servo-valve is not only an electrical-to- hydraulic transducer, but also a power amplifier, because the electrical input power, whose order of magnitude is about 0.1 W, is amplified in the first stage to at least 10 W of hydraulic power, and then used to control, by means of the spool, an amount of about 10 kW of hydraulic power. Therefore, the power amplification factor in a two-stage servo-valve is 10° [42].. "
What components maintain the position of the spool in a two-stage servo-valve?,"Another two-stage servo-valve of the spool type is illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [25]. In the servo-valve shown below, the spool is spring- loaded, in order for its position in the valve to be proportional to the input received from the first stage. The spool is centred by helical coil springs on each side. Inte- gral filters are used to remove small particles, which would otherwise coalesce and obstruct orifices and nozzles. "
What is the purpose of the drain bleed system in a servo-valve related to the torque motor?,"These filters are also used to protect the spool from contaminants. This servo-valve has also a drain bleed system to protect the torque motor from leakage fluid.

"
What is the purpose of the redundant design in the servo-valves and how does it enhance actuator performance?,"These servo-valves convert the electrical command signal from the engine controller (described in Sect. 5.2) to hydraulic flow directed to the valve actuator. They convert the polarity and the amplitude of the electrical command signal into respectively the rotation direction and the rotation rate of the shaft. The two servo-valves are redundant, in order for the failure of one of them not to affect the performance of the actuators. "
What occurs to the flow at one nozzle when the torque motor of a servo-valve tilts in response to the input signal?,"An assembly of one of these servo-valves is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [7]. When the torque motor of the servo-valve tilts in response to the polarity and to the amplitude of the input signal, the flow restriction is increased at one nozzle, and decreased at the other. These variable restrictors are paired with constant restrictors at the end of the filter, forming two matched pressure dividers. "
"How do the pressures at the ends of a spool change during the second stage, particularly in relation to the null position?","Therefore, the pressures applied to the ends of the spool in the second stage can be varied, being equal in the null position and not equal otherwise.  re <) P : ite t. EU | A kd x * < SA ge , og ae Soe” ate we Ox it yy a!. "
How does the spool offset influence the pressure dynamics at the input and return ports in a torque motor system?,"The resulting offset of the spool is opposite to the tilt of the torque motor, and is fed back to the torque motor via the springy connecting rod, thereby assuring proportional control. The spool offset in effect simultaneously moves one port toward the input (higher) pressure, and the other port toward the return (lower) pressure, driving the pistons. Therefore, the polarity of the signal determines the direction of rotation, and the amplitude of the signal determines the rotation rate in the valve [7].. "
What equations apply for designing flapper-nozzle type servo-valves when dealing with liquid flow through orifices?,"The equations which can be used for the design of servo-valves of the flapper- nozzle type are those shown in Sect. 5.11 for the flow of liquid or gaseous substances through nozzles or orifices.

Calculate the distance between two discharge nozzles given the relationship T = d3/4 + t. What variables are involved in this equation?,"The distance between the nozzles is T = d3/4 + t. At the neutral position of the flapper, the absolute pressures in the actuator are pp = py = 3.103 x 10° N/m?. The mass flow rates through the nozzles are rii3 = 114 = 3.529 x 10~4kg/s. The gas is discharged downstream of the nozzles at atmospheric pressure (py = 0.1013 x 10° N/m?).

In a pump-fed rocket engine, this constant pressure is used to protect the structure of the tank and to meet the requirements of pump suction head. A further protection is provided to the tank by a relief valve.. "
What is the role of pressure regulators in the operation of valves within large rocket engine control systems?,"In control systems of large rocket engines, pressure regulators maintain the pres- sure of gas at a constant value to operate engine control valves, main propellant valves, gas-generator valves, and other control components [43]."
How do fluctuations in regulated pressure influence the timing and sequence of valve operations during engine startup and shutdown in pneumatic control mechanisms?,"In pneumatic control systems, variations of regulated pressure affect valve timing and sequencing in engine start and shutdown operations.

What is the function of a pressure switch in a non-modulating pressure-reducing regulator system?,"Pressure-reducing regulators may be modulating or non-modulating. A regulator of the modulating type is a device which maintains a constant regulated pressure in a tank. A regulator of the non-modulating type is an on-off device which maintains the pressure in a tank between chosen limits by means of a signal from a pressure switch, which senses variations of pressure in the tank, and consequently opens or  closes valves, which control the flow of pressurising gas to the tank. Modulating pressure-reducing regulators include, in turn, directly-operated, dome-loaded, and pilot-operated regulators.. "

"What are the three main components of a device that regulates pressure, including the role of the reference load?","It consists of three principal elements: a sensing element (for example, a diaphragm), an inlet valve (comprising a movable element and a seat), and a source of reference load, which is usually a spring. The reference load due to the spring acts on the sensing element in one direction, and the force due to the regulated pressure acts in the opposite direction. The combination comprising the sensing element, the inlet valve, and the stem, which connects the sensing element with the inlet valve, is called the metering element. "
What term describes the force applied by the reference spring to the sensing component in the context of pressure regulation?,"The force exerted by the reference spring on the sensing element is called the load. The sensing element is also subject to the actual regulated pressure and compresses the reference spring, which is used to establish the desired pressure setting. The net force acting on the inlet valve controls the flow through the regulator.. "
How does the pressure balancing of the movable component in an inlet valve influence the relationship between inlet and outlet pressures?,"The movable element of the inlet valve may, or may not, be pressure-balanced. When the movable element is not pressure-balanced, then the inlet pressure acts on the main seat and changes the force equilibrium within the inlet valve. Consequently, a loss of inlet pressure across the main seat results in an increase in outlet pressure. When the movable element is pressure-balanced, then there is no variation of outlet pressure resulting from changes of inlet pressure. "
What is the purpose of a dynamic seal in a regulator with a pressure-balanced movable component?,A regulator having a pressure- balanced movable element requires a dynamic seal to pressure-balance the main seat of the inlet valve.. 
How does adjusting the screw in a regulator affect the compression or extension of the reference spring?,"The set point of a direct-acting regulator can be adjusted by means of a screw (not shown in the figure) which lifts or lowers a plate located above the reference  spring, in order to extend or compress the spring. To a low value of the constant of the reference spring there corresponds a high value of the stroke of the movable element of the inlet valve which it is possible to achieve."
What impact does increasing the number of coils in a spring have on the dimensions and weight of a pressure regulation device?,"When a highly accurate regulation with small changes of outlet pressure is desired, then a large area of the sensing element is needed to achieve a high driving force. Therefore, a high force due to the reference spring is needed. Since a low value of the spring constant is desired, then it is necessary to use springs having a high number of coils. This, in turn, increases the size and the mass of the regulator.. "
What effect does a change in spring length have on the load and set point of a regulator?,"The principal disadvantage of a spring-loaded regulator is that any change in the spring length during the regulation cycle changes the load and the set point of the regulator. This undesirable effect can be counteracted by using a spring having low value of spring constant, or by decreasing the stroke of the movable element [25]."
What is the primary source of reference load in a dome-loaded regulator?,"A dome-loaded regulator is a regulator in which the source of reference load is a force obtained by pressurising the dome above the sensing element with gas. A scheme of a dome-loaded regulator is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43]."
What purpose does the bias spring serve in the functioning of an actuator within a regulated pressure system?,"Diaphragm -7 a Actuator r- Orifice / !

What enables the dome-loaded type regulator to maintain the desired reference pressure above the sensing element?,"The source of load in a regulator of the dome-loaded type is not a spring. It is the reference pressure which a pilot gas exerts on the dome above the sensing element. The pilot gas, which may be the same as the gas whose pressure is to be regulated, is supplied to the dome through a small loader valve. The loader valve reduces the supply pressure to the desired reference pressure. The excess of pilot gas is directed to a vent side through an orifice. "
How is the position of the inlet valve's poppet controlled?,"The poppet of the inlet valve is opened or closed by the pressure of the pilot gas and by the stroke of the diaphragm, which depends on the chosen pressure.. "
What type of device manages a substantial flow by utilizing a minimal actuation force?,"A pilot-operated regulator is a small flow control device operated by a small actuation force which controls indirectly a large flow requiring a large actuation force. A scheme of a pilot-operated regulator is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43].

What are the main components of a regulator that controls gas flow based on tank pressure?,"A non-modulating regulator consists principally of a pressure switch and an on- off solenoid valve. The pressure switch senses the pressure in a tank, and the on-off valve controls the flow of a pressurising gas to the tank. A pressure transducer with an amplifying circuit may be used instead of the pressure switch. When the pressure in the tank decreases below the minimum desired value, the electrical contacts of the pressure switch close, and an electrical signal opens the solenoid valve. "
What occurs to the flow of gas when the pressure in the tank reaches the specified maximum value?,"This causes the pressurising gas to flow to the tank to increase the pressure in the tank. As the pressure in the tank approaches the desired maximum value, the contacts of the pressure switch open, the solenoid valve is not fed by current, and the flow of the pressurising gas stops. Therefore, the pressure in the tank oscillates between a minimum value and a maximum value. Since this regulator requires an external source of energy, then a failure of this source of energy or of any of its components can cause a failure of a system of pressurisation using the regulator [43].. "
What is the function of the metering valve in the pressure control device developed by Frebank Company?,"Another example of non-modulating regulator is the device developed by the Frebank Company. This regulator is a single stage, pilot operated valve meant to control the pressure in the tank of a missile. The metering valve is closed until the pressure in the tank falls below the lower set point. When this happens, the metering  valve of the regulator opens to full flow until the pressure in the tank reaches the upper set point, at which time the valve closes. "
What is the pressure range termed when referring to the difference between the upper and lower set point in a non-modulating regulator?,"A scheme of this valve is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25].

A PORT MAIN VALVE \ouruer *\ TANK PRESSURE PORT SENSING PORT The dead-band of a non-modulating regulator is the pressure range between the upper set point and the lower set point. "
What determines the limits of travel for the Belleville springs in the described regulator system?,"In the regulator shown in the preceding figure, the two set points are determined by the pre-deflection point and the post-deflection point, which limit the travel of the Belleville springs. The pre-deflection point is determined by the adjustment ring, and the post-deflection point is determined by the stop. The regulated pressure exerts a force on the sensing diaphragm through the sensing port. The force acting on the diaphragm is transmitted by the diaphragm assembly to the Belleville springs. "
What role does the actuator assembly play in maintaining the position of the pin in the absence of external pressure?,"In the absence of pressure, no force acts on the diaphragm. In this condition, the actuator assembly (comprising the diaphragm and the Belleville springs) holds the head of the pin against the pre-deflection travel stop, and causes the pilot valve to be fully open. The adjustment ring provides the pre-deflection adjustment. Gas at high pressure, introduced into the inlet port, flows through an orifice, through the open pilot valve, and into the sense chamber through the flow passage. "
"What occurs to the pressure in the chamber when the pilot valve is opened, and how does this affect the poppet?","When the pilot valve is open, the pressure difference across the orifice causes the pressure in the chamber behind the poppet of the main valve to decrease, thereby creating a pressure difference across the poppet. This pressure difference creates a force unbalance, and the poppet opens until it bottoms on the shank of the seat of the pilot valve. Now, the gas flows directly through the main valve into the ullage space. "
What occurs to the pilot valve when the actuator assembly engages the post-deflection stop due to tank pressure?,"When the pressure in the tank reaches the value corresponding  to the pre-deflection setting of the Belleville springs, the actuator assembly snaps to the post-deflection stop. Now, the pilot valve, which is no longer held open by the actuator assembly, is closed by the spring between the poppets. When the pilot valve is closed, the pressure increases in the chamber between the poppets, and reaches a value where the poppet of the main valve closes. "
What occurs when the actuator assembly reaches the post-deflection stop and both poppets are sealed?,"The pressure in the chamber continues to increase, until it becomes equal to the inlet pressure, and then both poppets are held on their seats by the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet, and also by the spring force of the poppet. When the actuator assembly is at the post-deflection stop and both poppets are closed, the regulator is in lock-up. In this condition, any demand on the system decreases the pressure in the ullage space. "
What occurs to the poppet of the pilot valve when pressure decreases to the post-deflection threshold?,"As the pressure drops to a value of the post-deflection setting, the actuator assembly snaps to the pre-deflection point. The pin moves the poppet of the pilot valve to the full open position, and the chamber between the poppets evacuates to create the pressure difference to cause the poppet of the main valve to open. This cycle is repeated to hold the regulated pressure in the dead-band [25].. "
What equation relates the characteristic flow area of a gas regulator to the required mass flow rate and regulated outlet pressure?,"For the pressure regulators described above, the characteristic flow area A, (m7) of the regulator, that is, the area of the valve in fully open position, can be determined as a function of the required mass flow rate m (kg/s) and of the regulated outlet pressure py (N/m?) at the minimum allowable inlet pressure p; (N/m?) of the pressurising gas, by using the equations of Sect. 5.11, which govern the flow of gases through orifices. These equations are. "
What is the range of design values for the coefficient of discharge in non-choked flow conditions?,"2 wiqy3 y-l[\p Pi which holds under non-chocked flow conditions, and n= cra. ymn(; ""7 :) which holds under choked (that is, maximum) flow conditions. In the preceding equations, Cy is the coefficient of discharge, and p; (kg/m?) is the density of the gas upstream of the regulator. The design values of Cy range from 0.6 to 0.7 [3]."
What is the design mass flow rate for the helium pressure regulator used in the rocket engine?,"As an example of application, the following data are known for the gas (helium) pressure regulator used in a rocket engine: design mass flow rate ri = 0.02177 kg/s, minimum allowable inlet pressure pj = 1.689 x 10° N/m7, inlet temperature T = 572 K at the minimum inlet pressure, required regulated outlet pressure p, = 1.158 x 10° N/m?, and flow discharge coefficient Cq = 0.65 of the regulator."
What is the formula to determine the characteristic area of a pressure regulator using specific heat ratio and density of a gas?,"It is required to calculate the characteristic area A, of the pressure regulator.From [40] we take the following data for helium in the inlet conditions: specific heat ratio y = 1.666, and density p; = 1.416 kg/m?."
What is the critical pressure ratio of helium expressed in terms of temperature and other specific parameters?,"As has been shown in Sect. 5.11, the critical pressure ratio of helium is  2 \5 4 16665 yl T.666—T Pe _ —)  =(—+— = 0.4873 Pi yt 1.666 + 1 Since Pp, — 1.158 x 10° — = —_—___ = 0.6856 Di ~—«1.689 x 10° then the value of the pressure ratio p,/p; is greater than the critical value (non-choked flow conditions)."
"What is the significance of the parameters m, Cg, y, pj, p;, and p,/p; in determining the area of an orifice in gas flow calculations?","After introducing m = 0.02177 kg/s, Cg = 0.65, y = 1.666, pj = 1.689 x 10° N/m’, p; = 1.416 kg/m, and p,/p; = 0.6856 in the equation written above of gas flow through orifices and solving for A,, we find"
What is the purpose of a device that maintains a specified volume flow rate of liquid in a line?,"0.02177 Ae = So, 0.65 x | six erOrxLAle x (9, 68567% — 0.6856 78%"") |” = 3.245 x 10->m? 5.14 Design of Differential Pressure Regulators A differential pressure regulator is used to measure the volume flow rate q (m/s) of a liquid in a line, and to maintain it at a desired constant value."
What effect does maintaining a constant pressure drop across a flow-meter have on the volume flow rate?,"The measurement can be performed by using a variable head flow-meter (for example, an orifice, or a nozzle, or a Venturi tube) installed in the main line. The flow-meter has static pressure taps placed at two points along the fluid stream, as has been shown in Sect. 5.7, for the Venturi tube. In Sect. 5.7, it has also been shown how the volume flow rate depends on the pressure drop. When the pressure drop across a flow-meter is kept constant, then the volume flow rate will also be constant. "
How is the force exerted by a spring utilized to regulate static pressure in a pressure-reducing regulator?,The pressure drop is kept constant by using a pressure-reducing regulator. The static pressures are impressed to the fluid on opposite sides of the sensing element of the regulator. These pressures can be adjusted by means of a spring placed on one side of the sensing element. The force provided by the spring can be regulated so as to balance the lower value of static pressure against the upper value. 
What function does the internal valve serve in a direct-acting differential pressure regulator?,"The working principle of a direct-acting differential pressure regulator, designed by the W.A. Kates Company, is illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [44].  IMPELLER Ap — me | me q 2 ADJUSTABLE INTERNAL op METERING DIFFERENTIAL 2 ORIFICE PRESSURE REGULATING Pp VALVE a l \_f VALVE E PORTS EI In this regulator, the internal differential pressure regulating valve maintains a constant pressure drop across the adjustable metering orifice to provide the set flow rate, independently of pressure variations which may occur upstream or downstream of the device. "
How does an increase in upstream pressure affect the valve's impeller position and orifice back-pressure in a regulating system?,"The supply pressure p; upstream of the valve is balanced by the pressure p> within the valve plus the force provided by the spring. When the pressure Pi upstream of the regulator increases above the desired pressure drop, then the instantaneous imbalance of pressure moves the impeller downward. This movement restricts the valve ports and therefore increases the orifice back-pressure p2, so as to restore the difference of pressure and the flow rate at the previous settings. "
How do relief valves function in regulating fluid pressure within tanks?,"The valve works oppositely in case of an increase in the outlet pressure p3. A direct-acting differential pressure regulator, designed by the W.A. Kates Company, is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25].

"
What type of valves are designed to release excessive pressure in pneumatic systems by discharging gas or vapor?,"They open automatically when a pre-set level of pressure is reached in the tank under control, and are used primarily in hydraulic systems. Safety valves are partic- ular relief valves which control the pressure in pneumatic systems by discharging the excessive gas or vapour to the atmosphere. In aerospace airborne systems, relief valves are used for both liquid and gaseous substances, and differ one from another depending on the fluids for which they are  used. "
What is the procedure for managing excess fluid in systems using relief valves for cryogenic substances?,"For example, there are relief valves for liquid oxygen, and relief valves for gaseous helium. The fluid in excess is discharged overboard.. "
What phenomenon can lead to increased pressure within a containment vessel apart from valve leaks?,"An excess of pressure can occur in a tank due to thermal changes or to leaking valves. Relief valves differ from other valves, because their operation creates a high pressure drop during flow [43]."
"What are the components of a relief valve, and how do the modulating and non-modulating types differ in operation?","A relief valve consists of a valve body, a source of reference load (such as a spring), and a control element (such as a poppet) which matches with a seat. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43], shows a modulating (left) and a non-modulating (right) directly-operated relief valve."

What determines the set point of relief pressure in a direct-operating relief valve?,"In a direct-operating relief valve, the reference load due to the spring is applied at all times to the control element. The reference load acts on the control element against the pressure in the tank or in the circuit under control. The intensity of the load determines the set point of the relief pressure. When the pressure of the fluid in the tank rises to the level necessary to balance the reference load, then the control element moves from the seat so as to discharge the fluid in excess to a reservoir of lower pressure placed downstream of the valve. "
What action occurs when the fluid pressure in the tank falls below a predetermined level?,"Likewise, when the pressure of the fluid in the tank decreases below the set point, then the reference load acting against the pressure closes the valve.. "
What is the relationship between cracking pressure and allowable working pressure in a relief valve?,"A relief valve has good operating characteristics when the pressure py for rated flow and the pressure p, for reseat closely approach the cracking pressure p,. The cracking pressure is the relief setting of the valve, that is, the pressure level at which the leakage flow reaches some specified value. The cracking pressure is always less than the allowable working pressure of the tank, and is usually less than 110% of the normal operating pressure. "
What is the typical percentage relationship between reseat pressure and cracking pressure in valve configurations?,"The rated flow is usually established for pressures 10% greater than the pressure setting of the relief valve. The reseat pressure is less than the cracking pressure, by an amount depending on the configuration of the closure (control element and seat). A reseat pressure of 95% of the cracking pressure is a common value [25].. "
"What are the two types of operation for a relief valve mentioned, and what distinguishes their mechanisms?","A relief valve may be not only directly-operated, as shown in the preceding figure, but also inversely-operated or pilot-operated. The following figure, due to the cour- tesy of NASA [43], shows an inversely-operated (left) and a pilot-operated (right) relief valve.

"
What occurs to the poppet in an inversely-operated relief valve when the diaphragm detects an increase in tank pressure?,"In an inversely-operated relief valve, the reference load holding the poppet on the seat increases with increasing pressure. The diaphragm senses the increasing pressure in the tank and, at some value of pressure, strokes the hanger which comes in contact with the poppet and reduces the closing force applied to the poppet. When the forces applied to the poppet are equal, then the valve is at the cracking pressure. "
What is the relationship between the effective area of the diaphragm and the unbalanced seat area to achieve optimal force in low-pressure sealing?,"The bias spring applies a load to the poppet to place it in the initial position at low- pressure sealing [43]. It is desirable that the force which holds the poppet on the seat at a specified pressure p, (where p, is less than the cracking pressure p,) should be as great as possible. For this purpose, the effective area Aq of the diaphragm is larger than the unbalanced seat area A,, as follows. "
How does the relationship between the effective diameter of the diaphragm and the seat diameter change as the closing pressure nears the cracking pressure?,The effective diameter of the diaphragm becomes increasingly larger than the diameter of the seat when the maximum closing pressure approaches the cracking pressure.
What happens to the actuator control pressure when the pilot valve partially strokes in a pilot-operated relief valve?,"A pilot-operated relief valve is used when it is necessary to control large flows. When this valve is in the non-relieving conditions, the control pressure of the actuator is at the level of the inlet pressure, and the resulting force holds the main poppet in the position of closure. When the inlet pressure increases so as to reach the cracking value, the pilot valve partially strokes, the control pressure of the actuator is ported to the outlet cavity, the pressure in the actuator control-pressure is reduced so much that the resulting force is zero, and the main poppet is ready to open. "
What effect does an increase in inlet pressure have on the force acting on the main poppet in a control system?,"As the inlet pressure continues to increase, the pilot valve stroke increases, the pressure in the control-pressure cavity decreases, and the resulting force opens the main poppet [43].. "
What is the primary element employed to counteract pressure increases in lightweight material applications?,"In airborne applications, lightweight materials, such as aluminium, are used for the valve body. The source of reference load is a force acting against an increase in pressure on the control element until the set point of pressure relief is reached. The most common element used for this purpose is a compressed spring. "
"What possible shapes can the seat of a closure unit take, and what elements may serve as the control mechanism?","The closure unit comprises a seat and a control element. The seat may have a flat, or spherical, or conical shape. The control element may be a ball, or a poppet (which in turn may be conical or V-shaped), or a piston."
What mechanism maintains the closure of both the main and pilot valves in the described relief valve system?,"Another type of pilot-operated relief valve, used to protect propellant tanks from overpressure, has been described by Huzel and Huang [3]. A scheme of this valve is illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [3]. Both the main valve and the pilot valve are normally held closed by the spring forces F's, and F,3 and by the control pressure p,. The controller of the pilot valve senses the pressure p, in the tank. "
What happens to the main valve when the pilot valve is actuated due to pressure reaching a preset level?,"When the pressure in the tank reaches or exceeds the preset level, the pilot valve is actuated to crack. This vents the actuator control pressure p, of the main relief valve and in turn permits the main valve to open. The position of the poppet of the main valve depends on the control pressure p,, which in turn is controlled by the position of the poppet of the pilot valve and by the pressure p, in the tank.. "
What are the required dimensions for the main and pilot valves in terms of their diameters based on provided parameters?,"With reference to the following figure, it is required to determine the dimensions, in terms of diameters, for the main valve and for the pilot valve. The following data are known: temperature of the pressurising gas (helium) T = 389 K, set point for the absolute pressure of relief in the tank p, = 1.138 x 10° N/m?, required maximum mass flow rate mm = 1.361 kg/s, discharge coefficient of the main valve Cg = 0.75, esti- mated leakage past the actuator piston seal of the main valve m, = 0.001361 kg/s, diameter of the control orifice d, = 2.032 mm = 0.002032 m, discharge coefficient for the control orifice and for the pilot valve Cy, = 0.60, and maximum value of the absolute ambient pressure p, = 1.031 x 10° N/m? (atmospheric pressure). "

As has been shown in Sect. 5.11, the critical pressure ratio of helium is 2 \ 2 Test = 666= Pew (5) = (ax) = 0.4873 Py yt 1.666 + 1 Since Pa _ 9.1031 x 10° _ DP, ‘1.138 x 105 0.09060 then the value of the pressure ratio p,/p; is less than the critical value (choked flow conditions).

"What does the equation representing the balance of forces in the main valve incorporate, including pressures, areas, and spring pre-load?","(m) of the movable element of the main valve from the closed position to the fully opened position results from the following equation md?

What is the significance of the constants and pressures mentioned in the general equations related to the state of cracking?,"In the cracking conditions, the general equation becomes Fm + DecAr — Pie(A2 — A1) — PaAs = 0 where p,< (N/m?) is the value of the control pressure p, in the cracking conditions and pic (N/m?) is the value of the tank pressure p, in the cracking conditions. For any displacement x,, (m) of the movable element of the main valve from the closed position (such that x, <X;n0), the general equation becomes  Fm + KsmXm + PeAr — Pr(A2 — At) — paA3 = 0 where k,,, (N/m) is the constant of the spring of the main valve. "
What is the general equation for the system when the main valve is fully open?,"When the main valve is fully open (% = Xmo), the general equation becomes Fm + KsmXmo + PeoA2 — Pro(A2 — Ai) — paA3 = 0 where p,, (N/m?) and p,, (N/m?) are respectively the control pressure p, and the tank pressure p; in the fully open conditions. When the main valve is at the start to reseat (x, = Xmo), the general equation becomes Fm + KsmXmo + PerA2 — Pri(A2 — A1) — PaA3 = 0 where p-, (N/m?) and p,, (N/m?) are respectively the control pressure p, and the tank pressure p, in the reseat conditions. "
What must the mass flow rate of the pilot valve exceed to ensure sufficient venting of the control pressure?,"When the main valve is fully reseated (x, = 0), the general equation becomes Fm + PerA2 — Pir(A2 — A1) — paA3 = 0 The mass flow rate m, (kg/s) of the pilot valve must be greater than to the mass flow rate 7, (kg/s) through the control orifice of the main valve summed to the leakage mi, (kg/s) past the actuator piston seal of the main valve, in order for the control pressure p, to be sufficiently vented.

"
What is the primary function of a device that prevents fluid from reversing direction in a system?,"A check valve is a device which prevents a moving fluid from reversing its direction of motion. A check valve allows a fluid to move freely in one direction, and stops the motion in case of a pressure reversal. A pressure reversal may occur in a fluid either normally or as a result of a failure. In the latter case, a flow reversal must be promptly stopped, in order to avoid an overflow or an overpressure in a tank, or an unwanted combination of reactive fluids, or other damages to components of a rocket engine.. "
"What mechanism ensures the operation of a check valve in aerospace vehicles, allowing it to function regardless of orientation?","A check valve operates automatically, because its movable element is actuated by the forces exerted by the moving fluid. In case of aerospace vehicles, the movable element of a check valve is spring-loaded, in order for the valve to be operated independently of either the gravitational force or the attitude of the vehicle. A check valve requires neither an actuation signal nor a source of power for its operation. "
What factors should be evaluated when selecting a specific kind of check valve in the design process?,Howell and Weathers [25] have identified some criteria to be considered in the design and in the choice of a particular type of check valve. These criteria are briefly indicated below.. 
What factors influence the pressure drop variation in a valve as flow rate increases in aerospace applications?,"The first of them concerns the pressure drop across a check valve. In valves used for aerospace applications, it is desirable to keep the increase in pressure drop with increasing volume flow rate as low as possible. The increase in pressure drop in a valve depends on the type (sphere or cone frustum or poppet having another shape) of its closing element."
What factors influence the sealing effectiveness of a check valve?,"Another criterion concerns the type of seal used in a check valve. This is because the sealing properties of a check valve depend on the sealing material, on the initial  load of the spring, and on the difference of pressure across the closing element of the valve. In case of a pressure reversal, a check valve leaks until the back pressure acting on it becomes as high as to provide a sufficient seating force. "
What is the effect of high initial spring load on pressure drop during normal fluid movement in a valve?,"In order for the valve not to leak when the reversal pressure is null or very low, the initial load of the spring must be high, which fact implies a high value of pressure drop when the controlled fluid moves in its normal direction. The use of elastic materials for the seat makes it possible to reduce leakage at low values of the seating load.. "
What factors influence the minimum pressure required for establishing flow and the reverse differential pressure necessary to prevent leakage in a valve?,"Another criterion concerns the cracking and the reseating pressures of a check valve. As has been shown in Sect. 5.15, the cracking pressure of a valve is the minimum pressure which assures a given value of flow rate. The reseating pressure of a valve is the reverse differential pressure needed to keep leakage at or below a given value. A proper choice of the spring loading and of the seating properties can reduce the reseating pressure. The cracking and the reseating pressures of a check valve depend on its pressure drop and on its leakage properties.. "
What factors must be considered when selecting materials for a valve based on the fluid it controls?,"Another criterion concerns the type of fluid moving through a check valve. The materials (including metals, seals, and coatings) of which a valve is made must be compatible with the fluid controlled by the valve. In particular, the choice of the materials depends on whether the fluid is a liquid or a gas. In the latter case, special care must be taken with gases of low molar mass, such as hydrogen and helium.. "
"What phenomenon can occur when a valve closes quickly, potentially raising the pressure significantly beyond normal operating levels?","Another criterion concerns the operating pressure of a check valve. The body of a valve must be designed for the maximum pressure to which the valve is subject. In particular, when a valve is rapidly closed, a water hammer can arise in the valve. This phenomenon increases the level of pressure several times the normal operating pressure. When a valve is subject to a large number of pressure cycles, a failure due to fatigue must be taken into account.. "
What considerations should be made regarding the materials used for seals in valves operating under varying thermal conditions?,"Another criterion concerns the temperature at which the fluid and the valve operate. Special care must be taken of the non-metallic materials which are used for the seals. All materials used in a valve must be designed to withstand the worst thermal conditions in their operating environment. Since the mass of the valve acts as a heat sink, short-term excursions of temperature beyond the recommended limits are tolerable. "
What issues can arise from temperature differences related to varying expansion rates of different materials?,"Particular attention should be given to temperature gradients, which can give rise to binding effects due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials.. "
What issues can arise in a valve due to contamination of the fluid system or the fluid itself?,Another criterion concerns the sensitivity of either the fluid system or the fluid itself to contamination. Contamination can cause malfunction or internal leakage in a valve. Special care must be taken of the valve body and of the seals.
What factors should be considered to minimize maintenance needs for a valve and ensure seal access while preventing contamination?,"Another criterion concerns the operations of maintenance required by a valve. The maintenance requirements should be reduced as far as possible, and the need to use special tools should be avoided. Seals requiring periodic replacement should be readily available and easily accessible. Care must be taken to avoid contamination during disassembly and service."
What relationship exists between the mass of a ball-type check valve and its radius?,"Another criterion concerns the mass and the size of a valve, which are aspects of primary importance in valves used for aerospace applications. For example, in a check valve of the ball type, the mass of the ball is proportional the cube of its radius; by contrast, in a check valve of the flapper type, the mass of the closing element is  nearly proportional to the square of its linear size. Therefore, check valves of the ball type are rarely used when the radius of the ball exceeds | cm. In this case, flapper-type or swing-type check valves are used.. "
"What factors influence the cost of a valve, particularly in aerospace applications, emphasizing performance and reliability?","Another aspect concerns the cost of a check valve. The cost depends on such factors as operating pressure, temperature, flow rate, leakage requirements, type of fluid, mass, reliability, and life-cycle requirements. In case of check valves used for aerospace applications, performance and reliability are factors of primary importance."
What factors influence the operational lifespan of a check valve in aerospace applications?,"Another criterion concerns the operating life of a check valve. The operating life depends on such factors as type of fluid, contamination, operating temperature, stresses, number of cycles, type of seals, materials of construction, and procedures of maintenance. In order to increase the operating life of a valve, loads and stresses acting on the valve components should be reduced as far as possible. However, valves to be used for aerospace applications should not be over-designed for their life-cycle requirements.. "
What are the two main classifications of check valves as identified by Tomlinson and Keller?,"According to Tomlinson and Keller [43], check valves can be classified in two categories: poppet valves and flapper valves. Three different valves (ball, cone, and floating ring) of the poppet type are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43].; SSSA | Ye YA AA? fe) ( N ( <= Flow \N <= Flow @ é SF oe Ya 4 Baa YYZ ZZ ZZ, Ball Cone i: ai Vs Floating ring"
What is the function of the spring in a poppet check valve?,"A check valve of the poppet type has a poppet as its closing element. This poppet translates axially in the valve body and a compressed spring of the coil type forces the poppet against the seat. Valves of this type are used in applications requiring low leakage in the direction of the checked flow and low pressure drop in the direction of the free flow. The cracking pressure is low (in the range going from 21000 to 103000 N/m2, according to [43], and the full-flow pressure is as close to the cracking  pressure as possible. "
How can the cracking pressure of poppet-type valves be adjusted for different applications?,"The cracking pressure of check valves of the poppet type can be increased by increasing the load of the return spring. In these conditions, a check valve can be used as a relief valve or a back-pressure regulator [43]. A check valve of the ball type is illustrated in the preceding figure. This valve has a hard ball as its closing element. The ball is spring-loaded against a circular, conical, or spherical seat. "
What type of materials can be utilized to create a soft seat for reducing leakage in flow control devices?,"In order to reduce leakage, a soft seal is sometimes used. This soft seat is made of Teflon®, or of another plastic or elastomeric material. Otherwise, a combination of soft with hard materials is used for the seat. The force due to the fluid stream lifts the ball off the seat against the load provided by the spring, and the flow passes around the ball. Since the flow must surround the ball, then a check valve of the ball type has a tendency toward turbulence and a higher pressure drop than other types of check valves. "
"What issue arises with ball-type check valves when they experience low flow, preventing the closing element from remaining fully open?","In normal operating conditions, the ball may rotate slightly on the return spring, thereby causing wear on the ball and on the seat. A check valve of the ball type is prone to chatter when opened by a low flow which does not fully stroke and hold the ball in the full-open position. By chatter we mean an uncontrolled seating and reseating of the closing element of a valve. Check valves of the ball type are simple and cheap to manufacture, since the seat is the only costly detail. They are used in low-flow applications where the stroke is short and the ball will self-guide into the seat [43].. "
What component replaces the ball in the cone type check valve to improve the alignment and contact with the seat?,"A check valve of the cone type is an improvement of the valve of the ball type described above. The improvement is obtained by guiding and aligning the closing element in a constant direction, in order for its contact with the seat to be continuous and even. For this purpose, the ball is replaced by a piston sliding in a hollow cylinder and having a conical seating surface at one end. This surface is spring-loaded to seat against a spherical or conical surface, which may be made of either a soft material or a hard material. "
What advantages does a cone-type check valve have over a ball-type valve concerning pressure drop and operational stability?,"A check valve of the cone type has a lower pressure drop than one of the ball type having the same size, and a lower tendency to chatter, because of the guided movement and the resultant damping of its closing element. The presence of contaminating particles in the seating area and between the piston and the body of the valve can cause sticking or cocking with consequent leakage between the piston and the seating area.. "
What type of valve features a mushroom-shaped closing element that aligns in a consistent direction and uses an O-ring for sealing?,"A check valve of the floating-ring type is also a valve having a closing element guided and aligned in a constant direction. It has a mushroom-shaped poppet, whose stem slides in the valve body and whose head seals through an O-ring against a circular flat or tapered seat. The force due to the fluid stream causes the head of the poppet to move off the seat in the flow direction, and the fluid passes through the stem of the poppet, around the head of the poppet, and through the body of the valve. "
What type of check valve exhibits reduced pressure drop at the same flow rate compared to ball or cone varieties?,A check valve of this type has a lower pressure drop at an equal flow rate than a ball or a cone check valve. Damping chambers may be incorporated in a floating-ring valve in order to eliminate chatter and hammering. The presence of contaminating particles between the poppet stem and the valve body can cause sticking and leakage. A check valve of the floating-ring type has more components and therefore is more costly than a ball or a cone check valve. 
What are the two types of flapper check valves featured in the provided illustration?," Two check valves of the flapper type, namely, a split-flapper (left) and a swing- flapper (right) valve, are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43]. Pivot Pivot Torsion spring. Yj y “iP Y % Qe <= Flow / <Jjee Flow ms S\ / Ny Z VM Yy Torsion spring Split flapper Swing flapper. "
What type of spring mechanism acts on the closing element in a flapper-type check valve?,"A check valve of the flapper type has a rotating flapper as its closing element. The loaded spring acting on the flapper is of the torsion type, and the flapper may be either a split element which pivots across the centre of the flow path or a single element which pivots from the side."
What type of check valve is known for being smaller and lighter while allowing large flow rates with low pressure drop?,"Flapper check valves are used in applications requiring low pressure drop with large flow rates. They are often smaller and lighter than those of the poppet type. However, when subject to high pressures, flapper check valves may become excessively heavy [43]."
What mechanism allows fluid to flow through a swing-flapper check valve while minimizing pressure loss?,"A swing-flapper check valve has a hinged disc which seats against a flat or tapered surface, or a circular sharp edge. A fluid stream moving through the valve in the free- flow direction swings the hinged disc from the seat and out of the flow path, thereby permitting a substantially unrestricted passage with very low pressure drop. When the flow through the valve stops or reverses its direction, the disc swings rapidly to its seat, thereby closing the valve against the reverse flow.. "
What is a significant drawback of swing-flapper check valves during sudden flow reversals?,"Very low pressure drops con be obtained with swing-flapper check valves, because small opening forces are required, and also because their disc swings out of the flow path. The presence of contaminating particles in the fluid has little effect on their performance. On the other hand, they are particularly subject to water hammer in case of sudden reversal of flow. This is because their disc rotates through a large angle from the open position to the closed position, and consequently the velocity of the reverse flow increases significantly before the complete closure of the disc. "
What type of check valve is recommended for applications needing minimal pressure loss and limited fluid contamination control?,"For this reason, their performance in eliminating a reverse flow is poor. Check valves of the swing-flapper type are used for applications requiring the minimum value of pressure drop and scarce control of fluid contamination. They are not used for applications having a high tendency toward sudden flow reversal.. "
What type of valve design uses multiple hinged elements to minimize inertia and allows fluid flow in a specific direction?,"Check valves of the split-flapper type have two or more hinged elements instead of one hinged disc. This makes it possible to reduce the moment of inertia of each hinged element. A typical split-flapper valve has two semi-circular elements which are open when the fluid stream moves through the valve in the free-flow direction  and closed otherwise. A pressure drop in a split-flapper valve can be reduced to a minimum value, as is also the case with a swing-flapper valve. "
What advantage does a split-flapper valve offer regarding pressure drop when compared to a swing-flapper valve?,"For two valves of the same size, the flapper is lighter in a split-flapper valve than is in a swing-flapper valve. In addition, a split-flapper valve can bear a heavier life cycle and has a better performance in case of water hammer than a valve of the other type. Split-flapper valves are used principally in pneumatic systems. Their principal advantage is the minimum pressure drop for a given diameter. "
What is the function of a thin metallic diaphragm designed to rupture at a specific pressure in a tank or pipeline?,"They are also scarcely sensitive to fluid contamination and have better performance than swing-flapper valves when a sudden flow reversal may occur. 5.17 Design of Burst Discs A burst disc, also known as a safety disc or a rupture disc or a frangible disc, is a thin metallic diaphragm designed to burst when the pressure in a tank or in a line exceeds a pre-set value. For example, a burst disc is used in a flow-carrying line to initiate flow when ruptured by sufficient pressure in the line. "
What is a characteristic feature of the pre-bulged type commonly used in burst discs?,"A burst disc commonly used is one of the pre-bulged type, which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43]. NZ SS Wiz 2 _—Prebulged burst disk \ [- \ Burst pressure => DB. "
What is the mechanism by which the burst disc fails under pressure without relying on local weakening features?,"The burst disc shown in the preceding figure bursts due to tension induced by pressure, without the use of local weakening such as coined or machined grooves to initiate and control the bursting."
What is a common application of a reverse-action knife-blade device in technical safety mechanisms?,"Another type of burst disc commonly used is the reverse-action knife-blade burst disc, shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43].

What is the primary mechanism that allows a burst disc to require lower pressure to rupture compared to pre-bulged designs?,"The burst disc illustrated in the preceding figure reverses its form under pressure and buckles onto a knife edge, thus requiring a lower pressure to burst than one of the pre-bulged type.A burst disc of the shear type is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43].WS OS IN ON __———Belleville spring iy <= ~Belleville spri iN"
What is the term for the pressure at which a circular cutter or sheared disk fails?,Burst pressure =e Ps ~—Circular cutter gurst pressure =m || ——Sheared disk (a) Disk prior to rupture. (0) Disk after rupture.
What occurs to the supporting force of the spring washer when the pressure exceeds the predetermined burst pressure?,"The burst disc shown above, before rupture (left) and after rupture (right), is pressure-loaded on a circular cutter by means of a Belleville spring, which is compressed into the negative-spring-rate region of the spring stroke. The Belleville spring supports a portion of the pressure acting on the burst disc up to a pre-set burst pressure. When this value of pressure is exceeded, the spring washer starts to stroke, its supporting force decreases rapidly, and the pressure causes the disc to be sheared by the sharp circular cutter. "
What component can be adjusted to set the burst pressure of a disc in a cutting mechanism?,A catch screen may be required to keep the cut disc from moving downstream. The burst pressure of the disc can be pre-set by replacing the cutter with a flat plug and adjusting the Belleville spring washer until the desired burst pressure is indicated by the motion of the burst disc [43].. 
What are the applications of burst discs in rocket engine components?,"Burst discs are used for many components of rocket engines, such as hypergolic- start cartridges, repeat-start turbine spinner assemblies, pump-seal drain lines, and some instrumentation. They are also used to seal a cavity against downstream pressure or temperature, or to contain a liquid until a rise of pressure to a desired level ruptures the disc."
What is the typical range of values for the pressure at which a burst disc is designed to fail under specified conditions?,"The burst pressure is the primary element to be considered in the design of a burst disc. This is because a burst disc must remain intact in all conditions of storage,  handling, and use of storable or cryogenic fluids, until the desired burst pressure is reached. The value of the burst pressure usually ranges from 6.895 x 10° to 6.895 x 10’ N/m? [43], depending on the application."
What factors must be considered to prevent early rupture of a cartridge containing an ignition aid for a rocket engine?,"Low values of burst pressure are desired for a cartridge containing an ignition aid for the thrust chamber of a rocket engine, in order to burst the cartridge discs, release the ignition aid, and establish ignition as soon as possible. Of course, the burst pressure must not be so low as to cause premature rupture in the discs due to the vapour pressure or to the thermal expansion of the propellants, or to handling loads. "
"What is the relationship between burst pressure, burning rate, and allowable operating pressure for safety in pyrotechnic applications?","High values of burst pressure are desired for a burst disc used for the ignition of a pyrotechnic device, so long as the burning rate of the charge does not become excessive and the pressure level remains below the allowable operating pressure of the container [43].. "
"What is the upper temperature limit for aluminium alloys used in certain applications, expressed in Kelvin?","Burst discs are made of aluminium alloys, mild steel, stainless steel, nickel, Monel®, Inconel®, copper, silver, gold, and platinum. Aluminium is used because of its low physical properties and good forming and machining properties. However, since the properties of this material vary widely with temperature, the upper temper- ature limit is only about 394 K [43]. Mild steel requires protection from corrosion. "
What materials are noted for their resistance to corrosion and possess favorable physical characteristics?,"This material has low cost and good formability. Stainless steel and Inconel® are difficult to tool. Inconel® can be used over a wide range of temperatures. Silver, gold, and platinum resist corrosion and have good physical properties.. "
"What are the two methods by which burst discs can be affixed, and what properties must the materials have concerning fluid interaction?","Burst discs can be attached mechanically or by welding. They must not be corroded by the fluid, and the materials of which they are made must not cause decomposition in the fluid."
What is the range of thickness for burst discs made from material beneath coined grooves?,"The thickness of burst discs ranges from 0.05 to 3.18 mm [43], in case of coined- groove discs, for the material remaining under the groove. In this type of disc, the material is weakened locally by grooves which are stamped into the metal. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43], shows three patterns (radial, single hinge, and double hinge) used for these grooves."
What type of valving mechanism is actuated by a compact energy source and functions as a shut-off device once per mission?,"S (a) Radial, (b) Single hinge. () Double hinge,  5.18 Design of Explosive ValvesExplosive valves, also known as squib valves, are shut-off devices actuated by a very compact source of energy only once in a given mission."
What type of mechanism do explosive valves utilize to create high pressure for actuation?,"The source of energy used by them is an explosive charge which generates high pressure on an actuator. It is possible to actuate repeatedly an explosive valve by using multiple squibs. However, most explosive valves are designed to operate only once, and are either replaced or refurbished after use. Since the explosive charge is expendable, the remaining part of the valve is often designed to be also expendable. This makes it possible to reduce mass and obtain very good sealing.. "
How can the reliability of certain valves for specific missions be evaluated when non-destructive testing is not possible?,"These valves cannot be tested non-destructively. Therefore, their reliability for a specific mission must be evaluated statistically, by purchasing a large number of them for qualification."
"What type of combustion involves the rapid burning of explosive material, leading to the generation of mechanical energy used in devices?","Explosive valves are actuated by mechanical energy resulting from conversion of chemical energy contained in explosive charges. This chemical energy can be released by the charges either by deflagration, which is the rapid combustion of the explosive material, or by detonation, which is the propagation of a shock wave through the explosive material. In case of deflagration, the mechanical energy obtained is the work done by the combusted gases acting on a piston. "
How is mechanical energy generated during a detonation in relation to the shock wave's impact on a piston?,"In case of detonation, the mechanical energy obtained is due to the momentum of the shock wave propagating through the explosive charge. This momentum is transferred to a piston, as if the end of the piston were subject to a sharp blow.. "
What is the amount of explosive material required to actuate a normally-closed valve with a diameter of 19.05 mm?,"In either case, a small amount of explosive material is necessary to actuate a valve. For example, a typical normally-closed valve, 19.05 mm in diameter, whose working pressure is 2.759 x 107 N/m?, uses 140 mg of explosive material. The explosive pressure of this valve is about 1.724 x 107 N/m® [25]."
What are the thickness and diameter dimensions of a typical valve used in explosive applications?,"A deflagrating charge used for explosive valves consists of small flake-like parti- cles of powder similar to shotgun powder. A valve of typical design has a disc 0.254 mm in thickness and 1.27 mm in diameter. A detonating charge uses explosive materials such as PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), or DDNP (diazodinitrophenol), or RDX (1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine)."
What methods can be used to initiate the combustion of an explosive charge in a primer?,"The explosion of a charge is obtained by a transfer of mechanical or electrical energy to a sensitive primer, such as lead styphnate. For this purpose, the charge is ignited by striking a sharp blow to the primer through a metallic barrier, like the firing pin of a gun, or by piercing abruptly the container of the primer by means of a sharp probe, or by heating electrically the primer by means of a bridge-wire.. "
What type of firing pulse voltage is needed for an exploding bridge-wire ignition compared to conventional methods?,"The ignition of a detonating or deflagrating charge may also be obtained without the primer, by using an exploding bridge-wire (EBW). In this case, it is necessary to use a firing pulse of several thousand volts, in comparison with a conventional firing pulse of about 28 V or even less. An exploding bridge-wire is extremely insensitive to accidental firing, but requires a high voltage obtained by discharging a condenser contained in a firing circuit. "
What components are typically included in an explosive cartridge designed for use in explosive valves?," A typical explosive cartridge (designed by Holex, Inc.), commonly used for explo- sive valves and having a low-voltage bridge-wire, is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [25]. SHOCK ATTENUATOR PLUG BRIDGE-WIRE PRIMER CERAMIC SEAL CASE BODY CONNECTOR \ \ PINS io) a oT (6) fp) — = ROY] Co) ST Dee MAIN CHARGE THREAD LOCK INDUCTION SOLDER SEAL. "
What is the maximum pressure generated by the ignition in the cartridge as expressed in N/m?,"The charge in the cartridge shown above is ignited by means of an electrical connector incorporated in the cartridge. The charge is hermetically sealed to be protected from moisture and damage. The cartridge contains 188 mg of deflagrating charge, and the pressure generated by the ignition can be as high as 4.137 x 10° N/m. The shock attenuator plug incorporated in the cartridge weakens the shock waves before they reach the ceramic seals. "
What is the maximum current required to activate the described cartridge ignition system?,"The electrical conductors are two connector pins made of stainless steel, and the case is made of the same material. The pins are locked into the case by fused ceramic seals. The current necessary to ignite a cartridge like this ranges from | to 5 A, and the firing time ranges from 1 to 20 ms [25].. "
What mechanism is activated to open a normally closed valve depicted in the illustration?,"Some explosive valves are illustrated below. The following figure, due to the cour- tesy of NASA [43], shows a normally closed valve which opens when the explosive charge actuates a pin (ram) which shears the end from the inlet fitting and retains it in a recess of the body.

What are the necessary actions to make the valve reusable after it has been fired?,The valve shown above can be made reusable by replacing the explosive charge and the inlet fitting. A reusable valve must be cleaned immediately after firing.
What mechanism is utilized to retain the diaphragm within the body of a normally closed non-reusable valve after it has been activated?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43], shows a normally closed non-reusable valve, as it appears after firing. In this valve, a diaphragm is sheared from the body by the ram and is clamped by the ram to be retained within the body."
What is the significance of diaphragm positioning prior to the initiation of a firing sequence in explosive systems?,"Diaphragm position before firing— Diaphragm position NM t / after firing Explosive charge jro-ring, KY, J LLY LY \ s WY WW); —— WY ~\ Ss \ WY WEN 1 zi Segen//im/7//0 ~~0-ring Press-fit ram— Yip UY,"

What mechanism can be used to operate explosive valves in larger diameter lines when the fluid energy is utilized?,"Explosive valves are usually employed in lines of small diameters (less than 25 mm). However, explosive valves for lines of greater diameters can be obtained by using the energy of the fluid to open and close the valve, in which case the ram is used only as a latch, as shown for the valve (U.S. Patent No. 3,017,894) illustrated in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [43].

What is the significance of assuming constant wall thickness in the design of a tank?,"The word shell is used here because, at any point of a tank, the thickness of its wall is assumed to be constant and much smaller than the radii of curvature of its middle surface [2]."
What term describes the line formed by the intersection of a revolving surface with a plane that is perpendicular to its axis?,A surface of revolution results from rotating a plane curve about some straight line (called the axis of revolution) lying in the plane which contains the curve. A line resulting from the intersection of a surface of revolution with a plane containing the axis of revolution is called a meridian. A line resulting from the intersection of a surface of revolution with a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution is called a circumference. 
What is the geometric relationship between the meridian at any point on a surface of revolution and the corresponding circumference at that point?,"Therefore, the meridian passing through any point of a surface of revolution is perpendicular to the circumference passing through the same point. The structural analysis of tanks which will be presented in this chapter is largely due to Roark’s formulas for stress and strain [3].. "
"What types of membrane stresses are present in a shell subjected to distributed loads, and how are they oriented relative to the shell's geometry?","When a shell is subject to distributed loads resulting from internal or external pressure, the predominant stresses acting on the shell are membrane stresses, which are stresses whose amount is constant through the thickness of the shell. Generally speaking, the stresses acting in a point of a shell are ¢ ameridian membrane stress 0}, whose direction is parallel to the local meridian; e a circumferential membrane stress 72, whose direction is parallel to the local. "
"What type of stress is denoted by the symbol ¢, and how does it change with the thickness of a shell?","circumference; and ¢ asmall radial stress 03, which varies through the thickness of the shell."
"What types of strains are induced in a shell due to various stresses, leading to changes in the slopes of its meridians?","In addition to these stresses, there may be bending or shear stresses due to loading, or to physical properties of the shell, or to the supporting structure. The stresses considered above cause meridian, circumferential, and radial strains in a shell, and therefore changes in the slopes if its meridians. The circumferences of a shell may also deviate from their circular form when buckling occurs."
"What type of stresses are considered most significant in a thin, uniformly loaded shell with consistent thickness and curvature?","When a thin shell (one whose thickness is less than one tenth of its smaller radius of curvature) has no abrupt changes in thickness, slope, or curvature, and is subject to a loading uniformly distributed or smoothly varying and axisymmetric, then the meridian o; and circumferential 02 membrane stresses are practically uniform through the thickness of the wall, and are also the most important stresses acting on the shell. "
"What types of stress can be neglected when analyzing the behavior of cylindrical, conical, spherical, and toroidal shells under specific conditions?","The radial stress o3 and stresses induced by bending moments are negli- gible. In this case, the formulae of [3, Table 13.1] can be used to compute stresses and strains such as those described above for shells of cylindrical, conical, spherical, and toroidal shapes. Examples of application will be given in the following sections. 6.2 Tanks Subject Only to Membrane Stresses Two thin shells can be joined together to form a tank. "
What conditions must be met at the junction of shells to avoid bending stresses under uniform loading?,"When it is desired to have no bending stresses at the junction in case of uniformly distributed or smoothly varying loads, then it is necessary to choose shells such that the radial deformations AR and the rotations w of the meridians be the same for each of them at the point of junction.  For example, a cylindrical shell of radius R (m) and thickness f (m), subject to uniform internal pressure g (N/m?), see [3, Table 13.1, case Ic], has a radial deformation AR (m) R2 AR=*—(1- 3) Et 2 where E (N/m?) and v are respectively the Young modulus and the Poisson ratio of the material, whereas a hemispherical shell of equal radius and thickness, subject to the same pressure, see [3, Table 13.1, case 3a], has a radial deformation AR (m) R(1— ara (eG 2Et The rotations w of the meridians are the same in both cases. "
What stresses are caused by the different radial deformations in the junction of the described shell structure?,"The different radial deformations AR cause bending and shear stresses in the vicinity of the junction. The following figure shows a shell, whose middle surface is a smooth surface of revolution, not necessarily a hemisphere, subject to a uniform internal pressure q [3, Table 13.1, case 4a].

"
What happens to the radial deformations and rotations of meridians when the radius of curvature is infinite at a specific angle?,"These formulae show that, when the radius of curvature R; of a meridian is infinite at 0 = 7/2, then the radial deformations AR and the rotations y of the meridians are the same as those of the cylindrical shell of [3, Table 13.1, case 1c]. In the preceding figure, R; (m) is the radius of curvature of a meridian in the point P of the shell, R> (m) is the length of the normal between the point P of the shell and the axis of rotation, and 6 (rad) is the angle between the normal to the surface and the axis of rotation. Fliigge [4] has shown that the family of the Cassinian curves (illustrated in Sect. 6.9) has the property indicated above.. "
How are radial deformations and rotations of meridians determined for a toroidal shell segment experiencing internal pressure?,"As an application (from [3]) of the concepts discussed above, it is required to compute the radial deformations AR and the rotations w of the meridians at both ends of a segment of toroidal shell used as a transition between a cylinder and a head closure in a tank subject to an internal pressure g = 1.379 x 10° N/m?."
What are the values of the Young modulus and Poisson ratio for the material of the tank?,"As shown in the preceding figure, the two ends of each toroidal segment are defined by the angles 6 = z/6 and 0 = 7/2 which the normal to the toroidal surface forms with the axis of rotation. The Young modulus and the Poisson ratio of the material of which the tank is made are respectively E = 2.068 x 10!! N/m? and v = 0.3. The thickness of the wall of the tank is t = 0.00254 m = 2.54 mm. At the upper end (subscript U) of the toroidal surface, there results. "

What is the thickness of the shell in millimeters?,"The thickness of the shell is t = 0.00635 m = 6.35 mm. The density, the Young modulus, and the Poisson ratio of the material (aluminium) of which the shell is made is made are respectively p = 2700 kg/m, E = 6.9 x 10!° N/m’, and v = 0.3."
"Calculate the membrane stress at the base, the radial deformation, and the height deformation of a shell under a vertical acceleration of 400 times gravitational acceleration.","It is required to find the membrane stress o , at the base, the radial deformation AR, and the height deformation Ay, supposing the shell to be subject to an acceleration of 400 go = 400 x 9.807 m/s? acting in the vertical direction."
What is the significance of the negative sign in the specific weight of a complete cone loaded by its own weight?,"The formulae of [3, Table 13.1, case 2c] concern a complete cone loaded by its own weight pV go N. Since the cone considered here is truncated, then the principle of superposition of effects applies, as will be shown below. For this purpose, we consider firstly a complete cone loaded by its own weight. The specific weight pgo (N/m?) of this cone is taken with the minus sign, because the vertex of the cone is up instead of down, and this value is multiplied by 400, in order to take account of the acceleration. "
"What values are represented by the variables a, R, E, v, and pgp in the given formulae?","We use the formulae of [3, Table 13.1, case 2c] with a = 7/12 rad, R = 0.508 m, E = 6.9 x 10!° N/m?, v = 0.3, and pgp = —2700 x 400 x 9.807 N/m. By so doing, we find. "

What mechanisms are involved in the behavior of tanks subjected to forces generated by the movement of liquid propellant?,6.5 Tanks Subject to Loads Due to Propellant Sloshing
What design considerations must be addressed in control systems and structures of launch vehicles to manage the dynamic loads from liquid propellants?,"This section considers the loads acting on the tanks of large space vehicles partially filled with liquid propellants. Since the initial masses of these vehicles consist prin- cipally of liquid propellants, then the time-varying loads due to the motion of such masses in their tanks are very large. The control systems and the structures of launch vehicles are to be designed in such a way as to respectively counteract and resist such loads.. "
What factors contribute to the complexity of dynamical systems involving liquid motion in containers?,"The dynamical systems which describe the motion of liquid masses into moving containers are very complex, because of couplings of the components of such systems. In particular, the natural frequencies of the control systems, of the elastic bodies, and of the liquid sloshing are to be kept separated as widely as possible, because large forces and moments can be generated by a liquid propellant oscillating at one of its natural frequencies in a partially filled tank.

What is the term used for the periodic movement of a liquid's surface within a partially filled vessel due to motion of the transporting vehicle?,By sloshing we mean the periodic motion of the free surface of a liquid in a partially filled container [7]. This motion results from longitudinal and lateral displacements or angular rotations of the vehicle carrying the container.
What type of wave occurs on a liquid's surface when a partially filled tank is oscillated horizontally?,"In particular, lateral sloshing is the standing wave formed on the free surface of a liquid when a tank partially filled is caused to oscillate horizontally [8], that is,  in a plane parallel to the free surface of the quiescent liquid. Lateral sloshing is antisymmetric, and occurs primarily in response to translational or pitching motions of atank. By contrast, vertical sloshing is symmetric, and occurs primarily in response to motions of a tank in the direction perpendicular to the free surface of the quiescent liquid. "
What type of motion occurs in a liquid that demonstrates swirling around a vertical axis due to instability near resonance?,"Rotational sloshing is a motion exhibiting an apparent swirling of a liquid about a normal axis, and arising as an instability of the antisymmetric lateral sloshing near resonance [6].. "
What are some potential factors that can induce oscillations in the tanks of space vehicles during operations?,"The tanks of space vehicles may be subject to oscillations for several causes, which act either separately or in combination. Some examples of these causes, identified by Abramson et al. [9], are ¢ wind gusts during powered flight; © programmed changes of attitude of the vehicle;e control pulses for attitude stabilisation; e separation impulses; and e elastic deformations of the vehicle."
What factors influence the intensity of forces and moments resulting from fluid movement within a container?,The magnitude of the forces and moments due to sloshing depend upon
What is the variable representing the vertical distance of the propellant within the storage vessel?,¢ height of the propellant in the tank; e acceleration; and
How does tank shape influence the natural sloshing frequencies and modes in space vehicles?,"The sloshing phenomenon and its consequence on the stability of a space vehicle can be controlled by a proper design of the tank and by the addition of baffles, as will be shown in Sect. 6.6. The shape of the tank has an influence on the natural sloshing frequencies and modes, and on the response to the forced oscillations and to the forces and moments due to the presence of the propellant in the tank.

What factors influence the required strength and rigidity of baffles in relation to manufacturing and handling processes?,"The number and the type of baffles depend on the damping requirements. The strength of the baffles depends on several factors, among which the strength and the rigidity required during manufacturing and handling, the mechanical and thermal stresses due to propellant loading, and the forces and moments due to propellant sloshing [9]."
What effects can the interaction between a sloshing liquid and a tank's structure have on vibrational characteristics and dynamic stability in rocket engine components?,"The coupling between a sloshing propellant and the elastic structure of its tank may have a large influence on the vibration frequencies and on the mode shapes of the tank. In addition, the system comprising a sloshing propellant and its tank may have dynamic instabilities either by itself or by coupling with some other components of a rocket engine subject to oscillations, as is the case with the combustion and feed-line systems.. "
What components are involved in the mechanical model used to analyze the behavior of an oscillating tank with liquid propellant?,"The dynamic response of a space vehicle to sloshing loads can be determined by using an equivalent mechanical model which represents the behaviour of an oscil- lating tank partially filled with a liquid propellant. This mechanical model consists of fixed masses (my) and oscillating masses (ms) connected to the tank by springs and dashpots or by pendulums and dashpots. The second case is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [10].. "
What elements are combined with the mechanical model to analyze the dynamic behavior of a space vehicle system?,"Each mechanical model refers to a particular shape of tank, and is designed so as to have the same resultant force, moment, damping, and natural frequencies as the actual oscillating propellant. This model is then combined with other dynamic elements of the space vehicle being considered, and the dynamic behaviour of the whole system is studied by means of digital or analogue computers."
What is the approximate ratio of the sloshing mass in the second mode to the sloshing mass in the first mode for a cylindrical tank?,"The number of slosh masses m, included in an equivalent mechanical model corresponds to the number of slosh modes considered in the analysis. In case of a  circular cylindrical tank, the sloshing mass corresponding to the second mode has been found to be about 3% of the mass corresponding to the first node, and therefore the sloshing effects due to the second and higher modes are generally negligible for a tank of this shape. "
What percentage of the mass related to the first mode corresponds to the second mode for a quarter tank?,"However, for a quarter tank, the sloshing mass corresponding to the second mode is 43% of the mass corresponding to the first mode, and therefore should be included in determining the total sloshing loads acting on the tank [9]. Sloshing effects in tanks having arbitrary shapes have been studied by various authors (see, for example, [6, 11]).. "
What relationship represents the frequencies of the oscillating free surface in a circular cylindrical tank under lateral sloshing conditions?,"For lateral sloshing of a liquid propellant in a rigid circular cylindrical tank with a flat bottom, the frequencies f,, (Hz) of the oscillating free surface have been found [6, 9] to be1 hy}? @ 2 Sr= a = xed tann(e,)| where w,, (rad/s) are the angular frequencies, g (m/s?) is the vertical acceleration of the tank, ¢, are values determined from the roots of the following equation dJ\(x) =0 dx] yu,"
What denotes the radius of a circular cylindrical container in the context of liquid propellant?,"J\(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind and order, R (m) is the radius of the circular cylindrical tank, and h (m) is the height of the free surface of the quiescent liquid propellant. Values of ¢,, for the first four slosh modes are given in the following table (from [9]):"
What approximation can be made for the frequencies when the height of the liquid propellant exceeds the radius of the cylindrical container?,"Abramson et al. [9] point out that, when the height / of the liquid propellant is greater than the radius R of the circular cylindrical tank, then the equation expressing the frequencies f,, can be approximated as follows"
What is the dominant oscillation frequency associated with the root ¢; = 1.841 in the given mechanical model?,"A validation of the parameters of the equivalent mechanical model (pendulums and dashpots) illustrated in the preceding figure has been performed by Pérez et al. [10]. This linear (dashpot damping c = constant) model assumes the angles 6 of oscillation of the pendulums to be within the interval 7/12 [12).  Since the dominant sloshing frequency f; corresponds to n = 1 and therefore to the root ¢; = 1.841 of the equation J; = 0, then Pérez et al. "
What is the expression for the dominant sloshing frequency in terms of the tangential and hyperbolic tangent functions?,"have considered only one sloshing mass m, attached to a pendulum of length L,.

What is the formula for the relationship between the damping ratio and the damping factor?,"R) ~ cscht L841, (4) Dashpot damping c= 4Anfimsg where ¢ is the damping ratio, which is defined in terms of the damping factor 5 as follows 5 ¢=——__ (41? + 8°)? and the damping factor 6 is defined as follows 1 A 5=—In( k Ax where Apo (m) is the amplitude of the first wave, A; (m) is the amplitude of the kth wave, and k is the number of cycles over which the decay is measured.  The magnitude of damping in smooth-wall and in baffled-wall tanks has been determined for several shapes. "
What additional structures are necessary in circular cylindrical tanks to enhance damping and prevent instability during the storage of liquid propellants?,"Generally speaking, the amount of damping due to the wiping action of a liquid propellant against the walls of a tank is insufficient, and therefore baffles must be added to provide the damping required to prevent instability. For example, a circular cylindrical tank having ring baffles of width w along its wall is shown in the preceding figure. The damping of liquid propellants in circular cylindrical tanks without baffles has been studied by Stephens et al. "
What factors influence the damping ratio in a circular cylindrical tank as described in the provided empirical formula?,"[13]. Viscous damping of liquid propellants in tanks of various shapes has been studied by several authors. By viscous damping we mean the damping produced by interaction between the liquid propellant and the wall of the tank. An account of empirical formulae for tanks of various shapes is given in [6, 8]. For example, for a circular cylindrical tank without baffles, the damping ratio ¢ is expressed by the following experimental equation due to Mikishev and Dorozhkin [8]: 1 2 3 0.318 1—h/R ¢=0.79 8) Rig ty 4 —— EWR, p sinh(1.84h/R) Lcosh(1.84h/R) where j1/p is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid, R is the radius of the cross section of the tank, and g is the vertical acceleration. "
What is the formula for estimating the damping ratio when liquid depth exceeds twice the cross-sectional radius in a cylindrical tank with a flat ring rigid baffle?,"When the depth h of the liquid is greater than the diameter 2R of the tank cross section, then the preceding equation can be approximated as follows 1 2 3 c= o.19(4) Roight p Effective damping provided by baffles of various types has also been investigated by several authors. An account is given in [6, 8]. With reference to the preceding figure, Dodge [8] indicates the following equation, due to Miles [16], to estimate the damping ratio ¢ for a flat ring rigid baffle in a circular cylindrical tank where the liquid depth h is considerably greater than the cross-sectional radius R (h/R > 2): 1 37N\3 d = 2.83¢7(2) -4.6— ¢ i(3) exp R where C, is the ratio of the baffle area Az to the tank cross-sectional area Ay, and therefore C, is for a circular cylindrical tank c= A TR Row” _w(_ ©) Ar mt R? R R w is the width of the ring baffles, R is the radius of the cross section of the tank, 7 is the amplitude of oscillation measured at the tank wall from the free surface of the quiescent liquid, and d is the depth of the baffle below the free surface of the quiescent liquid. "
What is the maximum recommended spacing between baffles in circular cylindrical tanks relative to the tank radius?,"For circular cylindrical tanks, the damping provided by a series of  ring baffles can be calculated by superposing linearly the contribution of each baffle, when the spacing s between the baffles is greater than the width w of each baffle. For tanks of this shape, ring baffles are usually placed at a distance s < 0.2R [10]. Types of baffles studied for circular cylindrical tanks include fixed rings, rings with radial clearance, cruciform baffles, and baffles shaped as conic sections. "
What types of damping characteristics do flexible baffles exhibit in comparison to rigid baffles in specific conditions?,"Baffles have also been studied for spherical tanks and for oblate or prolate spheroidal tanks. Flexible baffles have been compared to rigid baffles, and the former have been found to provide greater damping than the latter under certain conditions [9]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [6], shows some types of ring baffles used for circular cylindrical tanks.

What effect do low gravity conditions have on the magnitude of sloshing loads in propellant tanks compared to their structural strength?,"Sloshing loads under low gravity conditions have been found small in comparison with the structural capability of propellant tanks. This topic is dealt with at length in [6, 8]."
How do the dynamic pressures caused by liquid sloshing influence the structural integrity and control mechanisms of storage tanks in aerospace applications?,"The lateral sloshing of liquid propellants in their tanks causes a distributed pressure loading on the walls. These loads are important for the structural design of the tanks. In addition, the resultant force and moment due to the distributed pressure are important for the control systems of space vehicles."
What phenomenon can arise from the interaction of longitudinal pressure modes and elastic structures in liquid propellant tanks?,"The longitudinal sloshing of liquid propellant also causes pressure loads on the tanks. These loads are less important than those due to lateral sloshing. However, the longitudinal pressure modes of a propellant may couple with those of the elastic shell or with those of the feed-line and combustion system. This fact can generate dynamic instability, as is the case with the pogo oscillations. "
What factors influence the loads on a circular cylindrical tank during sudden vertical acceleration changes?,"Loads acting on the top or on the bottom of a circular cylindrical tank can be caused by sudden changes of the net acceleration in the vertical direction. This may occur in such cases as abort just after launch, cut-off of the boost engine, engine start in orbit or in coast flight, et c. These loads are very sensitive to the test conditions and to the shapes of tanks [9]."
What factors contribute to the maximum pressure on a tank experiencing lateral sloshing?,"In case of a circular cylindrical tank subject to lateral sloshing, a simple estimate of the pressure loads can be done by considering the tank pressurisation po, the static pressure pgz due to the liquid propellant in the tank, and the pressure due to the lateral sloshing at its lowest natural frequency f; = w,/(27:), corresponding to the first mode of oscillation. In other words, the maximum pressure Pmax (N/m?) on a tank subject to lateral sloshing occurs in the plane of oscillation and can be expressed by using the following equation of [9]:. "
Define the variables that represent the vertical acceleration of the tank and the maximum height above the liquid surface in a slosh dynamics context.,"cosh[1.841(452)] Pmax = Po + p8z+ Pen osh[ 8412] sin(@)t) where p (kg/m?) is the density of the liquid propellant in the operational conditions, g (m/s?) is the vertical acceleration of the tank, 7 (m) is the maximum height above the free surface of the quiescent liquid at the wall, R (m) is the radius of the tank, (m) is the height of the free surface of the quiescent liquid, z (m) is the distance from the free surface of the quiescent liquid to any arbitrary depth (positive downward), and q@, (rad/s) is the first natural angular frequency of lateral slosh, whose value has been found above to be 1 = [neste em(1serg) | @, = | 1.841= tanh{ 1.841— R R. "
What is the relationship between the total vertical acceleration acting on a particle of the free surface and the conditions leading to turbulent sloshing?,"Abramson et al. [9] point out that the total vertical acceleration acting on a particle of the free surface varies between g—n wi and g + 1 @; at the wall of the tank. When the amplitude of the sloshing propellant becomes large enough for the total vertical acceleration to be instantaneously zero, then the sloshing wave breaks up, and turbulent sloshing begins. Taking this condition as an upper limit yields n = g/o, and therefore the equation expressing the maximum pressure can be re-written as follows. "
What occurs to the liquid propellant's oscillations when the height of the free surface is approximately equivalent to or exceeds the tank's radius?,"R cosh[1.841(452)] Prox = Pot rs * [841 sinb[ 1.8414]When the height h of the free surface is roughly equal to or greater than the radius R of the tank, the oscillations of the liquid propellant become independent of h, and the equation expressing the maximum pressure can be approximated as follows [9]:"
What is the method to estimate maximum pressure in tanks with non-flat bottom surfaces?,"This equation still holds approximately in cases of tanks whose bottom surfaces are not flat. In case of non-cylindrical tanks, the maximum pressure can be expressed by using other formulae, for example, those of [6, 8], or [11]."
What effect does dividing a tank into compartments have on the sloshing mass in lower modes of oscillation?,"Generally speaking, one third of the liquid propellant, the part of it which is near the bottom of the tank, is not affected by sloshing, which occurs near the free surface. The equivalent mechanical models consisting of fixed masses and oscillating masses are based on this fact. The sloshing mass and the resultant force decrease considerably in the higher modes of oscillations. For the lower modes, the sloshing mass can be reduced by dividing a tank into radial or concentric compartments. Some typical configurations used for propellant tanks are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [6].. "
What type of tank design features a circular shape and is typically used in various clustered configurations?,"Circular tank Clustered tanks Scalloped tank (Redstone, Jupiter) (Saturn !) Sector ~- compartmented tank Annular tank Tri - tanks (Saturn V) (Titan ft)"
How does dividing a cylindrical tank into radial sectors impact the separation of slosh frequencies for the fundamental and second modes?,"On the effectiveness of dividing a tank into compartments for the purpose of reducing the sloshing mass, Dodge [8] notes that, for a circular cylindrical tank, the division into radial sectors raises the first (or fundamental) slosh frequency and lowers the second, so that the two modes are less separated in frequency. In addition, radial compartments are less effective than ring baffles in reducing the amplitude of forces and moments due to sloshing [8].. "
What method can be used to estimate the pressure in a circular cylindrical tank during sloshing at the first longitudinal angular frequency?,"When a liquid propellant sloshes in a longitudinal mode, the pressures integrated over the bottom and the walls of the tank have a zero resultant force. An estimate of the pressure p (N/m?) during sloshing ina circular cylindrical tank at the first longitudinal angular frequency w, (rad/s) can be done by using the following formula of [9]:"
What is the value of P in the given expression when 3.83 is used in both the hyperbolic cosine and tangent functions?,"Jo(3.83£) cosh[3.83(422)] P= Pot rs +17,G.83) cosh[aaaay er)  where 1 = [sssetmn(ssee) | @, = | 3.83= tanh{ 3.83— R R"
What becomes of the maximum pressure when the height of the free surface is equivalent to or exceeds the radius of the tank?,"Hopfinger and Baumbach [14] is the first of the natural angular frequencies of longitudinal slosh, r (m) is the radial co-ordinate, and J (x) is the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind.When the height h of the free surface is roughly equal to or greater than the radius R of the tank, assuming again n = g/a;, the maximum pressure becomes"
How does the presence of an elastic bottom in a tank influence the natural frequencies of the liquid's surface compared to a rigid tank?,Abramson et al. [9] also point out that the effect of an elastic tank bottom is to lower the natural sloshing frequencies of the free surface slightly below their values in a rigid tank.
What effect does a change in direction of resultant acceleration have on liquid propellant in a tank during engine shutdown or ignition?,"Longitudinal accelerations impressed to a partially filled tank can cause a liquid propellant to impinge on the dome of the tank. The problem of dome impact arises when the resultant acceleration acting on the tank reverses its direction. This may occur during engine shutdown of a launch vehicle flying through the atmosphere, or when an engine is ignited while the propellant is located in the upper part of a tank [6]. "
What kind of pressure must be considered for evaluating the strength of a tank during specific events?,"The impulsive pressure resulting from one of such events must be taken into account when assessing the structural integrity of a tank. This problem is considered at length in [6]. The impact of a liquid propellant on deflector baffles may also produce considerable loads. There being no general methods of analysis for predicting such loads, empirical methods or tests or both are used for this purpose. Ring baffles and other internal devices can reduce fluid impact loads [9].. "
What is the formula for determining the peak force exerted on a submerged barrier caused by oscillating fluid motion?,"The maximum pressure p (N/m’) acting on a submerged baffle of width w (m), subject to an oscillating velocity U = U,, cos(wt) (m/s), due a liquid propellant sloshing at an angular frequency w (rad/s), is given by the following equation of [9]:"
"What is the relationship expressed by the equation p equals K multiplied by U, where K represents a non-dimensional parameter?","p=KpU,, where K is a non-dimensional parameter whose values are given in the following figure of [9, 15]  8 6 o & a $4 LJ 4 2 it) = 0 20 40 60 30 100 120 TU, /@w and p (kg/m) and U,,, (m/s) are respectively the density and the maximum velocity of the liquid propellant in the operating conditions."
What is the formula for maximum vertical velocity of sloshing liquid at a specified depth in a circular cylindrical tank?,"The maximum vertical velocity U,, (m/s) of the sloshing liquid at any distance z (m), positive downward, from the free surface of the quiescent liquid to any arbitrary depth in a circular cylindrical tank is given by the following equation of [9]:"

"
What is the relationship between pressure on the baffle and the square of the velocity of the sloshing liquid propellant?,"By using these equation and assuming the height h of the propellant to be equal to or greater than the radius R of the tank, the equation p = KpU2, which expresses the pressure on the baffle due to the sloshing liquid propellant, can be approximated as follows [9]:"
What is the expression for maximum pressure on a ring baffle located at a specified depth below the surface?,"_ 22 z p= Kpwjn exp —3.6825 After setting again 1 = g/w?, the maximum pressure on a ring baffle placed at the depth z from the free surface can be expressed as follows KpgR ( Zz = BE"" exp(—3.682=) P= Tear OP R "
How does perforating a baffle influence the pressure acting on it and what balance is affected by the changes in damping and area?,"The pressure acting on a ring baffle can be reduced by perforating the ring baffle with small holes. This is because the oscillating flow through the holes is an additional source of damping. However, this increased damping is partially offset by a decrease in the effective area of a perforated baffle [8]."
How is the pressure experienced by a ring baffle influenced by sloshing waves over a stationary liquid propellant?,"A ring baffle, which is just above the free surface of a quiescent liquid propellant, is periodically subject to the slapping action of the sloshing wave. In this case, the pressure acting on the baffle is expressed by the following equation of [9]:"
How can maximum pressure be determined when sloshing loads are considered for ring-type baffles?,"p =2pU,, where U,,, is the velocity of the liquid propellant at impact with the baffle. By setting U,, = @; 7; and substituting in the preceding equation, there results p = 2paintBy setting again n| = g/w? and assuming h > R, the maximum pressure on theThe methods discussed above have shown how to compute sloshing loads on baffles of the ring type."
What factors must be determined to apply the equation for maximum pressure on a baffle when using various baffle types?,"When baffles of other types, such as anti-vortex baffles and truss-type baffles, are used, then it is still possible to use the preceding equation p = KpU2, which expresses the maximum pressure on the baffle, but it is also necessary to determine the value of K and the value of U,, which apply to the case of interest. Keulegan and Carpenter [15] gives values of K for oscillatory flow around cylinders and plates.. "
What is the relationship between the natural period of oscillation and the non-dimensional parameter used in evaluating lateral sloshing in a cylindrical tank?,"Such values depend on the baffle shape and on the non-dimensional parameter U,»T/(2w), where T is the natural period of oscillation. This parameter, in turn, requires the evaluation of U,,,. For this purpose, in case of a liquid propellant sloshing laterally in a circular cylindrical tank at its first angular frequency @, the radial component u, and the tangential component ug of the velocity vector u of the liquid propellant can be computed by using the following equations, due to Bauer [17], taken from [9]:.

"
What types of devices are commonly utilized for reducing fluid motion in tanks?,"The present section describes some devices used for slosh damping. Those of them which have been most frequently used for this purpose are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [7]. (ers) Cruciform baffle (perforated) in spherical tank Flat-ring baffles in evlindrical tank Flat ring Truncated cone (perforated) Fiat ring with lip Flexible baffle . "
What are the different types of devices used to minimize sloshing effects and protect tank structures?,"Such devices are used not only to reduce sloshing loads, but also to protect tank bulkheads from impact loads caused by non-periodic motion of liquid propellants. As has been shown in Sect. 6.5, the sloshing mass m, of a liquid propellant, that is, the part of the total mass which moves during sloshing, can also be reduced by using tanks of appropriate shapes or divided into compartments. According to [7], slosh- suppression devices include rigid-ring baffles, cruciform baffles, deflectors, flexible flat-ring baffles, floating cans, and positive-expulsion bags or diaphragms. A brief description of them is given below.. "
What is the purpose of installing baffles in a tank besides slosh damping?,"The most frequently used manner of providing slosh damping in a tank is to install baffles in the tank. Such baffles are placed in points which are slightly below the level of the free surface of the liquid propellant at the times in which damping is required. The baffles can be installed either for the sole purpose of providing slosh damping in a tank, or also for structural reasons, to be used as wall-stiffener rings. In the latter case, their size is increased to provide the required damping.. "
What formula is used to express the damping ratio for slosh suppression in circular cylindrical tanks?,"Rigid-ring baffles are widely used as slosh-suppression devices. As has been shown in Sect. 6.5, the damping ratio ¢ provided by rigid-ring baffles in circular cylindrical tanks is expressed by the Miles formula [16] as follows"
What condition must be met regarding the liquid depth compared to the tank's cross-sectional radius for the specified behavior to hold?,"R R R R which holds when the depth / of the liquid propellant is considerably greater than the cross-sectional radius R of the tank (h/R > 2). In the preceding formula, w is the width of the rigid-ring baffles, 7 is the amplitude of oscillation measured at the tank wall from the free surface of the quiescent liquid, and d is the depth of the baffle below the free surface of the quiescent liquid. This formula is based on the assumption that the baffle is completely submerged during a slosh cycle.. "
What method can be utilized to calculate damping ratios for flat-ring baffles in tanks with greater spacing than the width of each baffle?,"A series of flat-ring baffles is the most frequently used slosh-suppression device in circular cylindrical tanks. As has been shown in Sect. 6.5, damping ratios for a series of flat-ring baffles can be calculated by using the principle of linear superposition, when the spacing s between the baffles is greater than the width w of each baffle [10]."
What types of tank shapes have been subject to damping studies by various authors besides circular cylinders?,"Damping provided by baffles in tanks of other shapes than circular cylinders has also been studied by several authors. An account of such studies is given in [6, 8] for spherical, oblate and prolate spheroidal, and toroidal tanks. An experimental investigation was conducted by Sumner [18] to determine the slosh-suppression effectiveness of rigid and flexible flat-plate annular-ring baffles in spherical tanks subject to oscillations in the horizontal plane. "
What ratio of baffle width to tank radius was identified as optimal for minimizing slosh forces in spherical tanks?,"The baffles caused a variation in the fundamental frequency of oscillation, and were found most effective in reducing the slosh forces and increasing the damping when the free surface of the quiescent liquid was slightly above the baffle, so that the latter remained submerged during the oscillatory cycle of the liquid. The optimum baffle width to tank radius ratio was found to be w/R = 0.125 for the spherical tanks considered. "
What configurations are depicted in the side view of the internal structures within spherical tanks?,"A side view of the baffles in the spherical tanks is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [18].  7 PNY Single-ring baffle Three-ring baffle. "
What effect do ring baffles have on effective damping when positioned near the equilibrium surface in a specially shaped tank?,"Stephens et al. [19] conducted an experimental investigation of the damping of liquid oscillations in an oblate spheroidal tank. The decay of the fundamental mode was studied for a range of liquid depths in tanks with and without baffles. The results indicate that the addition of ring baffles to the tank results in an increase in the available effective damping when the baffle plane is in a region near the equilibrium liquid surface, and that cruciform baffles are effective in the damping of the fundamental mode in the near-empty tank [19].. "
What benefits can flexible-ring baffles provide compared to rigid-ring baffles in terms of damping effectiveness and mass?,"As has been anticipated in Sect. 6.5, flexible-ring baffles can offer substantial advantages, upon certain conditions, over rigid-ring baffles. Such advantages concern higher damping effectiveness and lower mass. An experimental study conducted by Stephens and Scholl [20] for large-scale cylindrical tanks fitted with both flexible and rigid annular ring baffles has shown that slosh damping comparable to that provided by rigid baffles can be obtained by using smaller and less massive flexible baffles. "
"What are the three non-dimensional parameters that characterize sloshing liquid, baffle flexibility, and damping?","Stephens and Scholl have shown that the characteristics of the sloshing liquid, the flexibility of the baffles, and the damping can specified by three non-dimensional parameters. These parameters are: (1) the period parameter P, which describes the velocity of the liquid in the vicinity of the baffle; (2) the flexibility parameter F, which defines the deflection of the baffle per unit loading; and (3) the relative damping parameter 5/5,, which is the ratio of the damping factor 6 provided by the flexible baffle to the damping factor 6, provided by a rigid baffle of the same width w and under the same flow conditions as those of the flexible baffle.. "

How does the damping factor of a flexible baffle compare to that of a rigid baffle under similar oscillatory flow conditions?,"e the damping factor 5 provided by a flexible baffle is comparable to or greater than the damping factor 6, provided by a rigid baffle in the same conditions of oscillatory flow;"
How does increasing the flexibility parameter affect the relative damping parameter in relation to the period parameter?,"e the efficiency of damping per unit of weight of a flexible baffle may greatly exceed that of a rigid baffle;e asa baffle becomes more flexible (that is, for increasing values of the flexibility parameter F), the relative damping parameter 5/5, also increases and reaches a maximum value, which depends on the value of the period parameter P; and"
What happens to the relative damping parameter as the flexibility parameter increases significantly in a flow system with cruciform baffles?,"e as the flexibility parameter increases further, the relative damping parameter 4/65, decreases rapidly to the point at which the baffle opposes no resistance to the flow.

"What type of baffles offers less damping in cylindrical tanks compared to another configuration, specifically mentioned in relation to their effectiveness?","arrangement makes the damping provided by these baffles in cylindrical tanks inde-pendent of the liquid height.

What types of baffles are utilized in the tank design to enhance stability and minimize fluid movement?,"The tank illustrated in the two preceding figures has ring baffles attached to the skin stiffeners, which stabilise the tank wall and reduce sloshing. This tank has also a cruciform baffle and anti-vortex baffles (the latter just above the sump) at its base."
What shape are the devices used to suppress liquid motions above the surface of a propellant?,"Deflectors have been placed above the surface of a liquid propellant in order to suppress the large-amplitude liquid motions which may be excited by an engine cut- off or by the pulsing of attitude-control engines during orbital coast. Deflectors are shaped as wide, inverted conical-ring baffles. They prevent liquid propellant from reaching the tank vent, and facilitate propellant drainage. They also contribute, when submerged, to damp oscillatory motions [7].. "
What are the two types of devices evaluated to manage the surface of liquid propellants in storage tanks?,"Rigid lids, floating cans or porous mats have also been studied for propellant tanks. Such devices always act at the free surface of a liquid propellant. Rigid lids which cover part of the free surface of a liquid propellant and float up or down as the level changes in the tank have been found effective when they cover 85% or more of the tank diameter [8]. Floating porous mats have also been evaluated for the purpose of increasing viscous effects at the surface.

What devices are utilized to ensure an impermeable barrier between liquid and gas in tanks during low-gravity liquid propellant transfer?,"Positive-expulsion bags and diaphragms of elastomeric materials are used in tanks when it is necessary to transfer liquid propellants in low-gravity conditions or when a large flow rate is desired in rocket engines fed without pumps, as has been shown in Chap. 3, Sect. 3.5. These devices provide an impermeable barrier between the liquid and the gas contained in a tank. For this purpose, a membrane of elastomeric material or a flexible metallic diaphragm is attached around the wall of a tank at some section, as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [8].  Membrane ; aw we Attachment Liquid propellant point. "
What is the requirement for the membrane size in relation to the initial liquid quantity and remaining liquid expulsion?,"The size of the membrane must be large enough to contain the initial quantity of liquid, and to expel nearly all the liquid which remains near the bottom of the tank."
What relationship was observed between excitation amplitude and maximum slosh forces during the experiments with spherical tanks?,Stofan and Sumner [24] conducted an experimental investigation to evaluate the slosh-damping effectiveness of positive-expulsion bags and diaphragms in spherical tanks ranging from 0.2413 to 0.8128 m in diameter. The positive-expulsion devices tested were made of buty! rubber and ranged from 0.254 to 1.016 mm in thickness. The excitation was impressed to the tank in the horizontal plane. The maximum slosh forces occurring at the first natural frequency increased with an increase in excitation amplitude and decreased as the thickness of the diaphragm material increased. 
What effect does increasing the diaphragm material thickness have on the damping factor in slosh-suppression devices?,"The damping factor 6 was found to be essentially independent of the excitation amplitude and increased with an increase in the thickness of the diaphragm material. The second natural mode force peak and the fluid swirl at the natural mode frequencies, which were observed for the unrestricted liquid sloshing, were completely suppressed [23]. This type of slosh-suppression device has prevalently been used for spherical or oblate spheroidal tanks [8]. 6.7 Materials, Processes, and Environmental Conditions. "
What factors should be evaluated when selecting metallic materials for specific applications?,The properties of the metallic materials to be considered in the evaluation and selec- tion phases of a given programme have been identified by Wagner and Keller [22] as follows: © strength/weight efficiency under load/temperature conditions or under other critical failure conditions;e capability of being fabricated into the desired shapes and sizes without loss of their properties;
What is the significance of ensuring functionality across various expected conditions in a technical system?,© compatibility with all anticipated environments;
What factors influence the selection of materials concerning their durability against flaw growth and the variety of shapes available?,e fracture toughness and resistance to subcritical flaw growth;e availability of shapes and sizes within required schedules; and© costs of materials and material processing and fabrication.
What material properties are essential for designing tanks in rocket vehicles to prevent yielding and ensure safety under various load conditions?,"These properties are discussed below. The principal strength properties to be considered in the design of tanks for rocket vehicles are ultimate tensile strength (F,), which governs ultimate burst pressure under ductile failure conditions; tensile yield strength (Fy), to comply with the requirement of no yielding at limit load conditions or during proof testing; compressive yield strength (Fy), for compression- critical structures; and the elastic properties (E, G, and v) of the materials. "
What types of fatigue data are typically used to assess the impact of structural vibrations and pressurisation cycles?,"Further properties are ultimate shear strength (F,,,), ultimate bearing strength (F;,,,,), and bearing yield strength (F;,y), which apply to design details, such as mechanical attachments, and are not usually important factors in the selection of materials. High- frequency, low-stress fatigue data are sometimes required to evaluate the effects of structural vibrations. Low-frequency, high-stress fatigue data are often used to evaluate the effects of multiple pressurisation cycles.. "
What factors can influence the mechanical characteristics of tank materials?,"Wagner and Keller [22] have also identified some variable parameters which can affect the mechanical properties of the materials used for tanks. These parameters are temperature, thermal exposure, duration of loading, presence of biaxial and triaxial loads, rate of loading, and unusual environmental conditions such as corrosion and radiation."
What factors should be assessed when evaluating the design properties of materials related to the base metal and weld zones?,"The design properties of the materials are to be evaluated for the base metal, for the welds, and sometimes also for the weld zones exposed to heat. It is also necessary to consider the loading direction with respect to the grain orientation of the base metal, and the properties of the materials along and across the direction of the weld. The effects induced on the properties of the materials by processing, forming, and heat treatments are also to be considered.. "
What military standards address the materials used for the structures of aerospace vehicles?,The metallic materials used for structures of aerospace vehicles form the subject of the military standards MIL-HDBK-SJ [25]. The welds form the subject of [26].
"How does a reduction in thermal levels affect the properties of materials used in cryogenic tanks regarding their strength, ductility, and fracture toughness?","A decrease in temperature tends to increase the strength of the material, but often decreases their ductility and toughness. In case of tanks containing cryogenic propellants, an increase in strength at low temperature is desirable, because it results in a mass reduction; however, it is also necessary in this case to ascertain whether the fracture toughness of the material of which the tank is made is adequate to the operational and proof-testing conditions.. "
How does prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures affect the mechanical properties of certain titanium alloys?,"Likewise, an increase in temperature tends to reduce the strength of the materials. This fact is to be considered for materials which are particularly sensitive to temper- ature, as is the case with some titanium alloys. Exposure of such materials to high temperatures for long periods of time can cause a permanent reduction in strength. "
What failure type can occur in tanks due to repeated pressurization cycles during both testing and operational service?,Tanks for fluid propellants are required to withstand a high number (sometimes of the order of one hundred) of pressurisation cycles. Such cycles occur in testing and of course in service. Thank failures due to fatigue can occur as a result of these repeated cycles.
"What is the term for the time-dependent deformation of materials when subjected to sustained stresses, especially at elevated temperatures?","Pressurisation stresses in tanks can also cause creep, which is a time-dependent deformation of a material subject to prolonged stresses. Creep usually occurs at high temperatures, but can also occur at moderately high temperatures for some titanium or aluminium alloys."
"How do bi-axial tensile stresses influence the mechanical performance of ductile, homogeneous, and isotropic materials?","The multi-axial loading of metals can have significant effects on their mechanical properties. The bi-axial tensile stresses acting in pressurised tanks may in some cases improve, in other cases leave unchanged, and in other cases deteriorate the perfor- mance of the materials. Materials which are ductile, homogeneous, and isotropic may show an increase in tensile strength, the amount of this increase depending on the bi-axial stress ratio. The maximum effects usually occurs at a bi-axial tensile-stress ratio of 2:1.. "
What is the effective stress for yielding in a material element subjected to multi-axial loading based on the von Mises criterion?,"As shown by experience, the magnitude of this effect is often of the order of that predicted by the von Mises criterion [27]. According to this criterion, the effective stress for yielding og in a material element subject to multi-axial loading is"
What is the mathematical representation for the sum of the squares of the principal stresses acting on three mutually perpendicular planes without shear stress?,"[* = 02)” + (62 — 03)"" + (03 — aa Sef f= | oo? 2 where 01, 02, and 3 are the principal stresses, that is, the stresses acting along three mutually orthogonal planes of zero shear stresses (tT 2 = T23 = 73, = 0)."
"Which yield criteria are applicable for materials that exhibit different properties in various directions, specifically those not adhering to the von Mises criterion?","Anisotropic materials do not conform to the von Mises criterion. Such is the case, for example, with titanium processed in such a way as to obtain preferred orientations of the individual crystals or grains. For such materials, other yield criteria can be used, for example, the Hill 1948 criterion [28]. Further information on the Hill 1948 and other criteria for anisotropic materials can be found in [29]. "
"What behavior do some homogeneous and isotropic alloys exhibit that differs from the von Mises criterion, according to Wagner and Keller?","In addition, Wagner and Keller [22] point out that some homogeneous and isotropic alloys do not appear to behave in full accordance with the von Mises criterion. . "
What effect does biaxial tension have on low-elongation materials in terms of their ductility and brittleness?,"The strength of some materials may decrease when they are subject to biaxial tension. This effect may occur with low-elongation materials in a biaxial tensile- stress field. This state of stress is typical of spherical tanks, and limits the ductility of the material to the plane which includes its thickness. In other planes, such materials in this state of stress tend to behave in a brittle manner [22].. "
What quality of materials is crucial for shaping them into specific dimensions while maintaining their properties in aerospace tank design?,"The capability possessed by a material of being fabricated into the desired shapes and sizes without loss of its properties is one of the principal qualities considered in the design of tanks for aerospace vehicles. This is because not all high-strength materials can also be manufactured economically to form tanks having the desired characteristics. Some essential fabrication requirements, indicated by Wagner and Keller [22], are indicated below:. "
"What factors must be considered regarding material adaptability for specific configurations, assembly methods, and thermal treatment processes?","e availability in suitable forms, sizes, and levels of quality within the necessary schedules;e capability of being formed, and machined to the required configurations, on the available equipment, and at the appropriate thicknesses and strength level;© capability of being welded to suit the common methods of assembly; and¢ capability of meeting thermal processing requirements."
"What factors should a designer consider when selecting a fabrication method for a tank, according to the suggestions provided by Whitfield and Keller?",Some guidelines to be followed by a designer to choose a method of fabrication for a tank have been suggested by Whitfield and Keller [30]. A brief account is given below.
"What factors should be evaluated when selecting a fabrication method for a rocket engine tank to ensure reliability, cost-effectiveness, and timely production?","The method of fabrication chosen for a tank of a rocket engine should be reliable, rapid, and cost-effective for the particular case and needs of the programme to which it applies. A fabrication process should be selected so as to afford the best compro- mise between fabrication schedule and cost, without reducing reliability below a desired level. An engineering study should include trade-off evaluations of fabrica- tion and welding processes, reliability of various processes based on past experience, schedule effects of material processing, and cost connected with fabrication, tools, and facilities..

What method allows for very large sizes but is limited to cold forming?,"A comparison of methods of fabrication used for pressure-vessel components is shown in the following table, taken from [22].

"What factors influence the selection of a material, fabrication method, and heat treatment for a component?","The size and the shape of a component and the aptitude of its material to be formed and machined are important aspects in choosing a material, a method of fabrication, and a heat treatment. For example, the large size of a component limits the methods of fabrication and the heat treatments which can be chosen."
Identify three types of materials mentioned in the references related to the subject matter.,"Specific information on the matter can be found in [31] (titanium and its alloys), [32] (stainless steel), and [33] (precipitation-hardening stainless steel)."
What key properties should a metal possess to ensure effective welding for applications involving tanks?,"The welding properties of a metal are of paramount importance in the choice of a metal for a tank. Desirable properties for a weldable metal are its capability of being fused without the formation of unwanted phases or constituents in or near the fusion zone, its ductility in the range from the melting temperature to room temperature (in order to resist cracking), strength, and fracture-resistance.. "
"What welding method is commonly utilized for rapidly joining mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum in aerospace applications?","Generally speaking, according to NASA [34], the welding processes used for space flight hardware are: © Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW also known as MIG Welding), which is used for quickly fusing mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminium of various thicknesses;"

What technology is utilized to sever steel and various metals of different thicknesses in construction and maintenance tasks?,"e Plasma Cutting, which is used to cut steel and other metals of different thicknesses for metal construction and maintenance."
"What method, utilized for joining materials in liquid-propellant rocket engine tanks, employs a rotating tool and a backing surface for solid-state bonding?","A further process, used specifically for tanks of liquid-propellant rocket engines, is Friction Stir Welding (FSW), whose working principle is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [35].[- Plunge Force }4— Rotation Travel pa Pin Tool ¢— Workpiece Backing Anvil"
"What welding technique combines frictional heating and mechanical stirring to create strong, defect-free joints in materials?","This welding process uses frictional heating combined with forging pressure to produce high-strength bonds virtually free of defects. Friction Stir Welding trans- forms the metals from a solid state into a plastic-like state, and then mechanically stirs the materials together under pressure to form a welded joint. This process was invented and patented by The Welding Institute (a British research and technology organisation), and has been applied to aerospace, shipbuilding, aircraft, and auto- motive industries. In particular, it has been used primarily for square butt welds in aluminium alloys of the 2XXX series.. "
Which aerospace projects have utilized Friction Stir Welding as indicated in previous studies?,"Carter [35] has given some examples of application of Friction Stir Welding to the aerospace industry. They are e Space Shuttle external tank;e United Launch Alliance Delta II, Delta IV, and Atlas V; e@ Space X Falcon and Falcon 9; e Japan—JAXA H-IIB; and  e NASA—Space Launch System core stage."
What are the three process variables that need to be managed in the technique mentioned in the context?,"One of the principal benefits of this technology is that it allows welds to be made on aluminium alloys which cannot be readily welded by fusion arc. An example of such alloys is the AI-Li 2195 alloy, which has been used for the Super Light Weight Tank of the Space Shuttle. A further benefit of Friction Stir Welding is that it has fewer elements than other welding techniques to control. In Friction Stir Welding there are only three process variables to control, namely, rotation speed, travel speed, and pressure, all of which are easily controlled. "
What effect did the enhancement in joint strength and decreased process variability have on the external tank's safety and reliability?,The increase in joint strength combined with the reduction in process variability resulted in an increased margin of safety and in a high degree of reliability for the external tank of the Space Shuttle.. 
What is the range of angular velocity for the dowel in Friction Stir Welding?,"In Friction Stir Welding, a dowel rotates at an angular velocity between 19 and 31 rad/s [36], depending on the thickness of the material. The pin tip of the dowel is forced into the material under a pressure going from 3.4 x 107 to 6.9 x 107 N/m? [36]. The pin continues to rotate and moves forward at a speed going from 1.48 to 2.12 mm/s [36]. As the pin rotates, friction heats the surrounding material and rapidly produces a softened plasticised area under the pin. "
"At what temperature does material typically begin to liquefy, preventing excessive friction?","Plasticity starts to occur around 700 K for most materials [37]. The temperature due to friction is carefully controlled not to exceed the point of turning the material to a liquid, which occurs at about 922 K in most cases [37]. As the pin travels forward, the material behind the pin is forged under pressure from the dowel and consolidates to form a bond at a molecular level.. "
What process involves a retractable pin tool that allows for adjustments in thickness without melting the base material?,"Unlike fusion welding, no actual melting occurs in this process, and the weld is left in the same fine-grained condition as the original metal. For the external tank of the Space Shuttle, a through-spindle retractable pin was developed, which can retract or expand its pin tip within the material. This allows for changes of thickness such as on the longitudinal barrel of the tank [36]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [37], shows retractable pin tools used for the Friction Stir Welding process.. "
What welding tool was designed to eliminate a weakness created by a keyhole in the welding process?,"Retractable pin tools were developed by NASA engineers because the original Friction Stir Welding left a opening, known as a keyhole, which was a point of weakness in the weld. The retractable pin tool retracts automatically when the weld  is complete and prevents a keyhole. This improvement makes the weld stronger and eliminates the need to fill the keyhole during manufacturing."
"What processing methods may be necessary for high-carbon, low-alloy steel welds thicker than 2.5 mm to prevent cracking?","Apart from the choice of a particular welding technique, further processing, such as pre-heat or post-heat or both of them, is generally required for high-carbon, low- alloy steel welds when thickness is higher than 2.5 mm. However, pre-heat and post-heat may be required for welds of thickness equal to or less than 2.5 mm, in order to avoid weld cracking, depending on the material, on the welding process, and on the restraint characteristics of the particular weld. "
What types of materials are utilized for backup tools to manage heat dissipation and influence the properties of a weld?,"When pre-heat or post- heat is performed by using a torch, then oxidation can reduce the quality of the weld. To avoid this, automatic electric heating is desirable in many cases, because electric heaters controlled by rheostats provide appropriate temperatures and uniform heating. Backup tools made of copper, stainless steel, or refractory-covered metals are used to achieve either high, or low, or negligible heat dissipation, as the case requires, to control the final dimensions and properties of the weld [30]. "
How can reduced metal strength in welding areas be addressed in structural design?,"A reduced strength of a metal in or near the welding zone can be compensated for by increasing its thickness at the joints. Since ductility decreases in the welding zone, then welds are generally located away from high-stress zones. Such zones are those in which a parallel or a meridian of a surface of revolution changes abruptly its radius of curvature.. "
"What methods can minimize residual stresses in welded materials, particularly for applications involving tanks?","Residual stresses can still be present in welded zones, unless appropriate steps are taken. For this purpose, such processes as pressure welding and forge welding can reduce residual stresses to minimum values. Residual stresses should be relieved from materials used for tanks to avoid cracking, warping, and reduction of resistance to fatigue and fracture. To this end, such thermal processes as ageing for titanium and heat treatment for steel are applied. "
What is the purpose of aging after welding in certain types of maraging steel?,"For example, the 18%-nickel maraging steel (so called because its strengthening mechanism consists in transforming the alloy to martensite with subsequent age hardening) requires ageing after welding to acquire maximum mechanical properties in welds [22]. Annealing is sometimes required before or during forming of tank components. However, many of the mate- rials commonly used for tanks do not require heat treatments after welding, either to restore mechanical properties or to relieve residual stresses.. "
What effects can hydrogen embrittlement have on steel in terms of fracture under specific loading conditions?,"The materials which are chosen for tanks of liquid-propellant rocket engines must be compatible with the propellants contained. The following table, due to the courtesy of NASA [22], shows causes and effects of reactions of metals with fluids.  Major sources of metal/fluid Possible consequences reaction to system ate te |o| Metal corrosion (1) Metal weakening through x x x | (including general loss in cross-sectional | corrosion, pitting, area and introduction intergranular corrosion, of stress raisers | and chemical attack) (2) System contamination with corrosion products | Catalytic decomposition Loss of efficiency or contamin- x of propellants ation of system or both Hydrogen embrittlement Brittle fracture at low of steel stresses, especially under long-duration loading Contamination of titanium | Brittle fracture at low stresses | xi foe fm | x Stress corrosion Metal crack growth or fracture at reduced stress levels Galvanic corrosion (1) Rapid deterioration of material (2)  Stress-corrosion failure. "
What factors must be considered regarding metals used in tanks to prevent degradation from various external conditions?,Hydrogen-environment Embrittled behavior of metal whileA = manufacturing fluids and processes B = proof and system testingThe metallic materials used for tanks should be considered alone or in combination with suitable types of protective finish. Such materials should also be resistant to the effects of exposure to all possible types of external environment.
"What methods can be implemented to safeguard metals from adverse effects during their various stages such as processing, manufacturing, and storage?","It is also necessary to prevent the deterioration or the contamination of metals used for tanks during their processing, manufacturing, inspection, test, transportation, and storage [22]. For this purpose, they must be protected from all fluids or processes which might have deleterious effects, as shown in the preceding table."
What can occur to high-strength alloys due to reactions from certain fluids and treatments during manufacturing?,"In particular, many high-strength alloys may be to attacked or contaminated by fluids and treatments commonly used in the phases of manufacturing and process. This is because some fluids or treatments have given rise to undesirable chemical reactions, and must therefore be carefully checked before being used."
What types of contamination can affect titanium-based alloys during their manufacturing process for rocket tanks?,"Of the alloys commonly used for rocket tanks, those based on titanium have been found to be the most susceptible to contamination. Examples of contamination of such alloys in the manufacturing phase are "
What types of contamination can occur due to halide materials before high-temperature processes?,"e hydrogen contamination at room temperature or at high temperatures;e oxygen and nitrogen contamination at high temperatures; ande halogen contamination, resulting from halide-containing materials, before heat treatment or welding."
What effect does contamination by certain gases have on the brittleness of titanium and its alloys during welding and heat treatments?,"Titanium contaminated by hydrogen or oxygen or nitrogen becomes brittle. This undesirable effect, when due to heat treatments in air, can sometimes be removed by machining. However, when a titanium alloy is welded in air, then the entire weld becomes brittle."
How does the strength of steel influence its vulnerability to hydrogen contamination during electrolytic processes?,Steel can also become brittle when contaminated by hydrogen. This happens typi- cally in electrolytic processes. Steel becomes increasingly susceptible to contamina- tion due to hydrogen as its strength increases.
What factors influence the brittleness of certain alloys used in rocket tanks when exposed to hydrogen?,"Other type of alloys used for rocket tanks (such as aluminium alloys and alloys based on nickel and cobalt) may, or may not, become brittle in various degrees when contaminated by hydrogen, depending on temperature [22]."
What are the potential effects of chemical reactions between fluids and tank materials in rocket technology?,"Fluids contained in rocket tanks can cause chemical reactions which results in either corrosion or reduced strength of the materials of which the tanks are made. This holds with both testing fluids and propellants. Fluids commonly used for testing purposes are not dangerous by their nature, but may become dangerous as a result of contamination. Examples are tanks made of titanium alloys pressurised with methanol, or made of steel pressurised with water [22].. "
What conditions must be replicated to test a material's resistance to chemical attack from a specific propellant?,"Some propellants are corrosive or chemically reactive. The containment of these propellants in tanks made of materials sensitive to chemical reactions is possible only when a film or a layer of stable oxide protects the covered material from further reactions. In order to test the susceptibility of a given material to possible chemical attach due to a given propellant, it is necessary to conduct tests in the same conditions of pressure, temperature, and duration of exposure as those which will be experienced by the material in service.. "
What are two examples of propellants that can undergo accelerated decomposition due to metal catalysis?,The decomposition of some propellants may be accelerated by the catalysing action exerted by some metals. Examples of propellants subject to catalytic decomposition are hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine.
What factors can contribute to the corrosion of a tank's external surface during its life cycle?,"A tank whose external surface is exposed to atmospheric agents during part of the life of a space vehicle is subject to moisture, salts, and chemical substances of industrial origin. This part includes the times of manufacturing, storage, testing, transportation, and operation. Some metals used for tanks are resistant to atmospheric corrosion, because of the formation of a thin layer of protective oxide. "
What types of alloys and steels require a protective coating to enhance their durability and resistance?,"Such is the case with titanium alloys, stainless steels and super-alloys having high percentages of nickel and chromium, and some aluminium alloys. Other alloys and steels must be provided with a protective finish.. "
What are the classifications of reactions that occur between tank materials and contained fluids under service conditions?,The reactions which occur in conditions of service between the tank materials and the fluids contained can be classified as follows © stress-corrosion cracking;e galvanic corrosion; ¢ loss of ductility due to hydrogen; and e ignition. A brief description is given below for each type of reaction.
What factors contribute to the occurrence of cracking in high-stressed tanks as described in the text?,"According to the definition given in [38], stress-corrosion cracking is a cracking process caused by the conjoint action of stress and a corrodent. Stress-corrosion cracking is one of the principal causes of failure of high-stressed tanks. Corrosion can be due to either the fluids contained in the tanks or the environments to which the tanks are exposed. The most common of such environments is atmospheric air, which contains moisture, salts, and other chemical substances due to industrial processes. "
What factors influence the impact of stress-corrosion on materials?,"The effects of stress-corrosion on a given material depend on the stress sustained by the material, the degree of corrosion of the environment, and the time of exposure of the material to the environment.. "
What are the methods to prevent stress-corrosion cracking in storage tanks?,Means commonly used to avoid stress-corrosion cracking in tanks are e choice of materials resisting to corrosive environments or protection of susceptiblee reduction of tensile stresses in materials exposed to corrosive environments; and e reduction of the times of exposure.
What document outlines the chemical makeup of certain titanium alloys used in military tanks and the corrosive substances linked to stress-corrosion cracking?,"The matter of corrosion and protection of metals from corrosion forms the subject of the military standards MIL-HDBK-729 [39]. In particular, Table XIV on p. 127 of [39] indicates the chemical composition of some titanium alloys used for tanks, and the related corrosive substances, for which stress-corrosion cracking has been observed."
Which aluminium alloy series is most prone to cracking due to stress when exposed to atmospheric conditions?,"In particular, aluminium alloys of the 2XXX and 7XXX series are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking in atmospheric environments. Titanium alloys are normally resistant to atmospheric environments, but are susceptible to salt and other sources of chlorine which remain in contact with the metals at temperatures above about 561 K. Some titanium alloys have also been found to be susceptible to sea water at room temperatures [22].. "
What scientific phenomenon occurs due to electrochemical reactions and can manifest at both macro and micro levels?,"A comparison of the resistance of various alloys to stress-corrosion cracking in atmosphere and in other environments is given in Table VII on pp. 35 and 36 of [22].Galvanic corrosion, so called after the Italian scientist Luigi Galvani, is an elec- trochemical phenomenon which occurs either on a macro-scale or on a micro-scale."
What is the effect on the corrosion rates of dissimilar metals in an electrolytic solution compared to their corrosion when isolated in the same medium?,"On a macro-scale, it is the increased corrosion (deterioration) of the more active metal (anode) of a couple of dissimilar metals in an electrolytic solution or medium and the decreased corrosion of the less active metal (cathode) as compared to the corrosion of the individual metals, when not connected, in the same electrolytic environment. By electrolytic solution, we mean a solution capable of conducting an electric current. An example is common sea water.. "
What phenomenon drives galvanic corrosion in two metals when in contact within an electrolyte?,The dissimilarity which provides the driving force to galvanic corrosion is the difference in the electrode potential of each of the two metals when they are in elec- trical contact through the electrolyte. Electrode potential is a measure of the tendency of a metal to become more active than another metal when they are immersed in a given electrolyte.
What is the purpose of a galvanic series in relation to metals and alloys' corrosion tendencies?,"A galvanic series is a list of metals and alloys based on their order and tendency to corrode independently in a particular electrolytic solution or in other environment.  A galvanic series in sea water, due to the courtesy of NASA [40], is given below. This series is arranged in order of increasing activity."
What are the characteristics of chromium stainless steel type 410 in terms of its passive and active states regarding corrosion?,"13 percent chromium stainless steel, type 410 (passive)13 percent chromium stainless steel, type 410 (active)When galvanic corrosion occurs on a macro-scale, the anodic and cathodic areas are easily discerned."
What factors can contribute to the occurrence of micro-scale galvanic corrosion in metals?,"On a micro-scale, galvanic corrosion may occur with one metal having dissim- ilarities (for example, impurity inclusions, grains of different sizes, difference in composition of grains, differences in mechanical stress), abnormal level of pH, and high temperatures [41]. When galvanic corrosion occurs on a micro-scale, the anodic and cathodic areas can only be discerned by metallographic techniques or deduced by inference or observations of the corroded metal [39].. "
What factors typically minimize the risk of galvanic corrosion in liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"Galvanic corrosion can occur within a tank containing an electrically conductive fluid, or outside a tank exposed to atmospheric moisture. Generally speaking, in liquid-propellant rocket engines, galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals is of little or no concern, because most propellants either have little electrical conductivity, or do not develop significant electrode potentials in contact with normal structural metals, or both [22]. "
What issues can occur when using inadequately tested chemicals or when different liquid substances interact with various metal types?,"However, this problem may arise when new or inadequately tested propellants are used either alone or in the presence of contaminants, or when liquids other than propellants (for example, water) are in contact with dissimilar metals.. "
"What methods are available to shield metals from deterioration, including both coatings and treatments?","Metals can be protected from corrosion by providing them with a coating or a treatment. The coating may be a paint, a sealant, a resin coating, or a metallic coating. Several types of coatings, used to protect specific metals, are described at length in [42]. The treatment may be a surface or bulk treatment, a chemical or mechanical treatment, or a combination of these."
What is the term used to describe metals that develop a protective film to resist corrosion when exposed to aggressive conditions?,"Some metals effectively resist corrosion damages because of their ability to form and maintain, when exposed to an aggressive environment, an adherent and imper- vious film. These metals are said to have become passivated. However, many of the common or structural metals used for tanks are either scarcely efficient or unable in producing such protective films. Consequently, protective coatings or treatments are applied to many common metals to prevent or reduce corrosion [39].. "
"What is the effect of hydrogen absorption on the mechanical properties of metals, specifically regarding ductility and potential failure mechanisms?","Metals which are in contact with pure hydrogen should be evaluated for suscepti- bility to loss of ductility in the presence of hydrogen. This phenomenon, also known as hydrogen-assisted fracture, is due to the easy absorption and subsequent diffusion of hydrogen into metals. On a microscopic scale, hydrogen atoms tend to segregate in certain parts of the crystal lattice of a metal, thereby weakening its chemical bonds. Consequently, the walls of a metallic tank containing hydrogen become brittle, which can lead to failure.. "
Which authors have conducted investigations related to the interaction between metals and hydrogen?,"The compatibility of metals with hydrogen has been investigated by several authors. Some of them are Cataldo [43], Caskey [44], San Marchi and Somerday [45], and Chandler [46]. A brief account is given below."
"Which type of alloys are primarily affected by hydrogen-induced brittleness, especially when they possess higher strength characteristics?","Brittleness of metals due to hydrogen occurs principally in ferrous alloys, such as high-strength and martensitic steels. In most cases, the greater the strength of a metal, the more susceptible it is to brittleness caused by hydrogen. Low-strength metals, such as copper, aluminium, and nickel alloys, have low susceptibility to  hydrogen damage. However, in case of these metals having undergone a strain- hardening process, there would be a greater risk of induced brittleness.. "
What is the significance of selecting a metal with low strength for maintaining ductility while ensuring it can support operational loads?,"In some cases, steels and alloys of low strength can be used to decrease the risk of loss of ductility. However, of course, the metal chosen must withstand the loads applied to it during operation."
What is the sequence of materials based on the percentage decrease in notch strength when exposed to gaseous hydrogen at a specific pressure?,"In quantitative terms, the following table, adapted from [43], shows the effects induced by gaseous hydrogen, at a pressure of 6.895 x 10’ N/m”, in various alloys. ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIALS IN ORDER OF PERCENT REDUCTION OF NOTCH STRENGTH IN 6.895x10’ N/m? HYDROGEN"
What is the relationship between yield strength and percent reduction in a material's notch strength expressed in N/m'?,Yield Strength Percent Reduction Alloy N/m’ Notch Strength
"What relationship exists between notch strength reduction and ambient material strength, and what materials exhibit exceptions to this relationship?","As has been anticipated above, the reduction in notch strength resulting from the preceding table is inversely related to the ambient strength of the material, but there are exceptions to this rule. For example, the A-286 stainless steel (an age-hardened iron base superalloy) has a high yield strength, but an apparent low susceptibility to hydrogen. The best alloys are aluminium alloys, copper, and stabilised stainless steels [43].. "
What types of materials are advised against using for tanks that hold strong oxidisers due to potential ignition or violent reactions?,"The materials which are used for tanks containing propellants should not be susceptible to ignition or to violent reactions in the presence of the propellants. Consequently, titanium and titanium alloys should not be used for tanks containing oxidisers such as red fuming nitric acid, liquid oxygen, pressurised gaseous oxygen, mixtures of liquid oxygen and liquid fluorine, and other strong oxidisers. "
What factors should be assessed to prevent ignition when using titanium and its alloys with oxidizers?,"It is also necessary to consider the possibility of ignition due to impact, rupture, friction, elec- tricity, heat, or any other source of highly concentrated energy. This holds in particular  with titanium and titanium alloys in contact with oxidisers [22]. For the same reason, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, and other alloys which contain free elements should not be used with hydrazine or with other propellants related to hydrazine. "
What is essential to verify regarding the materials used in tanks before they interact with stored propellants?,"As a general tule, it is necessary to ascertain the compatibility of the materials used for tanks with the propellants (in liquid and gaseous phases) to be contained in them, before such materials come in contact with the related propellants.. "
What are the potential impacts of flaws in pressure vessels on load capacity and operational longevity?,"Tanks and other pressure vessels containing propellants may have flaws or defects which are either present in the original materials before processing or induced in the materials by processes of fabrication. These defects can reduce the capability of carrying loads and the operational life of the tanks. When such defects are large in comparison with those causing failure, then failure occurs as soon as the tanks are put under pressure for test purposes. "
What is the relationship between the size of small defects and the number of pressure loading cycles a tank can endure before failing?,"When such defects are small, the tanks may withstand several cycles of pressure loading for a considerable number of hours before the size of the defects grows to such an extent as to cause failure.. "
What are the two primary reasons for minimizing tank failure in space vehicle applications?,"It is necessary, for reasons of economy, to reduce the possibility of failure of tanks used for a space vehicles during testing. It is mandatory, for reason of both safety of the crew and economy, to reduce the possibility of failure of such tanks during operation."
What are the key criteria and practices essential for designing metal containers intended for propellants to minimize failure risks?,"The present section presents criteria and practices to be used in the design of metallic tanks for propellants, in order to reduce the possibility of failures caused by defects during test, pre-flight, and flight."
What are the two key aspects involved in understanding flaws that lead to fracture and their potential for growth under stress?,"e the critical sizes of the flaws (meaning by that, the sizes required to cause fracture at a given level of stress); and¢ the subcritical characteristics of the flaws which can cause their growth."
What must be demonstrated to ensure that the largest initial flaw in a tank does not reach a critical size during its operational lifespan?,"To prevent failures during test, the initial sizes of the flaws must be less than the critical sizes at the level of stress given to the material in test phase. To prevent failures during service, it must be proven that the largest possible size of an initial flaw in a tank cannot grow to the critical size during the required operational life of the tank."
"What factors influence the critical size of a defect in a material according to stress, toughness, thickness, and defect orientation?","The critical size of a flaw depends on the level of stress, on the toughness of the material to fracture, on the thickness of the wall, and on the location and direction of the flaw. The determination of the initial size of a flaw is limited by the available methods of non-destructive inspection. However, further information may come from the results of a successful proof test. In other words, a proof test in which a tank has not failed provides information on the maximum possible value of the ratio of the initial to critical stress level. This value, in turn, makes it possible to estimate the maximum possible size of the initial flaws. . "
What factors influence the development of subcritical flaws in materials?,"The growth of subcritical flaws depends on the stress level, the initial size of the flaws, the material, the environment, and the pressure applied as a function of time to a given tank."
What happens to a tank during testing if an initial flaw exceeds the critical size for the applied stress?,"Examples of flaws which are rarely detected in metallic tanks or in other pressure vessels are surface flaws and internal flaws. When a tank has an initial flaw whose size exceeds the critical size at the level of stress applied in testing, then the tank fails just in phase of testing. A tank fails in service, when the size of an initial flaw is less than the critical size at the level of stress applied in testing, but this size grows due to the stress applied in service to such an extent as to reach the critical size at the level of stress applied in service. "
What occurs when the dimensions of a flaw increase throughout the thickness of a tank's wall prior to achieving a critical size?,"When the size of an initial flaw grows through the thickness of the wall of a tank before reaching the critical size, then leakage occurs.. "
What defines a tank as thick-walled in relation to flaw size and wall thickness?,"In the elastic field of stress, the critical sizes of surface and internal flaws depend on the critical value K;, (Pa m”, where 1 Pa = 1 N/m?) of the fracture toughness of the material, and on the level of the stress applied. When the critical sizes of the flaws are small in comparison with the thickness of the wall, then a tank is said to be thick-walled. Otherwise, when the critical sizes of the flaws approach or exceed the thickness of the wall, then a tank is said to be thin-walled.. "
What equation is used to determine the critical dimensions of minor internal defects in uniformly loaded thick-walled pressure vessels?,The critical sizes of surface flaws in uniformly stressed thick-walled tanks can be calculated by using the following equation of [47]:The critical sizes of small internal flaws in uniformly stressed thick-walled tanks
"What is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, defined in relation to the parameters of an ellipse and an angular variable of integration?","can be calculated by using the following equation of [47]: a 1 (Kite 2 0), xo In the two preceding equations, a (m) is the minor semi-axis of the ellipse of equation xy? eta! that is, a (m) is the depth of the semi-elliptic surface flaw, 2c (m) is the length of the semi-elliptic surface flaw, Q is the flaw-shape parameter defined as follows o\2 Q=""- 0212() Oys o is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, of modulus k = (1 — a?/c?)*, defined as follows  z 5 1 1 Ce - a z ok) =f —k’ sin? 0)?d0 = [(: - <<"" sin?) do Cc 0 0 @ (rad) is an angular variable of integration, o (N/m?) is the uniform gross stress applied at infinity in a direction perpendicular to the plane of crack, and o,, (N/m’) is the uniaxial tensile yield strength of the material. "
What is the relationship between the flaw-shape parameter and the flaw depth-to-length ratio in the provided figures?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [47], shows the relationship between the flaw-shape parameter Q and the flaw depth-to-length ratio a/(2c). os 17 - |_ Z£ 2c -+| a 2c 2a Ae | .% Surface flaw Internal flaw Za | | | $ 0 GZ 2 O10y5> as \N jj é 04 NN x, tj Q = ¢?- 0.212 (0/0, )?

"
What is the maximum depth of a semi-elliptic surface flaw relative to material thickness for which the provided equation is deemed accurate?,"In order to predict critical flaw sizes, failure modes, and operational life of thin- walled tanks or pressure vessels, it is necessary to know the stress intensity for flaws which become very deep with respect to the wall thickness. The solution given by the preceding equation (a/Q),, = (Ki¢/o)?/(1.217) for a semi-elliptic surface flaw has been found to be sufficiently accurate for flaw depths up to about 50% of the thickness of the material [47]. "
How does the presence of a free surface affect stress intensity at the tip of deeper flaws in thin-walled structures?,"For flaws of greater depths, the intensity of the stress applied is magnified by the effect of the free surface near the flaw tip. In other words, in thin-walled tanks, the flaw-tip stress intensity can reach the critical value Kj, at a flaw size smaller than that which results from the preceding equation (a/Q)er = (Kte/o)? (1.217).. "
What is the relationship between the magnification factor and the fracture toughness critical value in materials' stress analysis?,"The effect of the magnification factor Mx on the critical value K;. of the fracture toughness of a material is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [47].  2.0 = 1.8 5 , g Ky = 1.1Mg fota/ay# E OT F 1.6 = 3 a E 2 14 Kobayashi's solution 7 2 for small a/2c values, 7 8 2 12 4 for a/2c = 0.50 Ss ee bar 0.2 0.4 0.6 08 1.0 Flaw-depth-to-wall thickness ratio, a/t The magnification factor Mx is applied to the equation (a/Q), = (K1./0)?/(1.2 12) as follows 1 Kye = 1AMgx?

What is the range of Mx values for semi-circular flaws compared to flaws with smaller ratios of a/(2c)?,"This application determines the critical value of the fracture toughness in case of deep surface flaws (such that the value of a/(2c) is small).As shown in the preceding figure, the value of Mx has been found to vary from less than 1.1 for semi-circular flaws (a = c, and therefore a/(2c) = 0.50) to 1.6 for flaws having smaller values of a/(2c)."
What equation is applicable for the analysis of flaws in tanks that are significantly longer than their depth?,"In case of tanks having flaws which are long with respect to their depth (Q ~ 1), the following equation can be used for a thin-walled tank"
What laboratory tests are necessary to obtain values of Kj for both the original material and welds in a thick-walled tank?,"Kig= L.1Mgxioa? and the following equation can be used for a thick-walled tank Kic = L.laioa?In order to predict the critical sizes for surface and internal flaws by using the preceding equation (a/Q)¢ = (Kie/o)?/(1.2177), it is necessary to know the values of Kj. for the original material and for the welds of a tank. These values can be obtained from laboratory tests. "
What is the method used to ascertain the actual initial flaw dimensions in a tank prior to failure?,"In order to prevent failure in a tank, either the actual initial flaw sizes or the maximum possible initial flaw sizes must be known. Non-destructive inspection is the only means of determining the actual initial flaw sizes. A successful proof test provides a measure of the maximum possible initial-to-critical stress intensity ratio, and this in turn makes it possible to estimate the maximum possible initial flaw sizes.. "
What are some non-invasive methods utilized for examining rocket tanks?,"Non-destructive inspection techniques commonly used for rocket tanks are radio- graphic testing, ultrasonic testing, liquid penetrant testing, and magnetic particle testing. Other techniques are eddy current testing and infrared testing [47]."
"What challenges exist in detecting certain types of flaws, such as tight cracks, during inspection processes?","When multiple inspection techniques (for example, radiographic testing, ultra- sonic testing, and liquid penetrant testing) are used, then most surface and internal flaws are detected. However, it is not safe to assume that all existing flaws can be detected at any time, because some of them (for example, tight cracks) are particu- larly difficult to detect. The largest initial flaw sizes which cannot escape detection cannot be established with confidence. "
What is the role of non-destructive inspection in preventing failures in high-strength tanks?,"The inspection techniques commonly used do not measure precisely the lengths and the depths of the initial flaws to be used in a fracture mechanics analysis. However, it is necessary to rely on non-destructive inspection to prevent proof-test failures of most high-strength tanks [47].. "
What does a successful proof test at a certain pressure indicate about the ratio of fracture toughness to the plane-strain stress-intensity factor for a tank?,"Proof-pressure testing is probably the most reliable non-destructive inspection technique available to ensure the absence of initial flaws of sufficient sizes to cause failure of a tank in operating conditions. Let K;; (Pa m”) and Kj, (Pa m”) be respec- tively the plane-strain stress-intensity factor at the initial conditions and the fracture toughness of a given material. A successful proof test conducted at a pressure of a times the maximum pressure in operating conditions indicates that the maximum possible value of the ratio Kj/K;- is equal to 1/a. This value can be used with subcritical flaw-growth data to estimate the minimum life of a tank.. "
What factors determine the permissible ratio related to the service duration and flaw-growth characteristics for a tank's design?,"From the point of view of the initial design, the minimum required proof-test factor a for a tank isThe allowable value of the ratio K;;/K;. depends on the required service life of the tank and on the subcritical flaw-growth properties of the material [47]."
What is the relationship between membrane stresses and the yield strength of a material during proof testing of a tank?,"In order to prevent yielding in proof testing, the membrane stresses applied to a tank are limited to a value equal to or less than the yield strength of the material."
What happens to the critical flaw sizes when the applied stress surpasses the yield strength of a material?,"In practice, the local level of stress may exceed the yield strength of the mate- rial, because there may be discontinuities due to design or manufacturing, and also because of the presence of residual stresses. When the applied stress approaches and exceeds the yield strength of the material, the critical flaw-size curve deviates from the theoretical curve based on a constant value of K;,, and therefore the critical flaw sizes are smaller than those predicted by the linear-elastic theory of fracture mechanics.. "
What is the relationship between the maximum value of the ratio K;;/K; and the constant a when a tank exceeds the yield strength during testing?,"When the stress applied to a tank at proof pressure exceeds the yield strength of the material and the tank also passes the proof test, then the maximum possible value of the ratio K;;/K;. resulting from the test is smaller than 1/a. In this case,  the minimum operational life of the tank should exceed the required life, which has previously been used to determine a."
What is the relationship between a proof-test factor and the wall thickness or fracture toughness of a tank's material?,"In is to be observed that the equation a = 1/(allowable value of the ratio K;;/K;.), which expresses the required minimum proof-test factor a for a tank, does not take account of the thickness of the tank. However, the value of the proof test in providing assurance against failure in service changes with decreasing wall thickness or with increasing fracture toughness K;. of the material [47]."
What is the method to calculate the minimum proof-test factor when there is a temperature difference between the proof test and operating conditions?,"When a proof test is performed at a temperature which differs from the temperature in operating conditions, then the required minimum value of the proof-test factor is expressed by the following equation of [47]:1 K},at proof — test temperature 6 Ss >< allowable K ;;/ K ;,at operating temperature K/,at operating temperature"
What are alternative fluids that can be employed in proof tests for high-strength alloys to prevent flaw growth?,"The choice of the proper fluid to be used in a proof test is an important consid- eration for all alloys. Water may have a detrimental effect in high-strength alloys, because it promotes slow growth of flaws due to the effect of hydrogen cracking. This problem has been solved by using either other fluids, such as oil, or water with corrosion inhibitors, such as sodium bichromate (Cr2Na2O7), or distilled water.. "
What factors influence the duration or cycles required for a flaw in a pressure vessel to reach a critical dimension after loading?,"Subcritical flaw growth can occur after cyclic loading, sustained-stress loading, and combined cyclic and sustained-stress loading. Data from fracture specimen tests can be used in a fracture mechanics analysis to predict the number of cycles or the time needed for an initial flaw in a tank under sustained pressure to grow to critical size. The time or the number of cycles needed to cause failure has been found to depend primarily on the ratio Kj)/K ic.. "
What relationship does the ratio of minimum to maximum stress exhibit concerning cycles to fracture in a heat-treated titanium alloy?,"The following figure, adapted from [47], shows the ratio K;;/K;, versus cycles to fracture for a heat-treated Ti-6A1-4V alloy in air at room temperature. The quantity R is the ratio of the minimum stress to the maximum stress during a cycle. Both the best-fit, least-square curve and the 96% probability, 99% curve are shown in the plot."

"
What property indicates a minimum stress intensity required for flaw growth in materials during sustained-stress experiments?,An important property observed in all sustained-stress experiments of flaw growth is the existence of a threshold level of stress intensity for a given material in a given environment.
What term is used to describe the stress intensity threshold above which flaw growth and potential fracture are observed?,"In other words, below a given value of stress intensity (or of Kj;/K 1, ratio), flaw growth has not been detected. Above this value, flaw growth occurs and can result in fracture. This stress intensity has been designated as K ry."
What is the significance of determining the unique value of K ry for material design in various environments?,"The discovery of a unique value of K ry for a given material in a given environment makes it possible to design a safe tank subject to a sustained load.Kry may be 80% of K;- or higher in an inert environment, but may also be less than 50% of K;, in a hostile environment."
What is the threshold value symbol for a Ti-6A1-4V alloy when subjected to a sustained load in various liquids?,"The threshold value K7y for a Ti-6A1-4V alloy subject to sustained load in two different liquids (distilled water and methanol) is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [47]."
What is the time duration in hours during which no failure occurs despite flaw growth?,"1.00 -—— e ooh TTT TT | TT TT oe eo ee <2 ae ee ee = LL eT INCE ee TD Pe SN ETT eto ti pet Ss &% 0.40 p< eo SSE 5 . | Distilled — Methenol 1 | te Hl | ° fone el LL = 0.10 ~- No failure with flaw growth i | eT 100.0 7000.0 Time, hr."
How does the value of Kz change with variations in specimen thickness?,"The value of K7y has been found to decrease with increasing yield strength in steel alloys. The flaw growth for sustained load has the highest values in conditions of plane strain. The values of Kz, determined from tests of specimens cracked through the thickness, increase with decrease in specimen thickness."
What happens to the rate of crack growth in inert environments as stress intensity increases after reaching a minimum value?,"In chemically inert environments, the crack growth rate initially decreases with increasing stress intensity. When the initial stress intensity is sufficiently low, the crack may halt. At higher stress intensities, the crack growth rate passes through a minimum value and then increases steadily until the crack becomes unstable. This behaviour has been observed for AM 350® steel (a heat-treatable austenitic or martensitic alloy, depending on heat treatment) in a purified argon environment.. "
What are the defined values of stress intensity in alloys that distinguish between expected flaw growth and no flaw growth?,"For some alloys, such as Ti-5Al-2.5Sn (ELI) and 2219-T87, two thresholds have been observed in environments of room air, liquid nitrogen, and liquid hydrogen. One of these threshold stress intensities was defined as the value of stress above which flaw growth to failure can be expected. The other of them was defined as the value of stress below which there is no flaw growth. In the interval between these  two threshold intensities, small amounts of flaw growth can occur, but the growth apparently arrests after a short time at load [47]. "

"
What are the main considerations to ensure the reliability and safety of metallic tanks used in rocket engines?,"Some criteria to be observed in the design of metallic tanks for rocket engines have been identified by Tiffany [47]. They may be summarised as follows. All tanks must be designed to avoid failure in service caused by flaws and to ensure a very low probability of catastrophic failure caused by flaws during proof tests. For this purpose, it is necessary to consider not only the internal pressure to which a tank is subject, but also the pressures, temperatures, environments, and stresses to which the tank is exposed.. "
What are the essential properties that tank materials must possess to ensure safety and reliability based on established military standards?,"The materials used for tanks must have appropriate characteristics of fracture- growth and flaw-growth. These characteristics must come from reliable sources of data, for example, from the military standards MIL-HDBK-5 J [25], and must also be confirmed by tests."
How should initial flaws in tanks be evaluated to ensure they can be identified without damage while not reaching critical dimensions over their operational lifespan?,"The critical flaw sizes must be determined for the stress levels of interest by either analysis or tests, as appropriate. If possible, the maximum size of initial flaws allowable in tanks should be so great as to be detected by non-destructive inspection, but not so great as to grow to critical size during life in service."
What must be true about the initial size of flaws in relation to the critical size under proof pressure stress levels?,The allowable initial size of flaws must be less than the critical size at the level of stress of proof pressure. The initial stress intensity ratio allowable in a tank must be chosen to ensure that the critical intensity ratio is not attained during the design life of the tank.
What aspects should be considered when determining the proof pressure for a tank test?,"Each tank must be proof tested. The level of proof pressure must be chosen to demonstrate that the tank is free of flaws larger than the allowable initial size, or that the actual initial stress-intensity ratio is less than the allowable initial stress-intensity ratio. Account must be taken of the differences between the proof test temperature and the service temperature, and of the time required to apply or remove pressure during the proof test.. "
What factors contribute to maximum assurance of safe performance during proof tests in structural materials?,"In order to prevent failures in proof tests, low levels of stress and materials having high values of fracture toughness must be used during such tests. By so doing, the critical sizes of flaws are large and greater than the thickness of the tank walls. Consequently, the worst case which can occur during proof testing is leakage. In order to obtain maximum assurance of safe performance in service, it is desirable to use large proof-test factors, low levels of operational stresses, and materials having low rates of flaw growth under cyclic loads and high values of K 7, in the expected environment of service.. "
"What factors contribute to increased mass in tank design, and how can trade-offs lead to an optimal compromise?","On the other hand, the use of large proof-test factors, low levels of operational stresses, and materials having high values of fracture toughness leads often to high masses of tanks. Therefore, trade-offs can and should be made to arrive to an optimum compromise for a given tank."
What are the primary components involved in the structural design of tanks?,"6.9 Structural Elements of Tanks The structural elements considered in the present section are tank shells, weld joints, access openings, support fittings, and accessory attachment provisions. "
"What external pressure, measured in N/m², must tank shells and associated components be designed to endure?","Not only the tank shells but also the other elements are required to withstand internal and external pressures, the latter acting during propellant servicing or during decontamination. Vacuum is frequently used to remove gas from the liquid side of expulsion devices (described in Sect. 6.6), and also to remove residual propellants from tanks. The tank shells and the other elements are required to withstand an external pressure of one atmosphere (101325 N/m7).. "
What are the key factors influencing the design of tanks used in rocket engines?,"One of the principal requirements of tanks for rocket engines is low mass. Other requirements are cost, schedule times, easiness of manufacturing, reliability and availability of the materials used for them, technical skills of the personnel, tools, and testing facilities."
What elements are considered in the comprehensive design process of a tank structure?,"In the phase of structural design, the detailed design of a tank includes sidewall, fore and aft bulkheads, access openings, and accessory mounting provisions. The design of these elements depends on the material chosen for the tank. The detailed design of a tank also includes the primary structural junctures."
What factors should be considered in evaluating the loads applied to a storage vessel according to engineering analyses?,The design of a tank is based on the relation between the loads imposed and the capability of the tank to withstand such loads. Wagner and Keller [22] have identified the following factors to be taken into account in the analysis of the loads imposed on a tank:
"What term refers to the maximum stress a structure can withstand under specified conditions, including potential variations?","e limit load or stress, which is the maximum stress or pressure which the tank struc- ture is expected to bear, in the specified operating conditions and with allowance for possible variations;"
"What is the purpose of a safety factor in design, and how does it relate to material properties and load distribution?","e design safety factor, which is a multiplier, whose value (greater than unity) is chosen by the designer to take account of small variations of the properties of the material, of the quality of manufacturing, and of the magnitude and distribution of the load in the structure;e design load or stress, which is the limit load multiplied by the design safety factor;"
"What term describes the maximum allowable load or stress that must not be exceeded to prevent failure due to buckling, yielding, or ultimate loading?","e allowable load or stress, which is the load not to be exceeded to avoid failure, the latter being due to either buckling, or yield, or ultimate loading; and"
How is the margin of safety calculated in relation to the allowable and design loads?,"e margin of safety (m,), which is the fraction by which the allowable load exceeds the design load, as followsallowable load or stress 1 ms = (limit load or stress) x (design safety factor)"
What is the range of design safety factor values typically used for yield stress in rocket vehicle structures?,"The magnitude of the design safety factor depends on the degree of confidence in the properties of the materials, on the processes of production, and on the validity of the predicted conditions of use. In practice, a uniform design safety factor is chosen by the designer for the entire structure of a rocket vehicle on the basis of experience and judgement. Values in use for the design safety factor range from 1.0 to 1.1 for yield stress and from 1.25 to 1.5 for ultimate stress, the higher values being used for manned flight vehicles.. "
What types of stresses must a rocket tank's structure endure to maintain its integrity during operation?,"The structure of a rocket tank is required to withstand the stresses due to vibration, thermal shock, propellant slosh, and internal pressure. This structure is also required  to provide the load path for the loads acting on the body of the rocket vehicle. The structural elements of a rocket tank are subject to different types of stresses, which are briefly described below for each element. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [49], shows schematically the structural elements of the S-IVB (the third stage of the Saturn IV launch vehicle), which has one J-2 engine. "
What is the purpose of the common bulkhead in a thrust structure?,"No FORWARD SKIRT PNG TANKIDONES vocnts PO TANK CYLINDER 4 %, N SS ees ee 4~O COMMON BULKHEAD _—) THRUST STRUCTURE NO aoamene ——() INTERSTAGE. "
What combined factors determine the circumferential stresses in a tank sidewall?,"The tank sidewall of a tank is subject to pressure, inertial forces due to the propel- lant, axial loads, and bending moments. The circumferential stresses are determined by combining the ullage pressure, the load pressure, and the inertial force due to the propellant. The meridian stresses are determined by combining the ullage pressure, the axial loads, and the bending moments."
What factors must be considered to evaluate stress at a specific location on tank end closures during acceleration?,"The stresses acting on the end closures of a tank result from the ullage pressure and the acceleration impressed on the propellant. During the boost time, the aft bulkheads of tanks have a maximum pressure at the apex, and the forward bulkheads have a minimum pressure at the apex. In order to evaluate the stress at a specific location on the end closures, the pressure and the shape of the closure must be considered.. "
How is the load distribution on bulkheads assessed for adjacent storage tanks with separate divisions?,"When there are separate bulkheads on two contiguous tanks, the load acting on each of them is to be determined as indicated above for end closures of tanks. "
What factors influence the pressure loads acting on a common bulkhead in comparison to end closures of tanks?,"A single common bulkhead is subject to either burst or collapse loads and to temperature gradients through its thickness. The pressure loads acting at any given point of a common bulkhead are determined as described above for end closures of tanks, but a common bulkhead is subject only to the difference between the forward pressure and the aft pressure acting at any given point. The stability under collapsing pressure loads is obtained by designing a bulkhead of large bending stiffness in comparison with its membrane stiffness. "
What type of shell is commonly utilized for a tank requiring complex analysis of internal loading?,"A stiffened skin for a tank requires a more complex analysis of internal loads. In this case, a multi-layer shell of revolution is frequently used.. "
How do local loads at the junction of a tank and other components affect attachment bolts and immediate structural elements compared to contiguous structural elements?,A tank is also subject to local loads at any point in which it is mated to other components of a rocket vehicle. The magnitudes and the directions of these loads depend on the weight of each component multiplied by an amplification factor due to acceleration and vibration. The magnitude of these loads is felt to its full extent by the attachment bolts and by the immediate structural elements. It is felt to a lesser extent by the contiguous structural elements. 
"How is the lower magnitude assessed based on experience and judgment, particularly relating to the damping effects distant from the excitation source?","This lower magnitude is evaluated according to criteria suggested by experience and judgement, taking account of the damping which occurs away from the point of excitation.. "
What is the minimum ratio of radius of curvature to thickness assumed for liquid-propellant rocket engine tanks to simplify stress and strain formulas?,"In most cases, tanks for liquid-propellant rocket engines are thin-walled surfaces of revolution, meaning by that, structures whose thickness ¢ is assumed constant and much smaller than the radii R of curvature of its middle surface [2]. In practice, the value of R/t is assumed greater than 10. As has been shown in the first four sections of the present chapter, this assumption permits the use of simple formulas for stress and strain, such as those which are given in [3].. "
What factors must be evaluated to determine the appropriate materials and their thicknesses for a design?,"The choice of the materials and the evaluation of the corresponding thicknesses and stresses can be done by using only data on mechanical properties with safety factors selected by the designer. Of course, practical considerations concerning manu- facturing, handling, and stiffness are also taken into account in this preliminary choice. Before this choice can take place, the level of stress in working condition, the thickness of the skin, and the fracture strength of the materials must be evaluated. "
What attributes must a material have to ensure adequate service life for a specific tank?,"The proposed material must possess appropriate values of toughness and resistance to the growth of subcritical flaws, in order to comply with the requirements of life service for a given tank.. "
What factors influence the determination of skin thickness for a tank sidewall?,"After a material has been chosen, the proof-test stress, the operational stress, and the non-destructive inspection requirements are defined according to the desired mission performance. The skin thickness is determined by taking account of the most restrictive conditions, such as safety factor, criteria of fracture control, manu- facturing, and handling. The skin thickness for the sidewall of a tank depends on the product of the circumferential tension load under the predicted maximum pressure times the factor of safety [22]. "
What is the effect of internal pressure on the forces acting on the walls of a tank during flight?,"In order to reduce mass, the skin thickness should be as low as possible. There are several methods for constructing thin-walled tanks. Sometimes, a tank can be put under internal pressure to keep its walls from buckling. This is because the net tensional force due to internal pressure is made greater than the compressional force due to the flight loads. Consequently, the tank is only subject to tension, and buckling is avoided. "
What technique is employed to enhance stability in thin metallic sheets in traditional aircraft construction?,"Such was the case with the Atlas and Centaur launch vehicles, in which additional membrane rigidity was obtained through the internal  working pressure within the tank [22]. Another method of stabilising thin metallic sheets is used in the construction of conventional aircraft. In this method, stiffening members (stringers) are fastened to the skin in the direction of the compressive loads, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [50]. "
What method uses a repetitive equilateral triangular pattern for structural reinforcement in metal components?,"ed N VEEN SEN OS The same result can also be obtained in a single piece of metal by chemically milling or machining a solid sheet to remove all metal except ribs or waffles which act as stringers, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [50], which illustrates a rectangular waffle structure. Rox ES = Still another method (developed by McDonnell Douglas) of stiffening a skin is the use of an isogrid structure, in which the ribs are arranged in a repetitive equilateral triangular pattern, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [51], where an isogrid structure (left) and a square waffle structure (right) are illustrated. "

What documentation provides the specific calculation techniques for isogrid frameworks used in the Delta launch vehicle's outer shell design?,Details and methods of calculation for isogrid structures are given in [49]. Thismethod was used for the external skin structure of the Delta launch vehicle [51].
What are the primary design types for pressure tanks in large space vehicles?,"Summarising, the sidewall skin is usually stiffened against buckling by using stringers, frames, or ribs spaced in a grid pattern (either isogrid or rectangular waffle). The sidewall design is particularly important for tanks of large space vehicles. This is because the sidewall in such vehicles not only contains the propellant but also transmits the body loads. The principal types of sidewall designs for tanks under pressure are skin-stringer-frame, grid, and monocoque.. "
"What factors influence the design choice of a tank's structure, considering body loads and propellant types?","The choice of one or another type of design for a tank depends on the magnitude of the body loads applied externally and on the type of propellant to be contained in the tank. A highly loaded sidewall is usually designed with the skin-stringer- frame structure, whereas a lightly loaded sidewall is designed with the waffle or isogrid structure. A very lightly loaded sidewall can be designed with the monocoque structure, but pressurising is often required for stability.. "
What design approach minimizes leakage risks in structural components of propulsion tanks by integrating skin and stringers?,"Integral stiffening is the type of skin-stringer design which is best suited to propel- lant tanks [22]. This type of design eliminates the many sources of possible leakage associated with the points of mechanical attachment involving the skin, the stringers, and the frames constructed in the conventional manner."
What are the two distinct designs of stringers depicted by NASA in the figure?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22], shows two types of skin-stringer designs. They are: (a) “Blade” stringer; and (b) “T” stringer."
What is the mechanical assembly method described for the components in type (a) stringer design?,"Stringer Membrane Stringer (skin) —— ? Celis eH 2 e-2-2-0 (RSS SRS sH ooo a Frame (a) “Blade” stringer (b) “T” stringerThe type (a), shown on the left-hand side of the preceding figure, consists of panels in which the skin, the “blade” stingers, and the horizontal ribs are machined as an integral unit, where the frames are attached mechanically to the horizontal ribs after the panels are formed. "
"What components are present in the panels that are machined in the specified type, and how are frames added after the forming process?","The type (b), shown on the right-hand side of the preceding figure, consists of panels in which only the skin and the “T” stringers are machined, and the frames are added after forming by mechanical attachment to the inboard flanges of the “T” stringers [22]."
What factors influence the thickness of a structure's skin regarding internal pressure and tension?,The thickness of the skin depends on the circumferential tensional loads under maximum internal pressure. The stringer spacing depends on the local requirements of stability. The stringer configuration and the frame spacing for tanks of minimum mass depend on general requirements of stability under axial compressive loads combined with internal pressures.
What properties must the sidewall material possess to ensure effective machinability and forming capabilities in structural design?,"The material used for a sidewall of skin-stringer-frame design must be readily machinable and must also have good forming and welding properties. Compensation should be made by increasing the thickness at the weld joints, because the design strength of a weld is generally taken lower than the strength of the original material. The stringer spacing should be designed so as to keep the skin from buckling at limit load, account being taken of the buckling data of the curved panel and also of the stabilising effect of the internal pressure.. "
What design feature is represented in the liquid-hydrogen tank structure used for a specific space vehicle stage?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22], shows a typical sidewall design used successfully for the liquid-hydrogen tank of the Saturn S-II stage.BS GEES SSS Numerical machine Paulht BEL Give SSS milled quarter-section afeeeihith HHT : AT Ht a 5 5 ep Swinger a ee aati Vertical weld ""3 Ge Insulation A L 3 Typical cylinder section qj { Curcumterential weld line "
What methods are employed to enhance the stiffness of a tank's skin?,"As has been shown above, the skin of a tank can also be stiffened by using integral ribs spaced in a grid pattern (either isogrid or rectangular waffle)."
"What fabrication techniques are commonly used to create rib stiffeners from thick plates, and which method is noted for its efficiency?",The integral rib stiffeners are usually formed by mechanical or chemical milling of the waffle pattern in a thick plate. Mechanical milling is more efficient than the other method [22]. The waffle structure is usually designed according to criteria of shell stability. Aluminium alloys are frequently used for the waffle plate material.
What is the orientation angle of the pockets in the propellant tank structure relative to the vehicle's longitudinal axis?,"A waffle design was used for the propellant tank structure of the Saturn S-IVB stage. The waffle pattern of the S-IVB consisted of pockets 241.3 mm on centre, which were oriented +77/4 rad with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. These pockets were surrounded by ribs which were 15.93 mm high and 3.658 mm wide. The skin or web thickness at the bottom of the pocket was 3.124 mm, and the weld land areas at the edges of these segments were 6.4 mm thick. "
What is the purpose of the machined waffle pattern in the propellant tank structure of the Saturn S-IVB stage?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [52], shows the propellant tank structure of the Saturn S-IVB stage and, in particular, the machined waffle pattern.

What are the advantages of an isogrid pattern compared to rectangular or square patterns in structural design?,"e ‘SEAL WELD art oom stucrott COMMON BULKHEAD OITA The isogrid pattern has the following advantages over the rectangular or square pattern: e high twisting rigidity of the structure, which distributes the loading over a wide region; © isotropic behaviour of the material, which has the same strength in all directions; and  e uncoupling of the bending and the in-plane resultants.. "
How does an isogrid pattern affect the analysis of a structure in relation to classical plate theory?,"Therefore, the isogrid pattern makes it possible to apply the many available solu- tions of the classical theory of plates. In other words, a structure stiffened by an isogrid pattern can be analysed as a solid continuous sheet of material having appropriate thickness and elastic modulus [49]."
What condition must be met regarding tensile and compressive stress to prevent buckling in a pressure-stabilised monocoque design?,"A monocoque structure stabilised by internal pressure has the lowest structural mass. This type of structure requires a material having a high tensile stress. Extreme care must be taken during manufacturing and transportation to avoid handling damage. In order to prevent buckling in a monocoque pressure-stabilised structure, the meridian tensile stress due to internal pressure must be greater than the meridian compressive stress due to external loads. "
What structural design has been utilized in the Atlas and Centaur launch vehicles as well as for the Space Shuttle's liquid-oxygen tank?,"This type of structure has been used for the Atlas and Centaur launch vehicles. It has also been used for the liquid-oxygen tank of the Space Shuttle, which is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [53].. "

How does the design of end closures influence the structural support and overall dimensions of storage tanks?,"The shape of the end closures of tanks affects their lengths and also the means used for structural stiffening, to an extent which depends on the materials chosen. A choice should also be made on whether using two separate closures or a common closure for two tanks stacked onto each other. Some surfaces of revolution, which have been analysed by computer subroutines for end closures, are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22]. "
What type of end closure shape was selected for the tanks of the Titan and Saturn S-IV vehicles?," Toroid Ellipsoid Sphere ' Sphere | ' | | | | ; t »\ ( H Na ] | H | Ellipsoid Modified ellipsoid Torispheroid Toroid ’ | | van | | | po: | +h Cassinian Shallow torispheroid Nontangent ellipsoid Sphere Biezeno Cycloid Spiraloid | | | 4 a > a A: ] Toricone Hemisphere Modified ogive In practice, end closures of hemispherical shape were chosen for the tanks of the Titan and for those of the Saturn S-IV. "
What structural design is utilized to withstand compressive forces in aerospace applications?,"Oblate spheroids were chosen for the Saturn S-IL, and ellipsoids were chosen for the Atlas, the Saturn I-C, and the Centaur [22]. A sandwich structure is used to resist buckling in the presence of compressive loads. Where only tensional loads exist, monocoque structures can be used. An example of honeycomb sandwich structure is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22].  Face sheet Adhesive ii) ire ST i Expanded core NS =a —a D ma Suh 1! al ila Fabricated Pe sandwich panel. "
What type of educational materials provide additional insights into sandwich structures?,Further information on sandwich structures is given in several textbooks. A short course on the matter can be found in [54].
What structural design approach is commonly utilized for the forward bulkhead of a tank to handle internal pressure?,"The forward bulkhead of a tank is usually a surface of revolution, convex on its external side, which is loaded principally by internal pressure. A thin skin subject to membrane stresses is the structural scheme generally used. Compressive stresses should be carefully determined, especially where the radius of curvature of the surface of revolution changes, in order to avoid circumferential buckling, and the results found analytically should be confirmed by tests.. "
What is the trade-off between shell thickness and stress management in structural design?,"To reduce mass, it is desirable to vary the thickness of the shell so that the bulkhead is subject to the maximum allowable stress along its meridians. On the other end, to reduce cost, it is desirable a shell of constant thickness."
What manufacturing technique is commonly used to create a bulkhead by joining a tank skin and welded triangular components?,"As has been shown in the preceding figures of this section, a bulkhead is generally manufactured by welding together an apical tank skin (also known as the dollar hatch) to a welded sub-assembly consisting of some triangular segments or gores. This method avoids the juncture of the multiple welds where the gore segments meet at a common point. "
What structural designs are commonly used for aft bulkheads in tanks?,"The aft bulkhead of a tank differs from the forward bulkhead only because some forces can act on it under certain conditions. For example, such forces act during the filling of a tank with a liquid propellant and during the propelled flight. Aft bulkheads are constructed by using sandwich or waffle structures. Engine feed-lines are usually located in the central part of a bulkhead, in case of a single engine.. "
What are the two methods for separating the fuel and oxidizer in a bi-propellant rocket engine?,"The fuel and the oxidiser of a bi-propellant rocket engine are separated by either two distinct bulkheads or one common bulkhead, according to the scheme shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22].Fuel 1 ' acanan Common ‘ bulkhead | Separate bulkheads | Oxidizer"
What structural designs are typically employed for self-supporting common bulkheads to withstand both bursting and collapsing pressures?,"A common bulkhead, if present, may be either self-supporting or pressure- stabilised. A common bulkhead of the self-supporting type must be designed for both bursting and collapsing pressures. Sandwich or waffle structures are generally used for this purpose. The forward surface of a common bulkhead is usually convex, as shown in the preceding figure."
"What types of joints are utilized for connecting a tank structure, specifically for propellant containment?",The attachment junctures used in a tank for propellants include:e weld joints; e bulkhead/sidewall juncture; and © bosses and support provisions.A brief description is given below for each of these elements.
What is the reason for increasing the thickness at weld joints in propellant tanks used for space flight?,"The principal welding processes used in space flight hardware have been described in Sect. 6.7. We describe here the weld joints used specifically in tanks for propellants. Since the strength of the material in the weld area is less than the strength of the original material, then an increase in thickness is necessary at the weld joints. The thicker weld land (tyeia > tskin) is usually asymmetrical on the two sides (external and internal) of the skin at a weld joint, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22]. "
What are the two types of weld land terminations described for aluminum alloys commonly used in propellant tanks?," skin d es | weld (a} Abrupt termination of weld land Step or taper _7 (b) Stepped or tapered termination of weld land This is because it is desirable to maintain a smooth external surface for aerody- namic reasons, and also because milling on the two sides of a weld land is more expensive than milling on one side only. The preceding figure illustrates two types, (a) and (b), of weld land for aluminium alloys 2014-T6 and 2219-T87, which are materials commonly used for propellant tanks. "
What is the range of the weld land thickness compared to the skin thickness?,"The thickness t,,.jq of a weld land is greater, by a factor ranging from 2 to 2.25, than the thickness f,4i, of the skin. The width d of a weld land ranges from 32 to 51 mm. The stepped or tapered termination (type b) of a weld land has the advantage, over the abrupt termination (type a), of avoiding bending stresses and strength reduction where the skin meets the weld land [22]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22], shows some pre-weld joint preparations which have proven satisfactory for tank design.  ' ! ; Burndown “J” groove {no filler weld rod). "
What manufacturing method is used to produce cylindrical sections of tanks without longitudinal welds?,"When possible, cylindrical sections of tanks are manufactured by spin forging, in order to eliminate longitudinal welds. Post-weld processing of tanks is limited to ageing, to relieve internal stresses caused by welding. This is because heat treat- ments after welding could induce distortion and oxidation, and also because complex equipment would be needed for that effect."
"What type of fitting, shaped like a Y, is utilized at junctures in tank structures?","Junctures are also needed in a tank between bulkhead and sidewall and between skirt and sidewall. These junctures are usually made at a common location with an appropriate fitting. A fitting commonly used is a Y-ring, so called due to its shape, which has been used for the Saturn I-C and for the Titan IL. A Y-ring fitting is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22].  Skirt er Skirt Tank ‘ bulkhead i ’ \ ~ Tank dome ’ ; ; Y-ring fitting N Initial ber size Y-ring fitting | ! 1! | i! Tank sidewall Tank sidewall Saturn 1C Titan il. "
What type of attachment method is utilized for the connection between the forward bulkhead and the sidewall in the specific rocket stage mentioned?,"A different type of fitting for the bulkhead/sidewall juncture is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22]. It was used for the Centaur rocket stage.Forward bulkhead Skirt attachment ting ‘ Tank sidewall ‘ ‘4 Aa ("
What function does a Y-ring fitting serve in relation to structural loads and leak prevention in a tank system?,A Y-ring fitting provides a structural path for the loads from the bulkhead to the tank and from the skirt to the tank. It also makes the tank leak-proof at the bulkhead/sidewall juncture.
What is the purpose of using bosses in the attachment of system components to the mounting structure?,"The system components and the tank mounting structure are usually attached by means of bosses. Such bosses are made deep enough to accommodate mechanical  fasteners, in order to avoid tank penetration. When the basic structure is of sufficient thickness, then the bosses are integrally milled with the basic structure. When the basic structure is a thin shell, then the use of integral bosses requires a material of larger initial thickness and a more extensive milling.. "
What effect does the welding process have on the material when fabricating a specific component by attaching a machined ring to a structure?,"Bosses can also be fabricated by welding a circular machined ring, containing the bosses, to the bulkhead. However, this method induces residual stresses in the material as a result of the welding process."
What is the reason for requiring a thicker material for machined fittings when welding to a tank's surface?,"Non-integral support provisions are machined fittings, such as ports, flanges, and support pads, which are welded to the tank skin. For this purpose, it is necessary to provide a material whose thickness is greater than the thickness of the tank skin, in order compensate for the loss of strength due to welding. Otherwise, for the same reason, it is necessary to lower the permissible operating pressure of the tank. "
What design feature is incorporated in liquid propellant tanks to prevent reverse flow and facilitate series feed-out?,"In tanks for liquid propellants, a single access opening is frequently used. This is obtained by using a close-out cover which contains the lines for input and output. When multiple tanks are connected in series, the inlet lines are connected to standpipes within the tanks, in order to preclude reverse flow of propellant and to ensure feed-out in series.. "
What are three types of structural features used for openings in tank designs?,"Openings and access doors are ports and access points in the skin of a tank. Three examples are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [22].——_ f+ ——— (a) Door with bearing lip : Door ring os ‘Spot weld | | Bulkhead membrane{b) Bulkhead boss with large cross-sectional area (c) Centaur torward door"
What is the purpose of the design features in access points for preventing leakage in rocket vehicles?,"Openings and access doors are usually located in or near the apex of a bulkhead. The primary requirements for these access points is the prevention of leakage during the entire service life of arocket vehicle. The method marked with (a) in the preceding figure uses a door with a bearing lip and oversized holes, in order to reduce rotation at the joint because of eccentric bolt shear loading. The method marked with (b) uses a bulkhead boss of large cross-sectional area, in order to force most of the load to remain in the bolting ring instead of going through the door. "
What design feature is utilized above the apex of the bulkhead for the forward entry of a specific rocket stage?,"The method marked with (c) uses a door ring placed above the apex of the bulkhead, and has been chosen for the forward door of the Centaur rocket stage.  References. "

An example is provided by the propellant-supply ducts which convey the fuel and the oxidiser from their tanks in a rocket stage to the respective turbo-pumps. These ducts employ flexible components (hoses, bellows, and joints) to permit freedom of movement during engine gimballing. "

What is the function of filters in the ducts of a liquid-propellant rocket engine?,"The ducts of a liquid-propellant rocket engine have often filters, which maintain the fluids at a desired level of cleanliness, by removing contaminant particles which such fluids may contain. A definition of the principal terms used in this chapter is given below. A line or duct is an enclosed leak-proof passageway through which a fluid is conveyed from one component of a rocket engine to another. "
What is the purpose of a flexible hose in fluid transfer applications?,"A bellows is a cylinder, corrugated along its sidewall, which may be enclosed in a line to permit movement by deflection of its corrugations. A bellows joint may be either a bellows with a restraint linkage or a free bellows alone. A flexible hose is a bendable duct used to carry or transfer a fluid from one point to another. A flange is a rib or rim placed at one end of a duct for attachment to another piece or duct. "
What is the purpose of a filter in the context of fluid management systems?,"A flange joint is an attachment of ducts, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together. A filter is a device which removes a contaminant from a fluid by . "
Under what conditions would flexible ducts be preferred over rigid ducts in a system installation?,"trapping particles of the contaminant within or on the surface of a porous material.According to Howell and Weathers [2], flexible ducts are considered for use insteadof rigid ducts under any of the following conditions:e existence of angular or lateral misalignment of the points to be connected;e necessity of removing ducts for repair or replacement;"

The following sections describe materials, construction, design criteria, and methods of calculation.7.2. Interconnecting Ducts and Structures in a Rocket"
What are the main requirements for ducts that transport fuel and oxidiser to turbo-pumps in an engine?,"Propellant-supply ducts convey the fuel and the oxidiser from their tanks to the respective turbo-pumps. These ducts, due to their location at the centre of an engine gimbal, are subject to bending and torsional loads. They are also subject to internal pressure, due to the fluids carried by them. The principal requirement for propellant- supply ducts is to keep the pressure losses between the tank outlets and the pump inlets to the minimum possible value. "
"What effect do internal restrainers have on pressure in ducts, and what challenge do external restrainers pose regarding duct size and interference?","As a result of the many forces acting upon these ducts, restrainers against buckling are frequently required. Such restrainers, if located inside the ducts, contribute to undesired pressure losses. On the other hand, the external location of the restrainers increases the duct size and may create problems of interference of the ducts with other components of the engine. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1], shows a bellows of the compressed type, externally restrained against buckling. "
What is the purpose of a device specifically designed to absorb torsional deflection in duct systems?," The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [1], shows an anti-buckling device designed to absorb torsional deflection in a pump inlet duct.

What is the maximum torsional rotation that the bellows assembly can absorb?,"The device shown above is a tightly formed bellows assembly, which was incor- porated into the pump inlet ducts of the J-2 engine, when the torsional moment of the ducts was found to be too high for the resistance of the pump casing. The bellows is thin-walled (0.254 mm) and over 2540 mm long. It has 40 deep corrugations stacked in a 31.75 mm height. Flanges encompass the bellows and permit the application of only torsional deflections. The joint is substantially a torsion spring of low elastic constant, which can absorb torsional rotations up to 2/60 rad or 3° [1].. "
What is the range of working relative pressure in pump-feed rocket engines expressed in N/m²?,"The manufacturer of a rocket vehicle must know the sizes of the connecting flanges, the types of gasket used, and the forces transmitted by the engine ducts to the vehicle when the engine is gimballed. This information is provided by the engine designer. In pump-feed rocket engines, the working relative pressure of propellant- supply ducts ranges from 0.3447 x 10° N/m? to 0.6895 x 10° N/m? and over. In pressure-fed rocket engines, the working absolute pressure of the propellant ducts is less than 3.447 x 10° N/m? [3].. "
What are the components that connect pump discharge outlets to main fuel valves in turbo-pump-fed rocket engines?,"In rocket engines fed by turbo-pumps, the high-pressure propellant ducts for pump discharge connect the outlet sections of the pumps (for respectively the oxidiser and the fuel) to the main fuel valves attached to the thrust chamber. These ducts also contain bellows components. However, some engines have also had rigid (instead of flexible) components, as shown in following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].. "

What material changes were made to the pump discharge ducts in early F-1 engines for flexibility and lower end reactions during misalignments and thermal effects?,"The early F-1 engines incorporated bellows joints in the pump discharge ducts, but these joints were later replaced by hard lines of aluminium with large bends for flexibility. The low modulus of elasticity of aluminium permitted lower end reactions for a given deflection than did a comparable duct of steel or nickel-base alloy. This change was possible because the ducts were not gimballing and were required to absorb only misalignments and thermal effects. "
What is the purpose of using flexible joints in wraparound duct arrangements for gimballing engines?," In case of gimballing engines, a classic configuration for pump discharge ducts is the wraparound duct arrangement, which is shown in following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].

What is the purpose of a flexible duct that conforms to the movement of a rocket engine's thrust vector control system?,"The term wraparound indicates a flexible duct or hose which, as it were, wraps around the thrust-vector-control gimbal of a rocket engine in the plane of the gimbal. This configuration was used for the Navaho, Atlas, Thor, and Jupiter engine pump discharge ducts, for the pump inlet ducts of the H-1 engine, for the gimballing feed lines of the Apollo Service Module engine, and for the descent engine of the Apollo Lunar Module. "
What design principle was utilized for the vehicle-to-engine connection lines in the F-1 engine and the main engines of the Space Shuttle?,"This configuration was also used for all of the vehicle-to-engine interface lines of the F-1 engine on the S-IC, except the main propellant lines. In addition, the wraparound concept was used extensively for each of the three main engines of the Space Shuttle. Details on the matter can be found in [1, 4].. "
What component is typically used to connect and support high-pressure propellant ducts in aerospace applications?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1], shows a typical pump- discharge high-pressure propellant duct with restraining linkage.  a= y— SPOOL PIECE laa pF» LL AT TTTLT fi J) FLANGE ws ety Re Bee | i Sy Vy ——.

What is the impact of long unsupported mass on vibration in duct systems with separated bellows?,The duct shown above has two bellows separated by a spool piece. This type of duct is subject to vibration of the long unsupported mass.
What type of linkage is illustrated in the figure used for thrust compensation in a rocket engine's oxidiser duct?,"The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [1], shows a bellows thrust- compensating linkage with external tie bar installed in the oxidiser high-pressure duct of the J-2 rocket engine."

What is the purpose of the external tie bar in relation to the bellows in the described system?,"This duct has an external tie bar which acts as a thrust compensator, and two bellows held together by the external tie bar, which limits the movements of the two bellows. One bellows opposes the other in balancing the pressure exerted by the propellant flowing in the duct."
What materials are commonly employed for connecting pressurisation lines to propellant tanks in aerospace applications?,"Pressurisation lines for the propellant tanks are used to connect the propellant tanks to sources of pressures, such as gases stored under pressure, gas generators, and heat exchangers for cryogenic propellants. For this purpose, high-pressure hoses and tubing are used. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [5]. shows two 6.35 mm, 34.6 MPa (relative pressure) flexible hoses, which were used for the Saturn I-B rocket stage.  a V4 < ae x (4 A ‘ ~~, AA yf 4. "
What is the purpose of using drain lines in systems with dynamic seals?,"Seal drain lines are often used in case of dynamic seals applied to the shafts or to other moving components of turbo-pumps. Since perfect sealing is difficult to obtain, then drain lines are used between two dynamic seals placed in series. The seal drain lines, which include flexible hoses and tubing, are routed away and overboard. In case of a combination of liquid oxygen with RP-1, the seal drain lines can be routed along the wall of the thrust chamber up to the exit plane of the nozzle. "
What is the routing purpose of seal drain lines in relation to propellant combinations during different flight stages of space vehicles?,"In case of combinations of propellants which can form highly explosive mixtures, these lines are routed to vent ports at the periphery of space vehicles. The seal drain lines are usually routed to the periphery of the vehicles during boost flight, and to the exit of the thrust chamber during stage operation [3].. "
What is the reason for routing seal drains of liquid hydrogen to a safe disposal location?,"Seal drains for liquid hydrogen are routed to a safe disposal area, because of the hazard of mixing liquid hydrogen with atmospheric air. Therefore, leaking hydrogen is not allowed to accumulate inside a rocket vehicle. For liquid-hydrogen turbo- pumps, the external drains are usually eliminated, and the seal leakage is allowed to vent into the turbine area, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [6], which illustrates a particular of the liquid-hydrogen turbo-pump used for the J2-S engine. "

What is the purpose of pneumatic supply lines in rocket propulsion systems?,"Pneumatic supply lines are used in rocket engines to provide pneumatic pressure required for several purposes. For example, as described at length in [4], the pneu- matic control assembly of the Space Shuttle provide central control of all pneumatic functions, such as: © engine preparation and shutdown purges; ¢ bleed valve operation; and © engine pneumatic shutdown, including pogo post-charge."
What factors influence the design of high-pressure flexible lines for gases stored in vessels prior to flight?,"The pneumatic pressure is provided by gases stored in vessels, which are charged before flight through high-pressure flexible lines. The design of such lines depends on the mating connexions on the vehicle side, on the type of gas used, and on its temperature and pressure."
What role do cryogenic-propellant bleed lines play during engine start conditions in turbo-pump fed systems?,"Cryogenic-propellant bleed lines are used in cryogenic-propellant engines feed by turbo-pumps. This is because adverse conditions for such engines may occur during start, when the metallic walls containing cryogenic fluids are at insufficiently low temperatures, and also when the cryogenic fluids downstream of the tank outlet are superheated. In addition, the pressure which opens the main valves and starts the turbo-pumps reduces further the static pressure at the inlet of the turbo-pumps, and this accelerates the production of gas. This, in turn, may lead to cavitation in the pumps and to malfunction of the gas generator.. "
What technique is employed to prevent undesirable events by replacing warming fluid with fresh liquid before engine activation?,"In order to avoid such undesirable events, a continuous bleed from a point farthest downstream of the pump inlet is applied before engine start. By so doing, fresh liquid at the bulk temperature of the tank replaces continuously the warming fluid and cools the metallic walls of the containers. The bleeds are ducted away from the launch site, because they can form combustible or even explosive mixtures. "
What type of hoses and tubing are commonly utilized for diverting excess fluids in specific propulsion systems?,"This  requires a line to duct away the bleeds. Wire-braided flexible hoses and tubing are generally used for such lines. In case of cryogenic-propellant engines used for upper stages of rockets, a re-circulation system is used, which re-directs the propellants to their tanks instead of dumping them overboard. Flexible lines between the engine and the rocket vehicle are required for this purpose. In order to reduce bleeds and re-circulating flows, it is possible to provide the rocket vehicle with means (such as cooling, thermal insulation, etc.) apt to keep the bulk temperatures of the propellants sufficiently below their boiling temperatures at the operating pressures in the tanks.. "
What gas is commonly used to execute purges in rocket engines to avoid combustible mixtures and remove leftover propellants?,"Purge lines are required for rocket engines. This is due to the necessity of performing purges during the start and shutdown sequence, and also before and after servicing, to keep the engines dry. These purges are executed by using non-reactive gases, such as nitrogen at ambient temperature, in order to prevent the formation of combustible mixtures, and to expel residual propellants."
What is the purpose of applying heated nitrogen to the space between an engine and its envelope?,"As an example, for the F-1 engine, a gaseous nitrogen purge is applied for thermal conditioning and for elimination of explosive mixtures under the engine envelope. Since low temperatures may exist in the space between the engine and its envelope for thermal insulation, then heated nitrogen is applied to this space. This purge is manually operated, whenever there is a prolonged hold of the countdown with liquid oxygen onboard and with an ambient temperature below approximately 286 K. This purge is turned off five minutes prior to ignition command and is continued during the time of umbilical connexion.. "
What is the role of nitrogen purging during propellant loading and flight in a turbo-pump system?,A continuous nitrogen purge is also required to expel propellant leakage from the seal housing of the liquid-oxygen turbo-pump and from the liquid-oxygen injector of the gas generator. The pressure of the purging gas improves the properties of the liquid-oxygen seal. This purge is required from the time at which the propellants are loaded and is continuous throughout flight.
What is the duration from the initiation of the nitrogen purge to the scheduled lift-off time in seconds?,A nitrogen purge prevents contaminants from accumulating on the viewing surfaces of the radiation calorimeter. This purge is started 52 s before scheduled lift-off time and is continued during flight.
What is the purpose of initiating a nitrogen purge in a liquid-oxygen system before engine operation?,A gaseous nitrogen purge is required to prevent contaminants from entering the liquid-oxygen system through the liquid-oxygen injector of the main engine or the liquid-oxygen injector of the gas generator. This purge is started prior to engine operation and is continued during the time of umbilical connexion.
What is the purpose of the ethylene glycol solution in the thrust tubes and manifolds before engine start?,"At approximately 13 h before scheduled lift-off time, an ethylene glycol solution fills the thrust tubes and the manifolds of the engine. This inert solution serves to smooth out the combustion sequence at engine start. Flow is terminated by a signal from an observer at the engine."
What volume is added to the system approximately 5 minutes before the scheduled launch to address liquid loss?,"At approximately 5 min before scheduled lift-off time, 186.3 1 (0.1893 m*) are supplied to top off the system to compensate for liquid loss which occurred during engine gimballing [7]."
What function do hydraulic ducts serve in systems designed for managing high-pressure liquids in rocket engines?,"Hydraulic ducts for high-pressure liquids are used in liquid-propellant rocket engines, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [7], which illustrates the outboard engine fluid system used for the five F-1 engines of the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V rocket.

"
How is hydraulic pressure generated for the flight control system after engine ignition in the S-IC assembly?,"The flight control system of the S-IC gimbals the four outboard engines to provide attitude control during the burn phase of the S-IC. For this purpose, the hydraulic pressure is supplied from a Ground Support Equipment (GSE) pressure source during test, pre-launch checkout, and engine start. When the engine starts, hydraulic pressure is generated by the turbo-pump of the engine."
What types of propellants are utilized as hydraulic fluid in the described fluid power system?,"Pressure from either source is made available to the engine valves, such as the main fuel and liquid-oxygen valves and the igniter fuel valve. These valves are sequenced and controlled by the terminal countdown sequencer, stage switch selector and by mechanical and fluid pressure means. Fluid under pressure also flows through a filter, shown in the preceding figure, and to the two flight control servo-actuators on each outboard engine. The fluid power system illustrated above uses both RJ-1 ramjet fuel and RP-1 rocket propellant as hydraulic fluid.. "
What is the purpose of check valves in separating pressure sources in hydraulic systems?,The RJ-1 is used by the Hydraulic Supply and Checkout Unit (GSE pressure source). RP-1 is the fuel used in the S-IC stage. It is pressurised by the engine turbo- pump. The two pressure sources are separated by check valves while return flow is directed to GSE or stage by the ground checkout valve. Drilled passages in the hydraulic components (valves and servo-actuators) permit a flow of fluid to thermally condition the units and to bleed gases from the fluid power system [7]. . 
What is the role of high-pressure hot-gas ducts in certain rocket engines with individual turbo-pumps?,"In most rocket engines feed by turbo-pumps, the gas generator is connected directly to the turbine inlet, and consequently no special ducts are necessary. In other rocket engines, high-pressure hot-gas ducts are required to connect the gas generator to the turbines. Such is the case with engines having two individual turbo- pumps. Still in other rocket engines, high-pressure hot-gas ducts are required to connect the tap-off ports of the thrust chamber with the turbine. "
What materials are used for high-pressure hot-gas ducts to withstand temperatures around 1200 K while accommodating deflections from thermal expansion and dynamic loads?,"Such is the case with engines (the J-2S, for one) based on the thrust chamber tap-off cycle, which has been described in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.7. High-pressure hot-gas ducts have rigid portions and also flexible portions, which are made of stainless steels and nickel-based alloys apt to resist temperatures up to about 1200 K. These ducts must be capable of absorbing deflections due to thermal expansion and also deflections due to misalignments and dynamic loads [3].. "
What is the primary purpose of a manifold in liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"Liquid-propellant rocket engines have ducts for the hot gases exhausted by the turbines. These gases may be ducted either to a region near the exit plane of the nozzle or to a manifold of the thrust chamber. By the way, a manifold is a duct having one or more branches off the main flow stream. Common types are T-shaped and Y-shaped manifolds. The main function of a manifold is to distribute flow from one or more inlet passages to one or more outlet passages. "
What is a common application of manifolds in liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"A typical manifold for turbine exhaust gas used in a liquid-propellant rocket engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].. "

What is the purpose of the manifold's design in relation to flow distribution among its branches?,"The manifold illustrated in the preceding figure is designed for equal distribution of flow. In other words, the flow areas inside the manifold are designed so as to split equally the flow among the branches. The gas exhausted by the turbine is dumped into the mainstream exhaust of the thrust chamber through an annular manifold. The cross-sectional area of the manifold decreases as it wraps around the thrust chamber,  in order for the gas to maintain a constant velocity as it is bled off through openings in the wall of the thrust chamber [1].. "
How are the turbines of the oxidiser and fuel turbo-pumps arranged in the J-2 engine to manage exhaust gas flow?,"In the particular case of the J-2 engine, the turbines of the oxidiser (liquid oxygen) and fuel (liquid hydrogen) turbo-pumps are connected in series by exhaust ducting which directs the discharged exhaust gas from the fuel turbo-pump turbine to the inlet of the oxidiser turbo-pump turbine manifold. One static and two dynamic seals in series prevent the turbo-pump oxidiser fluid and the turbine gas from mixing. "
How is the liquid-oxygen tank pressurized during burn periods in a turbo-pump system?,"Both turbo-pumps are powered in series by a single gas generator, which uses the same propellants as the thrust chamber. During burn periods, the liquid-oxygen tank is pres- surised by liquid oxygen flowing through the heat exchanger in the oxidiser turbine exhaust duct. The heat exchanger heats the liquid oxygen, causing it to expand. The liquid-hydrogen tank is pressurised during burn periods by gaseous hydrogen from the thrust chamber fuel manifold [7].. "
What type of diagram presents a detailed view of the main interconnected elements of the J-2 engine?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [8] is an exploded view of the principal interconnecting components of the J-2 engine."

What is the primary role of the thrust structure assembly in a rocket vehicle?,"Each stage of a rocket vehicle has a thrust structure assembly, whose principal function is to redistribute the loads applied locally by the engines into a uniform loading about the periphery of a tank (usually, the fuel tank). It also provides support for the engines, engine accessories, base heat shield, engine fairings and fins, propellant lines, retrorockets, and environmental control ducts. "
What type of engines propel the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle?,"The following figure, adapted from [7], shows the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This stage is propelled by five F-1 engines."
What material is used for the skin segments in the lower thrust ring of the Saturn/Apollo vehicle?,"The lower thrust ring shown in the following figure has four hold-down points, which support the fully loaded Saturn/Apollo (approximately 2.722 x 10° kg) and also, as necessary, restrain the vehicle from lifting off at the full thrust of the F-1 engines. The skin segments are made of 7075-T6 aluminium alloy."

What type of joint is used to connect the thrust chamber to the thrust structure in liquid-propellant rocket engines?,"In most liquid-propellant rocket engines fed by turbo-pumps, the complete engine assembly is gimballed by using a gimbal mechanism having a spherical joint, as has been shown in Chap. 5, Sect. 5.6. This joint connects the thrust chamber to the thrust structure (described above) of the rocket vehicle."
What types of loads do the mounts of a turbo-pump assembly need to support in a rocket engine?,"A turbo-pump structure is used to fasten the turbo-pumps to either the thrust chamber or other structural elements, such as the thrust structure. The turbo-pump mounts are the connexions between the turbo-pump assembly and the engine. These mounts support the loads due to the weight of the turbo-pump assembly and also react to the loads due to engine inertia, propellant inertia, engine gimballing, differences of pressure in fluids, forces on the flanges, and gyroscopic forces. "
What do the turbo-pump mounts accommodate in relation to the turbo-pump and thrust chamber assemblies?,"In addition, the turbo-pump mounts adapt to the differential thermal expansion or contraction of the turbo-pump assembly and of the thrust chamber assembly [9].. "
What are the advantages of using ball-ended struts in turbo-pump mounts regarding structural arrangement and thermal expansion?,"The most common types of turbo-pump mounts use struts having at least one ball- joint end connexion to accommodate dimensional tolerances and differential thermal expansion or contraction. Ball-ended struts can be arranged triangularly, to yield the lightest structure by loading its members in pure compression or tension. Another arrangement consists of close-coupled, rigid pads at one end of the turbo-pump, and one or two ball-ended struts at the other end to accommodate the dimensional variations [9].. "
What are the key advantages of using nickel-base alloys in rocket engine components compared to 18-8 steel?,"The 18-8 (18% chromium and 8% nickel) corrosion-resistant steels are the most frequently used materials for lines and bellows in rocket engines. Nickel-base alloys, such as those of the Inconel® and Hastelloy® families, are also used for ducts and bellows, because of their higher strengths, greater fatigue lives, and better corrosion resistances. Aluminium alloys are used in some non-critical or low-stress appli- cations. Due to forming requirements, only high-ductility alloys in the annealing condition are used for corrugated sections [1].. "
"What type of metal structure is used for making brackets designed to hold storable propellants, noted for its high strength?","Bellows-joint restraining brackets for cryogenic propellants are made of metals having face-centred cubic structure, which have high toughness at low temperatures. Restraining brackets for storable propellants are made of high-strength steels having body-centred cubic or face-centred cubic structure."
"What type of stainless steel is used in the construction of flexible hoses mentioned, and what additional element is incorporated for stabilization?","Flexible hoses, including wire braid, are made of 321 CRES, which is a stabilised austenitic stainless steel with addition of titanium."
What are the names of two alloys commonly employed in specialized environments?,"Other alloys, such as Hastelloy® C and Inconel® 718, are used for applications in special environments."
What criteria are important for selecting materials used in flexible components of fluid-carrying ducts in rocket engines?,"Materials used for tubing in rocket engines are chosen according to criteria of chemical compatibility with fluids, physical and mechanical properties, formability, weldability, and costs. These criteria have been considered at length in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.7 for propellant tanks. A brief account is given here for what concerns specifically fluid-carrying ducts and their flexible components. "
What factors influence ductility loss in metallic alloys exposed to high-pressure hydrogen?,"As to chemical compatibility of fluids with tubing materials, gaseous hydrogen at high pressure causes a loss of ductility in many metallic alloys. This effects depends on the temperature, pressure, and purity of the gas, and also on the exposure time and level of stress."
What is the effect of hydrogen exposure on the ductility of high-strength alloys compared to low-strength alloys?,"Ferritic, martensitic, and bainitic steels, nickel-base alloys, and titanium alloys become brittle when exposed to pure hydrogen at room temperature, this effect being higher at increasing pressure. High-strength alloys are often more susceptible than low-strength alloys to loss of ductility."
Which materials exhibit a high susceptibility to loss of ductility when exposed to gaseous hydrogen at elevated pressures?,"Austenitic stainless steels such as 310 and 316, some aluminium alloys such as 6061-T6, 2219-T6, and 7075-T73, pure copper and beryllium copper, and the precipitation-hardened stainless steel A-286 are slightly affected. Inconel® 718, Inconel® X-750, Waspaloy®, and René® 41 are highly susceptible to loss of ductility when exposed to gaseous hydrogen at high pressure [1]."
How does the presence of hydrogen and other gases influence the fracture mechanics in materials?,"The loss of ductility due to hydrogen is associated with a loss of fracture toughness. The presence of hydrogen, water vapour, and other gases increases the effects of crack initiation and crack growth rate."
"What substances, when present alongside hydrogen, can negatively impact metallic tubing by causing hot gas generation or corrosion of aluminum alloys?","In addition to hydrogen, substances which can have undesirable effects on metallic tubing are:e propellants susceptible to catalytic decomposition, such as anhydrous hydrazine, mono-methy]l-hydrazine, and Aerozine 50, which generate hot gas in the presence of molybdenum, iron, copper, or silver;© nitric acid resulting from absorption of water in nitrogen tetroxide, which attacks aluminium alloys;"
What type of corrosion can be induced in stainless steel 321 by certain cleaning fluid components?,"e chlorides from cleaning fluids, which can induce stress-corrosion cracking in stainless steel 321 CRES; and"
What type of environment can cause titanium to ignite and undergo explosive oxidation when impacted?,"e uninhibited (brown) nitrogen tetroxide, which can induce corrosion cracking in titanium alloys.It is also necessary to take account of the environment to which metals used for tubing are exposed. For example, titanium exposed to oxygen can ignite and oxidise explosively as a result of an impact."
What are the key physical and mechanical characteristics of metals that are important for tubing applications?,"The principal physical and mechanical properties of metals used for tubing are strength, elongation, and density."
What factors affect the toughness of materials with body-centred cubic structure at cryogenic temperatures?,Minimum bend radius and fatigue resistance are desirable properties in materials to be used for corrugated walls of bellows. Cryogenic temperatures reduce the tough- ness of most materials having body-centred cubic structure. Data of some metals and non-metals exposed to low temperatures (from 20.37 to 533.15 K) are given in [10].
What are the principal physical and mechanical properties of aluminum alloy 6061-T6 compared to titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V?,"Some materials used for flexible lines are aluminium alloy 6061-T6, stainless steel 321 CRES, Hastelloy® C, Inconel® 625, titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V annealed, and Inconel® 718 age-hardened. The principal physical and mechanical properties of these materials are given in Table 3, page 45, of [1]."
What properties must materials possess for flexible components in ducts to ensure durability and prevent leakage?,"The materials to be used for flexible parts of interconnecting ducts must be chosen with more demanding requirements than the materials for the remaining parts. Among these requirements, the most important are those of formability, and resistance to corrosion and fatigue. In particular, the materials chosen for bellows corrugations or  inner cores of flexible hoses must be ductile. Corrosion resistance is also required for these materials in order to avoid holes and cracks which can give rise to leakage. "
What materials exhibit favorable properties such as strength-to-weight ratio and elongation for applications requiring fatigue resistance in bellows?,"Fatigue resistance is required in order for a bellows to bear the desired number of flexural cycles. Materials which have shown good properties of strength-to-weight ratio, weldability, and elongation are Inconel® 718, Nitronic® 40 (a high-manganese stainless steel with high strength and excellent resistance to corrosion at high temper- atures), and 321 and 347 CRES. In particular, the Nitronic® 40 alloy is scarcely affected by loss of ductility due to hydrogen.. "
What types of metals are commonly utilized for fasteners in aerospace applications to resist corrosion?,"Bolts and nuts for aerospace applications are usually made of corrosion-resistant metals, such as Inconel® 718, Inconel® X-750, Monel® K-500, and René® 41."
What factors should be considered when selecting materials for fluid-carrying ducts to prevent failure?,"The materials indicated above for fluid-carrying ducts have generally good prop- erties of ductility, and therefore deform plastically under stress around the tips of cracks. However, particular conditions of either load or temperature can cause a loss of ductility, in which case a material may fail. Therefore, the choice of a possible material should take account of its fracture toughness and resistance to subcritical flaw growth, as has been shown in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.8.. "
Which materials are considered the most effective for forming elements in fluid-carrying ducts due to their resistance to corrosion?,"The formability of a given material depends on its ductility, that is, on its aptitude to form rolls, bends, fittings, and corrugations for bellows. Under this aspect, corrosion- resistant steels and nickel-base alloys have proven to be the best materials for all formed elements of fluid-carrying ducts."
"What are two methods used for joining elements of lines, particularly in welding applications?","The weldability of a material is important, because welding is the most used method of joining permanently various elements of a line. In case of flexible hoses, brazing is the most common method of connecting permanently the braid of a hose to each of the connecting points. Methods of welding elements of lines include tungsten-inert-gas (TIG) and electron beam, as has been shown in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.7.. "
What type of coating is utilized on corrosion-resistant steels to inhibit corrosion when lubricants are applied?,"Lubricants are sometimes used on the surfaces of bellows or other elements of lines. For this purpose, a corrosion-inhibiting type of molybdenum disulfide (MoS) coating can be used for corrosion-resistant steels. Nickel-base alloys resist better than steels to chemical attack. Plating or lubricants are also used on bolts and nuts to prevent thread galling. A thread lubricant used for the Saturn engine systems was a phosphoric-acid-bonded dry-film lubricant. Platings are used at temperatures higher than 422 K [1].. "
"What classification includes components that manage fluid flow within ducts, like disconnects, couplings, fittings, fixed joints, and seals?","The components described here are devices which contain and control the flow of fluids in ducts. These devices can be classified into the following categories: disconnects, couplings, fittings, fixed joints, and seals. A brief description is given below for each category."
"What are the main components of a typical separable connector used in a disconnect, specifically focusing on the locking mechanism?","A disconnect is a type of separable connector consisting of two separable halves, an interface seal, and usually a latch-release locking mechanism. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11], shows three stages of operation of a typical manually-operated disconnect.  LATCHING SLEEVE LATCHING BALLS LATCHING NOTCH sty ey INTERFACE SEAL (O-RING) DSK OSLER ."

What purpose do disconnects serve in the context of rocket vehicles and ground systems?,"Disconnects are used as interfaces between rocket vehicles and ground systems, or between stages of a rocket vehicle."
What type of connector utilizes multiple fasteners such as bolts or clamps to secure a mechanical joint?,"A coupling is a mechanically-actuated, separable connector which requires more than a few seconds for engagement or disengagement. Examples of couplings are threaded connectors, bolted flanges, and dynamic swivel couplings. A threaded connector is a line fitting which provides a separable mechanical joint secured by a single threaded nut, whereas a bolted flange connector uses several bolts, a clamp, or a combination of these to secure the joint [2].

What factors influence the selection between threaded and flanged connectors in regard to line dimensions and sealing requirements?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11], shows four types of threaded connectors.

ChE (c) Flared, with crush-gasket (4) Flareless conical seal The choice between threaded and flanged connectors is determined by the size of the line and by the amount of preloading required to establish a satisfactory seal over the entire range of loads [2]. "
What purpose do flanged connectors serve in relation to loads and coupling reliability?,"Flanged connectors are used where loads require the type of restraining force provided by bolts or clamps, or where coupling reliability dictates the use of more than one threaded clamping fastener [11]. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11], shows eight types of flanged connectors.  \ (a) Flat face (b) Flat face with seal cavity (c) Flat face with seal cavity in each face (d) Flat face with {e) Flat face with (f) Ring coupling swivel ring internal pilot (g) Raised face (h) Raised face with seal cavity. "
What is the primary function of a dynamic swivel coupling in a mechanical system?,"A dynamic swivel coupling is a joint designed such that the swivelling or rotary tubular shaft is pressure-balanced, so as to eliminate high sealing and bearing friction forces caused by axial pressure thrust [2]. On the Saturn engines, swivel couplings were used successfully between moving members of mechanical components (for example, valve stems, actuator shafts, and pistons). However, provisions were made to dispose of leakage, which is inherent in this type of coupling [11].. "
What are the different shapes of devices used to alter flow direction or area in a tubing or ducting assembly?,"Fittings are devices used to change flow area or direction while connecting two or more straight elements in a tubing, line, or ducting assembly. Such devices are the L-shaped, T-shaped, Y-shaped, et c. tubes used to route fluids to required areas. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11], shows (above) a low-pressure- loss fitting for joining tubes of different sizes, and (below) two types of tap-off fittings. "
What type of connections are characterized by permanence and prioritize low weight and high reliability in fluid-carrying systems?," MINIMUM MISMATCH ALLOWED i< AT THESE JOINTS INFLOW aed GN heceninmar => moked) a INFLOW ei osy ==, < RADIOGRAPHICALLY INSPECTABLE BUTT WELDS TAPOFF FLOW p> =, MAIN FLOW a % TAPOFF FLOW > ain comes MAIN FLOW () ""TAPOFF FLOW 2 TAPOFF << FLOW Fixed joints are permanent (that is, non-separable) connexions of fluid-carrying ducts. They are used when low weight and high reliability are more important than ease of separation [2]. "
What are the five methods commonly utilized for creating permanent connections between materials?,"The joining methods used for fixed joints are welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, soldering, and interference fit. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11], shows six types of welded joints used in tubing.  QZZZZZZZZZZZ A PAZZZZZEZLZA"") CLM ———~ SSS (a) Butt weld (b) Fillet weld. "
What type of welded joint combines fillet and sleeve techniques while eliminating internal and external crevices?,"(e) Sleeve weld with separate sleeve (f) Combination filletssleeve with separate sleeve (eliminates both internal and external crevices)With reference to the preceding figure, the butt (a), fillet (b), and sleeve (c) types of welded joints are very common. These three types are sometimes used in combinations, the most common of them being fillet and sleeve (f)."
What is the primary welding method commonly utilized for creating fixed joints in various applications?,"When possible, weld joints are located in areas free from vibrations. In particular, locations in which vibrations are perpendicular to the tube axis are avoided. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding is the most widely used of the joining methods for fixed joints. Gas Metal Arc (GMA) Welding is also used to join heavy sections, when it is desirable to reduce the number of weld passes needed to complete a joint. "
What is the primary advantage of using high-velocity electronic beams in specific metal joining applications?,"These methods have been described in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.7. Electron Beam (EB) Welding (a vacuum-based process in which a beam of high-velocity electrons is applied to the two metals to be joined) is applied in particular cases, for example, to join metals where a narrow weld bead or minimum heat input to the parts is necessary, or to join parts made of titanium alloys, which must be protected from oxygen.. "
"What is the primary mechanism through which bonding occurs in brazing, as opposed to melting the base alloy?","According to Howell and Weathers [2], brazing is a metal-joining operation performed at temperatures ranging between those of welding and soft soldering, where soft soldering temperatures are considered to be below 723 K. Brazing differs from welding, because in the former: (1) bonding results from wetting rather than melting the base alloy; (2) the brazing filler metal (brazing alloy) is made to flow into the joint by capillary action to create the bond; and (3) the brazing filler metal is an alloy having a composition different from that of the metals to be joined. Brazing filler metals used are often alloys of silver, aluminium, gold, copper, cobalt, or nickel.. "
What process allows for the creation of a joint between various materials through atomic diffusion under pressure and heat for a determined duration?,"According to Kazakov [12], diffusion bonding is a process by which a joint can be made between similar and dissimilar metals, alloys, and non-metals, through  the action of diffusion of atoms across the interface, brought about by the bonding pressure and heat applied for a specific length of time."
What are the titanium alloys commonly used for transition joints with stainless steel in diffusion bonding applications?,"Diffusion bonding has been used for a titanium-to-stainless-steel tubular transition section. These transition joints were developed to provide a fixed joint between titanium propellant tanks and stainless steel lines. Materials commonly diffusion bonded are Ti-5AI-2.5Sn or Ti-6A1-4 V alloys with 304L, 321, and 347 stainless steel. All titanium alloy-to-stainless-steel combinations have been used successfully [11].. "
What advantages do soldered joints offer for low-pressure applications compared to other metal-joining methods?,"Soldering is a metal-joining operation similar to brazing, but takes place with fillers (also known as solders) which melt at a temperature below 723 K.Soldered joints have been successful in low-pressure applications. They are light, require simple heating tools, can be assembled in a minimum envelope, do not need inert-gas shielding, and are readily made on in-place hardware [11]."
"What type of joint relies on pressure from one part against another, requiring force for assembly due to size difference between inner and outer diameters?","An interference fit joint, also known as tight fit connector, is a fastening between two parts which uses the pressure exerted by one of the parts against the other to obtain the desired result. For this purpose, the inner diameter of enveloping part (also known as the hole or the hub) is smaller than the outer diameter of enveloped part (also known as the shaft). Therefore, in order to fasten the two parts, it is necessary to apply force during assembly. "
What is the impact of pressure exerted by an enveloped part on the elastic deformation of an assembly with interference fit joints?,"After the parts are joined, the enveloped part exerts a pressure against the enveloping part along the mating surface, with consequent elastic deformation of the whole assembly. Interference fit joints without the use of some other joining method are not used in ducts for propellants, but are used sometimes in ducts for pneumatic or hydraulic fluids [11]. The definitions of the joining methods indicated above (welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, etc.) are rather intuitive than rigorous, for the sake of clarity. Formal definitions of such methods can be found, for example, in [13].. "
What are the two types of flange deflection that occur due to inadequate rigidity in aerospace vehicle tubing connections?,"Connecting flanges or glands for tubing used in aerospace vehicles should be rigid enough to maintain the integrity of static seals. Flanges should have the surface finish, the radial clearances, and the rigidity required by the specific seal used. Flanges having insufficient rigidity or inadequately bolted are susceptible to rotation under operational loads. Two types (bowing and rotation) of flange deflection due to lack of rigidity are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11].. "
What is the recommended approach for bolt arrangement in a flanged joint to maintain effective sealing and structural integrity?,"FLANGE ROTATION ' | «4 ae se > ane SS (a) Flange bowing (b) Flange rotation As a general rule, it is desirable to keep the bolt circumference of a flanged joint as close as possible to the seal, and to use rather many bolts of small diameter than a few bolts of large diameter. NASA [1] recommends the following design for a flanged joint."
What design feature minimizes rotation of flanges and acts as a thermal barrier in high-temperature duct applications?,"Contact here helps prevent flange rotation Small, closely =; ‘= spaced bolts = i ‘ml ul [Shy t Sleeve on inside of seal groove acts oucT as a thermal dam on hot ducts and also WALL prevents possible flutter of seal under flow conditions PRESSURE-ASS1STED STATIC SEAL"
What factors contribute to the reduction of pressure in tubing systems?,"7.5 Control of Pressure Loss in Tubing Causes of pressure loss in tubing are changes of flow direction, changes of flow area, changes of flow distribution, and friction between a flowing fluid and the walls of a duct."
How does the pressure loss coefficient for an elbow change as the ratio of bend radius to inside diameter increases after reaching a minimum value?,"As to the first cause, when the interfaces between the tanks and the pumps or between the pumps and the combustion chamber of a rocket engine do not permit rectilinear ducts, then elbow-shaped parts of tubing must be used. For a given Reynolds number, the pressure loss coefficient for an elbow decreases, reaches a minimum value, and then increases as the ratio R/D of the bend radius to the inside diameter of the elbow increases.. "
What methods can be employed to minimize pressure losses when using elbows with small bend radii in a line routing?,"When the routing of a line requires elbows of small bend radii, the consequent pressure losses can be reduced by either choosing the optimum value of the R/D ratio for each elbow, or adding flow guide vanes to the elbows, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].

What is the significance of calculating the natural frequencies of flow guide vanes in rocket engines to prevent resonance phenomena?,"Flow guide lines have been used in sharp elbows at the pump inlet ducts of the engines of the Centaur, Thor, Atlas, and Saturn S-IC. Such vanes have also been used in the pump discharge ducts of the Thor and Jupiter. The reduction of pressure losses improves the performance of a rocket engine. Since oscillations of the fluid can excite the flow guide vanes, then their natural frequencies must be calculated, in order to avoid resonance phenomena.. "
What components are commonly used in bellows to minimize friction-related losses in flow systems?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1], shows flow guide vanes used in elbows at the inlet ducts of centrifugal turbo-pumps.FUEL PUMP |] \) VANEO ELBOW INLET o> > ad TURBOPUMPS ~~ — SD OXIDIZER PUMP} af 2p, INLET => | Yy yIn bellows, flow liners are frequently used to reduce the high losses due to friction"
What should be the maximum included angle of a cone frustum in expanding conical ducts to minimize pressure losses?,"A change in flow area occurs frequently at the two ends of a duct. The shape of the transition portion near each end is to be determined in such a way as to prevent excessive pressure losses, which would take place in case of an abrupt change in flow area. For the same purpose, the edges of a duct at each end should be rounded instead of sharp. In case of expanding conical ducts, the included angle of the cone frustum should be less than or equal to 2/18 rad (10°). "
How does the inner diameter of a fitting influence pressure loss in small diameter ducts with threaded connections?,"For ducts of small diameter having threaded fittings, it is necessary to determine the pressure losses by taking account that the inner diameter of the fitting is usually smaller than the inner diameter of the duct.. "
What techniques can be employed to enhance flow distribution in ducts specifically for rocket engine components?,"The flow distribution at the exit of a duct (for example, at the exit of a feed duct for a rocket engine) is to be determined carefully because of its implications on the performance of the components. For example, when the pumps of a rocket engine have discharge ports placed oppositely, care must be taken in order to have equal pressure losses at the two ports. A flow distribution can be improved by using either flow guide vanes at the elbows, as shown in the preceding figure, or flow straighteners of the egg-crate type placed downstream of the elbows, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]..

What device was utilized in the Apollo Lunar Module's descent engine to ensure an even pressure loss across two ducts?,Another method of achieving a balanced distribution of pressure loss at the terminal ends of two ducts is based on a flow splitter. This method was used in the propellant feed lines of the descent engine of the Apollo Lunar Module.  Friction between the walls of a duct and the fluid flowing into it can cause large
What design features are essential for minimizing friction in ducts to reduce pressure losses?,"losses of pressure, in cause of ducts having rough walls. To reduce friction, it neces-sary to use ducts with smooth walls and to avoid protrusions into the flow stream,such as those which are sometimes caused by welds.The fundamental concepts on the longitudinal vibrations, called pogo vibrations, ofa rocket vehicle have been discussed in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9. The present paragraph"
What methods can be utilized to minimize vibrations effectively?,is meant to show in further detail how such vibrations can be suppressed by using
What are the functions of components integrated into the fuel supply pathways of rocket propulsion systems?,devices installed in the feed lines of rocket engines.
What causes the oscillations known as pogo vibrations in a rocket stage during propulsion?,"The pogo vibrations are due to a feedback interaction between the propulsion system and the structure of a rocket stage. These vibrations are generated by pulsa- tions in the thrust force, which cause a response in the structure. The structural response applies accelerations to the suction part of a propellant feed system. The two feed lines (for respectively the fuel and the oxidiser) respond separately to these accelerations, and cause pressure pulses at the inlet of the two pumps. "
What effect occurs when pulsating thrust feedback reinforces initial disturbances in the structure during propellant flow transmission?,"As a result of these pressure pulses, the pumps and the discharge lines transmit a varying rate of propellant flow to the combustion chamber. The combustion chamber, in turn, generates a pulsating pressure and a pulsating thrust. Instability occurs when the pulsating thrust is fed back to the structure, so as to reinforce the initial perturbation.. "
What method is implemented to reduce vibrations in the pumps of the Titan II?,"The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1], illustrates the vibration suppressing method used for the two pumps of the Titan II.  2 s Bi aI xe 5 é OIC | 32 ee EE | 58 é « 3 ote og g s 2 Sa AN REIED | | wer, BRS Vee sara €.

What type of mechanical arrangement was used in the fuel feed-lines to create a soft-spring effect for the accumulator?,"This bubble provided a cushion or a soft spring, which acted on the mass of the oxidiser in the standpipe. In this manner, the energy due to the pressure oscillations in the oxidiser feed-line was transferred to this spring- and-mass system, by choosing judiciously the volume or the height of the bubble enclosed in the standpipe. The fuel feed-lines had accumulators of the piston type, which used a mechanical arrangement comprising an helical spring and a piston to provide the desired soft-spring action. "
What factors contribute to the maximum possible reduction of pressure fluctuations in pump suction systems?,"The fixed mass of this mechanical arrangement and the mass of fuel in the accumulator provided the equivalent mass required for a resonant mechanical system. The oscillation suppression devices described above were designed and tuned so that their frequency responses, coupled with the feed-line  properties, would provide the maximum possible attenuation of pressure oscillations in the suction ducts of the pumps, as a result of the tank-structure oscillations. "
What is the function of the pressure transducer in the pogo suppression system of the Saturn V S-IC stage?,"The pogo suppression system used for the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle is shown in the following figure, adapted from [7].

The liquid oxygen pre-valve cavities are pres- surised with gaseous helium 11 min before scheduled lift-off time from ground supply by opening the pogo suppression valves. 
What instruments are used to monitor valve filling during the initial fill period before scheduled lift-off?,"During the initial fill period (from 11 to 9 min before scheduled lift-off time), the filling of the valves is closely moni- tored by using measurements supplied by the liquid level resistance thermometers R; (primary) and R2 (backup). The gaseous helium ground fill continues to maintain the cavity pressure until umbilical disconnect. After umbilical disconnect, the cavity pressure is maintained by the cold helium spheres located in the liquid oxygen tank. "
How many liquid level resistance thermometers are utilized in the monitoring of the system operation?,The status on the system operation is monitored through two pressure transducers and four liquid level resistance thermometers. One pressure transducer (0-5.516 MPa absolute pressure) monitors the system input pressure. A second pressure transducer (0-1.034 MPa absolute pressure) monitors the pressure inside the No. 1 engine liquid oxygen pre-valve cavity. The pressure readings are transmitted via telemetry to ground monitors. 
"What temperature condition indicates a ""wet"" reading from the liquid level sensors in the pre-valves?",The liquid level within the pre-valves is monitored by four liquid level resistance thermometers in each pre-valve. These thermometers transmit  a “wet” (colder than 108 K) and a “dry” (warmer than 108 K) reading to ground monitors [7].. 
What is the purpose of the pogo suppression system in liquid oxygen feed-lines for space vehicle engines?,"The following figure, also due to the courtesy of NASA [1], is a scheme of the pogo suppression system used in the liquid oxygen feed-lines on the main engines of the Space Shuttle."

What is the role of the accumulator in the liquid oxygen feed system for the turbo-pump?,The pogo suppression system shown in the preceding figure is incorporated in the feed system of liquid oxygen at the inlet of the high-pressure oxygen turbo-pump. This system uses an accumulator filled with gas to suppress flow oscillations induced by the vehicle. Gaseous oxygen is tapped off the heat exchanger in the oxidiser-tank pressurisation system. This gas is used as the compliant medium after an initial helium precharge. 
How is excess liquid oxygen managed in the accumulator within the system?,"The system controls the level of liquid oxygen in the accumulator by means of an overflow line, which routes overflowing fluids to the inlet of the low-pressure oxygen turbo-pump.. "
What is the frequency range of flow oscillations that the device helps to attenuate in the liquid oxygen circuit?,"The accumulator, which is shown in detail in Chap. 2, Sect. 2.9, serves as an attenuator in the flow of liquid oxygen in the circuit, and prevents the transmission of the flow oscillations (at frequencies ranging from 20 to 30 Hz) into the high-pressure oxygen turbo-pump. This system is designed to provide sufficient overflow at the maximum decreasing pressure transient in the discharge duct of the low-pressure oxygen turbo-pump. "
What is the primary function of the engine controller in terms of system monitoring and action?,"The engine controller (shown in detail in Chap. 5, Sect. 5.2) provides signals for valve actuation, and monitors the system operation [1].  7.7 Bellows Joints. "
What type of connector is defined as elastic and used for fluid conduction between points with various motions?,"According to the definition given by Howell and Weathers [2], a bellows joint is an elastic, corrugated, tubular connector used for conducting a fluid between points of relative angular, transverse, lateral, or combined motion."
What components are included in the construction of a bellows joint used to accommodate various deflections between connected systems?,"Bellows joints are used where axial, lateral, angular, or combined deflections exist between interconnected components of lines. A bellows joint in a line consists of the following parts:"
What is the purpose of restraints used on a flexible tube that functions under internal pressure?,"e a bellows, which is the flexible corrugated tube carrying the pressure exerted by the fluid conducted in the line;¢ restraints on the bellows, which prevent movements caused by internal pressure;"
What are the four types of motion that a flexible bellows joint can accommodate at its ends?,A bellows joint in a duct can absorb deflections with much smaller reaction loads than the loads in a hard line. A free bellows can absorb four types of motion applied to its ends: (a) axial motion due to tension or compression forces; (b) offset motion with end planes parallel; (c) angular motion about its centre; and (d) torsional motion about its axis.
What type of motion does a gimbal ring linkage specifically allow a bellows to absorb?,"Various restrains or linkages can be used in order for a bellows to absorb only certain types of motion. For example, a gimbal ring linkage allows a bellows to absorb only angular motion. An internal (left) and an external (right) mounting of gimbal rings for a bellows joint are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]. Other drawings showing bellows joints mounted on gimbals or hinges can be found in [14].. "

What happens when vibration-induced stresses surpass the fatigue limits of the material used in engine components?,"the fluid conducted in the line or mechanical parts of the engine. The frequencies of  these vibrations are of the order of magnitude of several thousand hertz. When the stresses resulting from such vibrations exceed the fatigue limits of the material of which a bellows is made, then failure occurs."
What is a common characteristic of bellows used in rocket engine ducts regarding the material behavior during operation?,"Bellows are used for ducts of rocket engines in various sizes and operating condi- tions. A bellows operates usually in the plastic range of the material of which it is made. This is because the necessity of reducing weight implies small values of thickness for the bellows walls, provided that the magnitudes of the reactions at the bellows ends are acceptable. A formed bellows with straight corrugated sidewall is the type most frequently used for rocket engines.. "
What are the two categories of pressures that a bellows must manage during its operational state?,The types of pressures to be carried by a bellows in operating conditions are: © normal operating pressure; © surge pressure;
What occurs to the velocity head and pressure head of fluid in a line when a valve is closed rapidly?,"By surge pressure we mean the variation of pressure which occurs in a line conducting fluid as a result of a change in the flow velocity. This variation of pressure may occur in a line, for example, when a pump starts or stops, or a valve is opened or closed rapidly, or the diameter of the line changes abruptly. When a valve is closed rapidly, the velocity head of the fluid moving forward in a line decreases whereas its pressure head increases suddenly, due to the compression which occurs upstream of the valve. By proof pressure we mean:. "
"What is the formula for calculating proof pressure in relation to normal operating pressure, surge pressure, and safety factor?",proof pressure = (normal operating pressure + surge pressure) x safety factor
"Define the term that refers to the pressure at which a material fails due to rupture, considering variations in properties, manufacturing quality, and load distribution.","As has been shown in Chap. 6, Sect. 6.9, the safety factor is a multiplier, whose value (greater than unity) is chosen by the designer to take account of small variations of the properties of the material, of the quality of manufacturing, and of the magnitude and distribution of the load. Finally, by burst pressure we mean:"
What types of stresses must a bellows accommodate during proof and burst pressure applications?,"These pressures generate hoop (circumferential) stresses and bulging (meridian) stresses, which must be carried by the corrugated sidewall. A bellows must resist column buckling under application of proof pressure. Under application of burst pressure, a bellows is permitted to deform and take permanent set, but not to leak. The limiting bulging stresses and allowable motion stresses (bending stresses) of materials frequently used for bellows are given in the following table, adapted from [1]. "
What is the relationship between sheet thickness and material properties reduction due to surface finish and thickness variation?," Material Material Limiting bulging stress*, MPa Allowable motion stress, condition MPa t < 0.3048 mm | t > 0.3048 mm | 1000 cycle | 10000 cycle life life 321, 347 CRES | Cold worked as | 965.3 827.4 827.4 510.2 formed Re 10-40 A-286 Heat treated; R, | 1379 1103 1379 827.4 29-40 Inconel 718 Heat treated, R, | 1379 1103 1448 930.8 38-45 Inconel X-750 | Heat treated.

"
What are the main factors contributing to issues encountered in bellows joints utilized in ducts?,The principal causes of problems affecting bellows joints used in ducts for liquid-e manufacturing difficulties; and e handling damage.
What factor contributes to the large deflections experienced at the ends of flexible components in a mechanical system?,"As to fatigue, bellows are subject to large deflections at their ends, due to the offset motion cited above. Bellows have usually thin walls, in order to reduce weight. Consequently, the materials of which bellows are made operate under stresses near or in the plastic range, with resulting low fatigue lives."
What methods can be employed to predict vibratory stresses in systems subject to vibrations from fluids or mechanical parts?,"Bellows are also subject to vibrations, caused by the fluids or by mechanical parts. They must be designed so that no reduction in fatigue life is caused by vibration. In order to predict vibratory stresses, it is possible to use known vibration inputs relating to other engines in the same conditions, and compare such inputs with the frequencies of resonance of the given ducts, which can be calculated. "
What happens to the fatigue life of a bellows when it operates at excitation frequencies that align with its natural frequencies?,"Otherwise, it is possible to construct a prototype and test it on various engines, while the vibration environment is measured. When a bellows operates at excitation frequencies matching any of its natural frequencies of vibration, then its fatigue life can be exceeded in a short interval of time.. "
What is the common failure type in bellows that leads to fluid escape through their structure?,"The most frequent failure mode for a bellows is a fatigue crack, which gives rise to leakage through the corrugated wall. The cracks develop circumferentially in areas of maximum bending stress, which are the crowns and the roots of the corrugations. "
What is the description of the individual convolution mode concerning the movement of corrugations?,"(c) the individual convolution mode, in which the individual corrugations rotate back and forth at the inner diameter, and pivot about the outer diameter."
What factors influence whether the individual convolution mode in braided hoses is in phase or out of phase during vibrations?,"In particular, the individual convolution mode occurs often in vibrations of braided hoses caused by flow oscillations, where the outer diameter of the corrugations is restrained by the braid friction, and consequently the outer point of each corrugation is a fixed pivot point for the corrugation excited by flow forces. The individual convo- lution mode may be in phase or out of phase, depending on how each corrugation moves with respect to the others.. "
What are the three primary modes of vibration identified in the study of mechanical systems?,"The primary modes of vibration (a), (b) and (c) described above are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].—— EXTENSION THT ER Ue AL alti : +] N et : ys. ol af N | a an ehennl NT =, ' COMPRESSION Mee Pa 1 (a) AXIAL OR ACCORDION ~ Oe (>) LATERAL IN-PHASE OUT OF PHASE (c) INO VIDUAL CONVOLUTION"
What is one method to prevent fatigue stresses in flexible flow lines caused by vibrations from high-velocity fluids?,"Bellows incorporated in flexible flow lines are frequently subject to vibrations induced by fluids moving at high velocity, with consequent failure due to fatigue stresses. This type of failure is avoided by using internal flow liners, which prevent the flow stream from impinging on the corrugations. However, care must be taken, because internal flow liners, too, may be subject to flow-induced vibrations.. "
How can the natural frequencies of bellows be effectively designed in relation to the frequencies of exciting vibrations from engine components?,"Bellows are also subject to vibrations induced by mechanical parts of engines. When the frequencies of the exciting vibrations are known, for example, through measurements, then bellows can be designed so that their natural frequencies should not match the excitation frequencies. "
"What types of instability can result from excessive pressure on bellows, and how do internal and external pressures differ in their effects?","Bellows may be subject to buckling due to excessive internal or external pressure. Buckling due to high internal pressure results in column instability, whereas buckling due to high external pressure results in crushed corrugations. Buckling can occur only when the pressures in actual operating conditions are beyond the pressures predicted in the original requirements."
What type of corrosion vulnerability is associated with stainless steel 321 CRES used in bellows due to its elemental composition?,"A bellows may be subject to corrosion, depending on the material of which it is made. A material commonly used for bellows is stainless steel 321 CRES, which is resistant but still susceptible to corrosion, because of its high percentage of iron. This and other materials have been discussed in paragraph 3."
What are the main challenges encountered during the production of bellows?,"The principal difficulties in the manufacturing of bellows are material thinning, heat-treatment control, welding, and convolution stack-off."
"How does the reduction in wall thickness at bellows corrugation crowns affect the deflection, stiffness, and fatigue resistance of the material?","Bellows are thinned at the corrugation crowns, about 5% or 10% below the nominal thickness of the wall. As a result of this thinning, higher deflection takes place in the thinned section, because its stiffness is reduced, and consequently higher stresses and lower resistance to fatigue can occur."
What factors must be controlled during the heat treatment of bellows to prevent performance degradation and ensure adequate strength?,"Heat treatment of bellows is controlled in order to avoid degraded performance caused by improper treatment. In particular, this control requires the maintenance of the proper gaseous environment during heat treatment, to avoid oxidation and consequent strength reduction."
What method can be employed to prevent issues related to welding quality?,Welding problems are due to insufficient quality control. Such problems can be avoided by inspecting radiographically all welds.
What term describes the relative offset between convolutions or corrugations in bellows?,"Convolution stack-off is the eccentricity of convolutions or corrugations of the bellows with respect to each other. Since this eccentricity depends on the tools used in the process of fabrication, then all of the eccentricity is accumulated in the same direction, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]."
What method can minimize alignment issues when welding bellows into assembly by addressing accumulation during the stacking process?,STACKOFF (ECCENTRICITY) OVERALL f \ LENGTH OUTSIDE DIAMETER CONVOLUTION STACKOFF Convolution stack-off makes it difficult to align the bellows for welding into its next assembly. This accumulation can be controlled by rotating the bellows after the forming of each convolution.
What is the significance of employing protective tools during the assembly and handling of bellows with wall thicknesses of 0.762 mm or thinner?,"It is necessary to use handling-protection devices in the duct assembly and during processing, shipping, and installation of bellows. This is particularly important in case of bellows having thin walls (less than or equal to 0.762 mm)."
What is the purpose of strong-back fixtures in relation to bellows joints within ducts?,"In order to protect the bellows joints incorporated in a duct from over-deflection, it is necessary to use strong-back fixtures which attach to the duct on either side of each bellows joint and form a protective bridge around it. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1], shows (right) a strong-back fixture and (left) a shell-type cover for protection of bellows."

What are three other types of restraints used for bellows joints besides the one mounted on gimbal rings?,"As has been shown above, the most common type of restraint used for bellows joints is the one mounted on gimbal rings. Other types of restraint are the hinged joint, the ball joint, and the braided wire sheath."
What types of loads can the gimbal-ring joint be designed to withstand?,"The gimbal-ring joint can be designed to withstand high pressures and temper- atures. It can also withstand torsional loads and absorb angular deflections in all planes. Excessive angular motion of the bellows can be prevented by means of stops, and the pivot pins which carry the loads can be designed for either single-shear or double-shear support. The same considerations apply to the hinged joint, which allows angular motion in only one plane.. "
What is the purpose of using a solid dry-film lubricant on both the outer surface of the bellows and the inner surface of the braid in tension-tie restraints?,"Another type of external, tension-tie restraint is a braided wire sheath, as is the case with a flexible hose. A joint of this type can absorb both angular and shear deflections. It also acts as a vibration damper for the bellows. Friction between the braid and the bellows can be reduced by using an adapter, which provides clearance at the end of the corrugations, and by applying a solid dry-film lubricant on the outer surface of the bellows and on the inner surface of the braid.  The lubricants used for this purpose must be compatible with liquid oxygen, when. "
What type of joint is utilized for low-pressure ducts in gas turbines and is characterized by variable pivot points?,"this is the fluid conducted through the given line. A link joint with internal tie restraint can be used instead of a gimbal joint when a duct is subject to small or medium pressures. It is used frequently in low-pressure ducts of gas turbines. It has de disadvantage of high friction losses, due to the restric- tion to flow in the frontal section. In particular, a chain-link joint is a link joint in which the pivot point of the linkage is not fixed, but depends on the plane in which the joint lies. A chain-link joint with internal tie restraint is shown in the following. "

What type of motion does the bellows joint provide while accommodating a uniform load at the pump flange?,"The bellows joint using the restraint illustrated in the preceding figure was located immediately upstream of the pump inlet flange, due to the large pressure separating load. This joint could provide a restraint and a motion of the gimbal type while applying a uniform circumferential load to the pump flange."
What type of fuel does the RS-25 engine utilize in its combustion process?,"The flexible joints used for the RS-25 engine (burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen) are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [4]."

What is the primary function of the flexible joints in the RS-25 engine's lines?,"The flexible joints in the lines of the RS-25 engine allow movement for vehicle steering, while maintaining the internal pressure and temperature in the lines. These joints must be flexible, because the lines connect either the gimballed engine with the vehicle or the gimballed engine with non-gimballing components. "
What structural benefit do multiple thin plies provide in a metallic bellows compared to a single thick metallic sheet?,"A flexible metallic bellows is used as the pressure vessel. This bellows has each of its ends welded into a section of fluid ducting, in order to provide a continuous, leak-proof pathway. The bellows have several thin plies in a sandwich configuration, instead of a single thick sheet of metal. This arrangement makes the bellows more flexible and maintains integrity against pressure."
What is the purpose of the gimbal joint in maintaining the structural integrity of a duct under internal operating pressure?,"The ducts which contain flexible joints internally tied have an internal diameter large enough to allow an internal support mounted on gimbals. This internal support arrangement saves weight in comparison with an external support. Were it not for the gimbal joint, which holds both ends of the flexible joint together, the internal operating pressure of the duct would expand the flexible bellows longitudinally like an accordion. "
What type of joint is described that allows for flexible movement and includes a gimbal ring centered over bellows?,"The joint of the internal gimballed support is of the ball-and-socket type. Ducts with small internal diameters use an internal gimbal ring to restrain the bellows. The ends of the flexible joint are attached to the gimbal ring (which is centred over the bellows) at two points, so as to form a universal-type joint.. "
What function does the liner in flexible joints serve regarding the flow of propellant through the duct?,"The flexible joints contain an integral flow liner. This liner prevents the propellant flowing through the duct from impinging on the corrugations of the bellows, which could cause turbulence in the flow and vibrations in the materials. The liner is made up of two or three overlapping pieces. The outside ends of the end pieces are welded into the flexible joint, so as to form a continuous, smooth internal diameter when the flexible joint is welded into a duct. "
What design feature enables the joint's flexibility while allowing propellant to occupy the space between two components?,"The overlapping portions of the liner are shaped as a truncated ball and socket, to allow movement of the flexible joint. The liner allows propellant to fill the space between it and the bellows. Screened ports at the upstream ends of the flow liner provide a path for propellant to exit the space behind the liner after engine shutdown [4].. "
What types of flexible joints are utilized in the RS-25 engine for its low-pressure discharge ducts?,"The flexible joints used in the RS-25 engine are the internal tripod and the external-gimbal ring joints. The internal tripod joint is used for the low-pressure discharge ducts, where the pressure loss can be tolerated and the overall joint enve- lope must be kept as small as possible. The following figure, due to the courtesy of Boeing-Rocketdyne [4], shows the internal tripod joint non-jacketed (left) and jacketed (right).. "
What materials are specified for the joints and what is the operational pressure mentioned for the low-pressure discharge duct?,"SY NN — / F 2 TZ x \ \ ” r) \ 2 , i! <— } ry Ril!  According to the data given in [4], these joints are made of Inconel® 718 and ARMCO 21-6-9 stainless steel, and their design life is 200 operational, 1400 non- operational full deflection cycles. The non-jacketed joint is used for the low-pressure discharge duct of the oxidiser. It works at an operating pressure of 2.916 MPa and at an operating temperature of 92.04 K. "
What is the inside diameter in millimeters of the component used for the low-pressure discharge duct?,"Its inside diameter is 160 mm, and its angular displacement is 0.2269 rad (+13°). The jacketed joint is used for the low-pressure discharge duct of the fuel. It works at an operating pressure of 1.924 MPa and at an operating temperature of 22.04 K. Its inside diameter is 132 mm, and its angular displacement is +0.2007 rad (+11°30’). The externally-tied gimbal ring joint used in the RS-25 engine is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]. "
What is the maximum diameter of the ducts where the specified joint is utilized in the RS-25 engine?,"[ SIMBAL RING PIN (TYP.) + EXTERNAL GIMBAL RING PV a Jo! wa 4 . s >< Ys A / {WELD ATTACHMENT TO DUCT TOTAL ANGULAR SS VATA a a DEFLECTION OF JOINT eee > a < | FS “FARR pe SAS CENTER OF BALL JOINT IN BELLOWS ASSEMBLY ANGULAR DEFLECTION OF EACH BELLOWS This joint is used in the RS-25 engine on small-diameter (50.80-68.58 mm) high- pressure ducts, where the pressure losses associated with internal ties are not accept- able. "
What mechanism is employed to stabilize the externally-tied joints in the presence of high pressures and specific gimbal angles?,"The high pressures and gimbal angles of the externally-tied joints make it necessary to use long bellows, which are unstable in column buckling.  This joint is stabilised by a linkage, shown in the preceding figure, which provides. "
What is the effect of adding lateral support at the mid-point of a flexible assembly on the angular deflection distribution?,"lateral support at the mid-span of the bellows live length. By so doing, the angulardeflection of the joint assembly is equally distributed between the two bellows."
What is the purpose of the flexible joint that incorporates a gimbal ring and crossed bars in the Shuttle Orbiter's drain ducts?,"A flexible joint with linkage restraint known as “Gimbar” (gimbal ring with crossed bars for structural strength) is used in the fuel and oxidiser drain ducts of the Shuttle Orbiter. This joint is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]."

What type of joint is designed to accommodate large diameter ducts carrying low-velocity fluids while managing torsional loads through its linkage mechanism?,"This joint is lighter than a gimbal ring joint having internal or external ties, and can be used in ducts of large diameters carrying fluids moving at low velocities, in which the pressure loss due to the structure across the flow stream can be tolerated. This joint is also capable of carrying torsional loads, by means of its linkage."
What is the purpose of thrust-compensating bellows in a system involving primary bellows?,"Thrust-compensating bellows are sometimes necessary to offset the thrust of primary bellows. An example of thrust-compensating bellows is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].  le ” "" fm 7 Uy Ag ~~ Be Nyt it Wr ” J Li ~; eS “ ae v 3 an bi es 2 -"
What must be balanced to compensate for axial thrust in a thrust-compensating bellows system?,"In a thrust-compensating bellows, the axial thrust due to the pressure separating force is balanced by the compensating bellows. Of course, in order to compensate for thrust, the volume of the bellows must also be compensated."
What issues do volumetric changes in straight-run ducts cause during engine operation?,Thrust-compensating bellows also eliminate volumetric changes which occur in straight-run gimballing ducts. Such changes cause pressure perturbations which are detrimental to engine operation.
What component is used in the duct at the pump's inlet to counteract the separating force?,"In the duct at the inlet of the pump of the F-1 engine, a bellows (which is external to and concentric with the main bellows) offsets the separating force of the main bellows, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]."
What is the relationship between the areas of two concentric bellows in terms of their annular chamber design?,"CONCENTRIC BELLOWS Aetraley ested nadan around cifcumference 7 UUUU _ ba ca a i ~ AAA area A, = 2 x area A,The annular chamber is vented to internal duct pressure. Axial-tension rods tie across the bellows alternately along the circumference. Telescopic flow sleeves can also be provided [1]."
What role do bellows joints play in a compression system regarding the absorption of duct deflections?,"Bellows joints are also used in compression systems. A compression system consists of one or more bellows having no tension ties, which are used to absorb the deflections of a duct in operating conditions. In a compression system, the mating structure of the engine reacts to the pressure separating forces and to the elastic forces due to the fluid moving in the duct. The reaction exerted by the mating structure places the duct in compression. "
What effect do eccentric pressure separating forces have on the structural integrity of bellows in low-pressure ducts of engines?," In engines having ducts with compression-restrained bellows (for example, low- pressure ducts, such as those at the outlet of turbines), the support structure of the engine can be overloaded with moments caused by eccentric pressure separating forces acting on the bellows. These moments cause shear stresses in the bellows.. "
What is the significance of installing a bellows with a bias to achieve nearly neutral deflections during operational conditions?,"When the deflections induced in a bellows in operational conditions are known, then that bellows con be installed in an engine with a bias which gives rise to opposite deflections. By so doing, the bellows move, when placed in operational conditions, toward a nearly neutral position, corresponding to little or no stress. An installation of a compressed-restrained bellows made according to this criterion is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].. "

What techniques are advantageous for joining components of varying thicknesses and different metals?,"As has been shown above, bellows are made of thin, sometimes laminated, and often dissimilar materials. Consequently, junctions between bellows and adja- cent parts of higher thickness require the use of careful manufacturing techniques. Electron-beam welding and diffusion bonding (discussed in paragraph 4) offer advan- tages over other techniques when parts made of dissimilar metals and having different thicknesses are to be joined.. "
How can bellows of heat-treatable materials be connected to non-heat-treatable ducts without affecting heat treatments in the bellows?,"Bellows made of heat-treatable alloys can be welded to ducts made of non-heat- treatable alloys without disturbing the heat treatments in the bellows materials. For this purpose, a transition portion of the duct is welded to the bellows before heat treating the bellows material, so that the final weld to the duct involves identical alloys."
What are the two primary types of welds used to connect the bellows to the ducts in the RS-25 engine?,"In the RS-25 engine, the welds of the bellows to the ducts are of two principal types:"
What type of welding is used to join the necks of thin-wall bellows before further processing?,"(a) welds for thin-wall bellows subject to low pressures; and  (b) welds for thick-wall bellows subject to high pressures.The necks of the thin-wall bellows are resistance-welded together, then trimmed around the circumference through the centre of the nugget. The bellows is then electron-beam welded to end rings, and the resultant assembly is heat treated."
What are the primary classifications of welds typically utilized in welding processes?,"The two types of welds indicated above are shown in the following figure, adapted from [1]."
What are the pressure classifications for bellows based on their resistance to low and high pressure?,BELLOWS PLIES (4 x 0.6096mm INCONEL 716 ASSEMBLY HEAT TREATED TREATED ‘uct ATTACHMENT out POINT ATTACHMENT POINT CRION: 79!

What is the purpose of implementing internal flow liners in bellows related to fluid streams?,Internal flow liners or sleeves for bellows are used to solve the problem of fatigue failures of bellows. Such failures are due to vibrations induced by the fluid stream. Flow liners are also used to reduce the pressure losses which occur at the joints. Flow liners have been used as structural members supporting tube coils in heat exchangers mounted on the J-2 and J-2S engines.
What design considerations prevent flow liners from interfering with bellows or ducts during maximum movement?,"Flow liners must be designed so that they should not bottom out or bind on either the bellows or the ducts, when the bellows are at the maximum limits of excursion. They must also be designed with drain holes placed as near as possible to the weld attachment, in order to make it possible to remove cleaning fluids and contaminants."
What has been done to address the issue of cracking in flow liners at the trailing edge and weld joint?,"Fatigue failures of flow liners have occurred, in which cracks have appeared in the trailing edge and in the weld joint. These failures have been attributed to vibrations of the cantilevered end of the sleeve. This problem has been solved by an increase in the thickness of the wall, with a consequent increase in the rigidity of the liner [1]."
What is one method to mitigate pressure differences in liners caused by sudden flow rate changes?,"Collapse of liners has also occurred as a result of pressure on the outer diameter of the liner exceeding that of the inner diameter. This has been attributed to sudden changes in flow rates, which cause a different static pressure across the wall of the liner. Vent holes in the liner can reduce some of this difference of pressure, Otherwise, the liner can be strengthened to withstand the applied load.. "
What are the three main components of a flexible hose as described in the provided material?,"Some typical configurations for flow liners are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].

"
Why are flexible hoses preferred in large liquid-propellant rocket engines compared to small engines that utilize storable propellants?,"Flexible hoses are used more often in large liquid-propellant rocket engines (meant for boosters and upper stages) than in small engines (meant for attitude control or reaction control). This is because little flexibility is required in lines of small engines, which are not mounted on gimbals and use storable propellants."
What is the reason for the flexibility of the fluid-carrying lines in rocket engine systems?,"The J-2 and F-1 engines (both of which have been used in the Saturn V launch vehicle) have many fluid-carrying lines between the engine and the vehicle. These lines are flexible, in order for the engine to be moved on gimbals."
What is the attachment method for hoses on the F-1 engine concerning the gimbal plane?,"On the J-2 engine, all the lines are flexible hoses and are clamped together to assist in maintaining their relative positions.On the F-1 engine, the flexible hoses cross the gimbal plane and are attached to non-gimballing flexible hoses on the engine [1]."
What is the maximum diameter allowed for coiled tubes used in pneumatic lines and tank pressurisation according to the specified application?,"Coiled tubing is sometimes used in heat exchangers for tank pressurisation. This is done in order to provide the maximum area possible for heat transfer in the minimum space. In the Centaur stage, a coiled tube is used for the pneumatic lines to the main engines, and flexible bends in lines for propellant recirculation and in lines for tank pressurisation, all of which are less than or equal to 25.4 mm in diameter [1]. "
What design feature allows for maximum line motion with minimal movement of the supporting components in a flexible hose assembly?," A typical assembly of flexible hoses is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]. ; <— FLEXIBLE HOSE SECTIONS tS GIMBAL : AXES F t+ R | | _77~ THRUST CHAMBER | The flexible hose sections shown in the preceding figure are located so as to achieve the maximum motion possible of the line with the minimum motion of the flexible hose sections. In addition, the entire wraparound lies in the gimbal plane rather than passing through it. "
What is the orientation of the third flexible hose section in relation to the gimbal system?,"The preceding figure illustrates a gimbal system mounted on the head of the thrust chamber for thrust vector control. The longitudinal axes of two of the three flexible hose sections are located in the gimbal plane. The midpoint of each of these two flexible hose sections is located on each of the two gimbal axes. The third flexible hose section is located in the vertical direction, to provide universal motion of one end of the line with respect to the other. "
What techniques are employed to restrict the movement of flexible hose sections and mitigate bending stresses?,"This method of locating the flexible hose sections limits their motions to the gimbal angles only, in order to reduce bending stresses and consequent fatigue. When the hoses are not stiff enough to resist motions caused by either mechanical vibrations or accelerations load, then clamps and support brackets are used [1]. Other arrangements for flexible hoses than the wraparound arrangement described above have been used, when lack of available space made it necessary to do so. "
What configuration is used for routing the flexible lines in the interface between the engine and the vehicle?,"For example, the flexible lines of the J-2 engine at the interface between the engine and  the vehicle have been arranged in a U-shaped routing configuration, with a section of braided flexible hose in each leg of the U, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1]. .

"
What is the maximum Mach number allowed for gas velocities in flexible hoses to prevent pressure losses and flow-induced vibrations?,Flexible hoses are sized so that the velocities of gases are kept below the value 0.3 of the Mach number. This avoids pressure losses and vibrations induced by the flow.
What factors influence the durability and performance of a flexible hose compared to a bellows in mechanical applications?,"The inner core of a flexible hose is subject to vibrations caused by the flow and by mechanical parts, as is the case with a bellows (see paragraph 7), the only difference being that the braid of a flexible hose restrains the corrugations to vibrate individually. Other considerations concerning pressure carried, resistance to corrosion, manufac- turing methods, and handling protection for flexible hoses are similar to those which have been discussed in paragraph 7 for bellows.. "
"What types of materials are typically utilized for the inner cores of flexible hoses in rocket engines, considering the extreme temperature conditions?","As a general rule, only metallic materials are used for inner cores of flexible hoses installed in rocket engines, due to the very high or very low temperatures reached in such engines. Some exceptions to this rule are cited below."
What is the primary reason for the higher cost associated with seamless tubes compared to rolled and welded tubes?,"The type most frequently used is the metallic, annularly convoluted inner core. The metallic, helically convoluted inner core type is not used in aerospace applications. Rolled and welded tubes or seamless tubes are used, but those of the seamless type are much more expensive. The welds of those of the rolled and welded type require X-ray and leakage verifications before use."
"What materials have been utilized for inner cores in Titan III engines, and what is the range of diameters used?","The engines of the Titan III have used successfully inner cores of both normal and carbon-impregnated Teflon® (poly-tetrafluoroethylene) in sizes ranging from 9.525  to 25.4 mm in diameter. On the S-IC stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, inner cores of Teflon® have been used successfully with RP-1 at a working pressure of 15.17 MPa. Inner cores made of Teflon® have also been used successfully for the airborne hydraulic system on the Centaur. "
What factors limit the usage of rubber in extreme temperature environments?,"Rubber has been used only for applications involving non-cryogenic or non-high temperatures. In addition, the quality of rubber is subject to deterioration with time.. "
What methods can be employed to minimize bending moments affecting flexible hoses?,"Bending moments to flexible hoses are to be considered, because the components adjacent to a hose are loaded. Low values of bending moments are desirable, because low bending moments applied to flexible hoses which cross the gimbal plane result in low loads applied to the actuators which gimbal the engines. Bending moments can be reduced by using lubricants applied to braid wires and to the other surfaces of the inner core. "
What effect does axial compression of an inner core have on the bending stiffness and weight of flexible hoses?,"An inner core may be compressed axially before installing the braid. This results in a higher number of convolutions per unit length and in a lower bending stiffness, but also in greater weight and cost of the materials. A compressed inner core also improves the ability of a flexible hose to withstand pressure impulses.. "
Explain why buckling stability is not a significant issue when designing flexible hoses. What role does the braid play in this aspect?,Buckling stability is not a concern in the design of flexible hoses. This is because the support provided by the braid for the inner core prevents buckling.
What material is used to create the woven cover that supports and protects the inner core of a flexible hose in rocket engines?,"The braid of a flexible hose is a woven tubular cover, which restrains the inner core against elongation and gives it lateral support and protection. The braid absorbs the entire separating load of a flexible hose. In rocket engines, the braid is woven of wire made of stainless steel."
What process is used to secure tubular braid sections to end fittings after applying tensile load to them?,"Tubular braid may be woven directly on the inner core of flexible hoses. Sections of braid are cut at a length slightly greater than the length of the convoluted inner core. A tensile load is applied to the ends of the braid section, and the section is attached to end fittings by brazing or welding [1]."
What is the required characteristic of a braid weave to ensure flexibility without wire binding or bottoming out in a hose design?,"The pattern of a braid weave must be such as to prevent the wires from binding or bottoming out, within the design limits of angular deflection for a particular section of flexible hose."
What determines the braid angle or helix angle in a flexible hose braid configuration?,"Typical configurations of braids used for flexible hoses are shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [1].

"
What is the significance of an angle of 5 at approximately 77/4 in relation to hose flexibility and strength?,The pitch is the axial distance taken by any given wire to make one complete turn. An angle 5 of about 77/4 (45°) is presumed to give the maximum flexibility together with good end strength and resistance to pressure for flexible hoses with metallic inner core [1]. . 
What is the approximate efficiency percentage of the second layer of braid when considering load distribution issues?,"Multiple layers of braid may be used to achieve greater strength. The second layer is assumed to have an efficiency (see below) of about 80%, due to the difficulty of obtaining a perfect distribution of load between two layers."
"What is the maximum diameter of tubular braid available, and what is the ultimate tensile strength of stainless steel braid wire?","Tubular braid is available in various metals and sizes up to 457.2 mm in diam- eter. The ultimate tensile strength of a braid wire made of stainless steel is about 827.4 MPa, but braid wires of higher strength can also be found [1]."
"How is the end strength of a braid determined using the total number of wires, strength of a single wire, efficiency factor, and braid angle?","The end strength Fg (N) of a braid can be calculated by using the following formula of [1]:Fz, =n F,,B. sind where n is the total number of wires in a braid, F,, (N) is the strength of a single wire in a braid, B, is the braid efficiency factor (whose values are 0.93 for an annealed wire, 0.85 for a hard-drawn wire, and 0.80 for a second layer), and 6 is the braid angle defined above."
What is the definition of the maximum pressure a hose can withstand without loss of pressure or fluid?,"The burst pressure is the maximum pressure which a hose can retain without losing pressure or fluid. The burst pressure p, (N/m’) of a bellows-type metallic braided hose can be calculated by using the following formula of [1]:"
What is the relationship between the end strength of a braid and the effective area of the bellows as described in the provided equations?,"Fz Pp = — 0 Ae where Fz (N) is the end strength of a braid defined above, and Ags (m”) is the effective area of the bellows, which results from T D2 Act = a : and D,,, (m) is the mean diameter of the bellows, such that D,, = (D, + D;)/2, where D, (m) and D; (m) are respectively the outside diameter and the inside diameter of the bellows."
"What does the notation ""(m)"" represent in the context of the elongation of a braid under pressure?","The elongation & (m) of the braid, when a flexible hose is under pressure, can be"
What variables are involved in the formula to calculate internal pressure in terms of wire characteristics?,"calculated approximately by using the following formula of [1]: é= Dit Act nEAy where p; (N/m”) is the internal pressure, ¢ (m) is the total length of one braid wire between its end connexions, E (N/m?) is the Young modulus of a braid wire, and A, (m7) is the cross-sectional area of each wire. The preceding equation includes no allowance for slack in the wires, and holds when the stress is within the elastic limit. "
What type of alloys are used in the flexible hoses of the Space Shuttle's main engines to combat corrosion?,"Braid wires are subject to corrosion. As a result of the experience gained for the main engines (RS-25) of the Space Shuttle, the braid materials for the flexible hoses used in those engines have been nickel-base alloys. . "
What are the two primary kinds of terminating structures implemented for small diameter flexible hoses?,There are two principal types of end construction used for flexible hoses of small diameter:
What are the two types of end constructions for small-diameter braided metal hoses categorized by temperature usage?,"(a) a welded-and-brazed type, used at temperatures from cryogenic to 478 K; and (b) an all-welded type, used at temperatures above 478 K. These two types are shown in the following figure, adapted from [1]. COLLAR BRAZE BURNDOWN WELD TUBE ADAPTER BRAID INNERCORE -\———. oo . -_- —__—-—_ HOLES FOR INSPECTION OF BRAZE PENETRATION (a) End construction for small-diameter braided metal hose (temperatures from cryogenic to 478K) BURNDOWN WELD “ a (b) End construction for small-diameter braided metal hose (temperatures above 478 K). "
What type of construction is essential for maintaining strength in high-temperature applications involving flexible hoses?,"By end construction we mean a juncture of inner core, tube adapter, and braid. The all-welded type is required at high temperatures, because of the loss of strength of the braze material at such temperatures. These two types have been used for flexible hoses up to 76.2 mm in diameter [1]."
What end construction is utilized for tubes with an internal diameter greater than 76.2 mm when exposed to temperatures ranging from cryogenic to 478 K?,"In case of tubes whose internal diameter (ID) exceeded 76.2 mm, another type of end construction has been used at temperatures from cryogenic to 478 K. This type (c) is shown in the following figure, adapted from [1].  BRAZE Cm (c) End construction for braided metal hose 76.2mmID and over (temperatures from cryogenic to 478K)"
What kind of assembly is applied in hoses intended for large diameter configurations in rocket engine applications?,"The type of construction illustrated in the preceding figure has been used in hoses of large inner diameters (88.9 and 101.6 mm) developed for the gimballing feed systems of the engines of the Atlas and Thor rocket vehicles. In such engines, the internal diameter of the tube was large enough to permit a lap weld of the pressure- carrier neck to the tube adapter [1]. Two further examples of end construction are shown in the following figure, adapted from [1].. "

What factors influence the bending moments needed for the deflection of braided metallic hoses?,"The moments required to deflect braided metallic hoses depend on numerous parameters, such as inner diameter, outer diameter, thickness of the inner core, number of plies, live length, number of layers of braid, number of wires and their diameters, and operating pressure. Data on the bending moments can be obtained from the manufacturers of flexible hoses or by test. Some typical values can be found in [1].. "
What is the purpose of the guide in relation to the flexible hose's movement and lifespan?,"A guide enables a flexible hose to bend, move, and operate in more than one plane without twisting, in order for the hose to have a longer service life. This guide has proved successful under severe conditions. Two independent bends are curved one  in a horizontal plane, and the other in the vertical plane. The guide provides a neutral length of hose which separates the bends and prevents interactions between them, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [15].. "
What was the outcome of identifying the minimal neutral distance essential for optimal functionality?,Determination of the minimal neutral distance required for proper operation led to
What is the role of the roller in the hose assembly at the inflection point?,"the identification of a single theoretical point of inflection, where the hose becomes free of the guide. A roller, for each hose in the assembly, is placed in this point. The inherent stiffness of the hose makes this point the point of inflection between the horizontal bend and the vertical bend. Each bend is curved in a single plane with no components of rotation or twist along the axis of the hose. "
What is the purpose of installing filters in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines?,"The arrangement shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [15], can be modified for other motions of the hose.  > ot Rhee agit eal 7 eae” Bris Nasi <= ae"" at a SS Sas ae an pia 1 ae} ‘gs pCi os” aeoa es a - a 2 a ae 7.9 Filters As has been shown in paragraph 1, filters are often installed in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines to retain solid particles of contaminants which may be contained in the fluids. "
What are the three primary sources of contaminating particles in fluid systems used in rocket engines?,"Downstream of filters, the size of the remaining solid particles is reduced to such an extent as not to affect the performance of components sensitive to contam- inants. Examples of such components are valves and actuators. According to Buck- ingham and Winzel [16], contaminating particles existing in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines are due to three principal causes, which are: e residual manufacturing debris in the tanks and in other parts of a fluid system; © contaminating particles in the on-loaded fluids; and © particles generated by the wear of components in normal operation. "
What is the process in which solid particles are captured on a single planar or curved surface during filtration?,"Generally speaking, as has been shown by Howell and Weathers [2], there are two techniques of filtration, which are briefly described below. One of them, called surface filtration, is accomplished by impingement and reten- tion of solid particles on a matrix of pores placed in a single planar or curved surface. Filtration occurs only at that surface, and the particles which are not stopped there  pass through the filtering medium with no further change in direction. "
What limitations does surface filtration have regarding particle size and surface area in the collection process?,"This technique of filtration is effective in collecting particles larger than the sizes of the pores, but not effective in collecting fibres and particles smaller than the sizes of the pores. Its capability of retaining solid particles is limited by the area of the surface which can be provided within a given envelope. Examples of surface filtration media are single-layer mesh screens, stacked washers, wound metallic ribbons, and sheets of perforated metals.. "
What is the primary mechanism of solid particle retention in depth filtration?,"The other technique, called depth filtration, is accomplished by impingement and retention of solid particles in a matrix of pores placed in depth. Sand is a typical example of a depth filtering medium, in which the filtering action consists of absorp- tion and entrapment of solid particles at random. Solid particles are retained not only at the surface, but also throughout the thickness of the filtering medium. "
"What is the mechanism by which solid particles are retained within a filtering medium, besides surface retention?","The particles which pass through a matrix of pores are forced to change direction in a tortuous path. Depth filters are effective in collecting solid particles larger than the maximum size of the pores and fibres. They can also collect a portion of solid particles smaller than the largest size of the pores, depending on the type and on the thickness of the filtering medium. Their capability per unit area of retaining solid particles is large, because the particles are retained not only on the surface but also throughout the depth of the filtering medium. "
What are some materials commonly used in filters that utilize depth filtration techniques?,"Examples of depth filtration media are multiple layers of mesh, wounded wire cylinders, stacked discs of paper, sintered granulated materials, multiple layers of cloth, compressed or matted organic or inorganic fibres, stacked discs of etched metallic sheet, materials of elastic foam with open pores, and stacked membranes [2].. "
What materials are commonly used for surface and depth filters in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines?,"In the particular case of filters used in fluid-carrying ducts of rocket engines, most surface filters are made of woven wire cloth, and most depth filters are made of stacked etched metallic discs."
"What are the two types of wave patterns found in woven wire cloth, and how do they differ in strand arrangement?","Ina filter made of woven wire cloth, the filtering medium is woven from strands of metal. A type of wave is plain square wave, in which the strands pass over and under each other in alternating sequence. Another type is twilled square wave, in which the strands pass “over two, under two” in a staggered pattern. In both cases, the resultant openings are square-shaped [16]. Woven wire cloth, also known as woven wire mesh, is woven on looms, by using a process similar to that used to weave clothing. "
What is the most prevalent crimping pattern used for interlocking segments in the construction of mesh?,"The mesh uses one or another of various crimping pattern for the interlocking segments. Square mesh, described above, is the most common type of mesh. The plain weave is the most common weave for woven wire cloth with a square opening in the plain weave. Materials used are austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. This type of filter is suitable for non-critical hydraulic, pneumatic, and propellant feed applications [2]. "
What is the primary function of the chemically etched face in the segmented washer-like components of the filter?,"The following figure, adapted from [16], shows a wire cloth pleated conical filter.  A : | A | SECTION A-A a 155.2mm An etched-disc filter is a stack of segments resembling thin washers. Each segment has one face chemically etched to provide a desired flow path, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [16], where all dimensions are expressed in millimetres.

What allows solid particles to traverse each segment's surface in a non-linear manner within the segmented structure?,"Etched DEAOETTT FASS ce Pt \ at ~~ ee Flow Flow Enter / Enter L seappes Particles The non-etched face of each segment in the stack is in contact with the etched face of the next adjacent segment, so that the etched areas form minute passages for the flow. The stack of segments is held rigidly by a supporting cage and is tightly compressed. The depth property of an etched disc filter is obtained by compelling  the solid particles to cross the surface of each segment through a tortuous path. "
What types of systems are compatible with an etched disc filter for effective particle removal?,"An etched disc filter can be cleaned by releasing the compression on the segments and back-flushing. This type of filter is suitable for critical hydraulic, pneumatic, and propellant feed applications. Recent advances in wire cloth filter technology have broadened the field of choice for critical applications. However, the etched disc filter remains the only filter made only of metal which can be used for filtering particles below 8 x 107° m [2].. "
What are the benefits of a filter design that eliminates central posts in terms of fluid dynamics and impurity collection?,"A full-flow etched-disc filter, developed by Caltech/JPL [17], has fluid passage- ways in a configuration which allows very low restriction of flow and has also stagna- tion areas for the collection of impurities. A filter housing without a central post has also been developed to improve the flow characteristics. The full-flow etched-disc filter produces a zero reversal of flow and a very low drop of pressure. "
What design feature of the etched-disc filter element enhances fluid flow while reducing interference from primary streamlines?,"A perma- nently sealed (welded) filter housing without a central post has improved the flow characteristics. The following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [17], shows an etched-disc filter element consisting essentially of a thin metallic disc with shallow, radially-disposed, etched, fluid channels incorporating stagnation areas located away from the main flow streams..

What is the purpose of the inner alignment tabs in disc-oriented systems?,"Fluid may flow in either direction.

What advantages do wire-mesh filters have over filters made of stacked etched discs regarding surface area and flow rates?,"Of various metals used for filters, stainless steel is the most common. Filters of the wire-mesh type have, in comparison with those made of stacked etched discs, the advantages of: © greater surface area with lower weight; and © capability of handling higher flow rates.Filters and filter elements are covered by the military standards MIL-F-5504B [18] and MIL-F-8815D [19]."
What role do filter cases play in hydraulic systems for aircraft?,"Some standard filter elements and filter cases used in hydraulic systems for aircraft are illustrated in the following figure, re-drawn from [2]. As shown in this figure, filter cavities can also be machined in the body of a component such as a servo-cylinder, a pump, or a regulator. er case provides structural support for a filter element."
What factors must be considered in the design of a filter case for optimal performance and maintenance?,"pump. gul: A filt provides structural support for a filter el t. The design of a filter case takes account of space available, easiness of access and service, pressure loss, fluid compatibility, and pressure and temperature in operating conditions.

What type of filter case allows for filter element removal without needing to detach from the piping system?,"The choice of a type of filter case depends on requirements of accessibility. The in-line filter case is the least accessible type of filter. It requires the removal of the case from the piping system before a filter element can be removed. The T-type, also known as pot type, is designed so that the filter element can be removed by removing the filter pot. The Y-type is designed so that the filter element can be removed through one leg of the Y, by removing a blank flange or a cover plate.. "
"Why should internal seals be minimized in critical propellant feed scenarios, particularly regarding material compatibility and particle generation during assembly?","The seal used for a filter is particularly important in case of mechanical vibra- tions. In critical propellant feed applications, internal seals should be avoided when- ever possible, due to compatibility of materials and generation of particles during assembly."
What components are employed to secure the filter element to prevent downstream migration of filter parts?,"Such devices as supporting cages, bolts, nuts, and O-rings are used to seal the filter element at its interface with the case. The seals or the locking devices used in filters are designed so as to avoid damages due to parts of filters which may migrate downstream."
What situation can lead to a high pressure difference indication in filters within systems transporting cryogenic fluids?,Some filters have a pressure indicator which senses abnormal high differences in pressure across a filter element. This device may sometimes indicate a high difference in pressure where a liquid and a gas flow intermittently. This may happen in ducts carrying cryogenic fluids.
What is the purpose of a by-pass valve in lubrication and hydraulic filters?,"Some filters used in lubrication and hydraulic ducts have a built-in by-pass valve, which opens and by-passes the filter when the difference in pressure across it exceeds a given value. This device is incorporated in the filter, because it is better in some cases to keep a fluid-carrying duct working with a contaminated fluid than to have a complete failure due to lack of fluid when the filter becomes plugged. "
What type of device is infrequently utilized in engines designed for short-duration operations due to limited contamination growth in filtration systems?,"This device is rarely used in rocket engines which operate for a very brief period of time, and therefore the level of contamination in these filters cannot grow appreciably during their operating time.. "
What are the methods available for cleaning a filter as described?,A filter can be cleaned in one or more of the following manners:  e back-flushing;A brief description of these methods is given below.
What is the primary purpose of reversing the flow direction in a filtering element?,"Back-flushing results from reversing the direction of flow through a filtering element, with consequent flushing of solid particles from the inlet side of the filter. This method removes loose particles, but not those which are tightly fixed within the porous medium. Therefore, back-flushing must be followed by other methods to restore a filter element to its original conditions of cleanliness."
What process involves the use of ultrasonic waves to create cavitation that aids in removing particles from a submerged filter element?,"Ultrasonic cleanliness consists in immersing a filter element in a tank containing a solvent solution, and applying ultrasonic waves to this solution by means of trans- ducers mounted on or within the tank. The ultrasonic waves produce cavitation on the surface of the filter element immersed in the solution, and this in turn loosens solid particles on the filter element."
What process enhances the cleanliness of a filter by removing loosened solid particles in the direction of normal flow after specific cleaning methods?,"Flushing a filter element in the normal direction of flow, after applying back- flushing or ultrasonic cleaning, removes the solid particles which have previously been loosened and improves the degree of cleanliness."
What process involves using a dry gas to eliminate moisture and residual solvent from a filter element?,"Purging consists in using a pre-filtered dry gas, such as air or nitrogen, which passes through a filter element to dry it and to also remove residual solvent which may be left by previous cleaning processes. Purging a filter element is often less effective than ultrasonic cleaning and back-flushing."
Why is it important to perform initial cleaning of a new filtration component before its use?,"Initial cleaning of a new filter element is necessary, because solid particles may have been introduced during manufacture and assembly of the filter into the filter element and also into the filter case."
What processes can enhance the cleanliness of a stainless steel filter element after assembly?,"Ultrasonic cleaning, flushing, and back-flushing may be combined together to reach a desired level of cleanliness in a filter element.Cloth elements made of stainless steel can reach a higher degree of initial clean- liness by applying acid passivation after assembly, or by annealing the assembly in an environment of hydrogen [2]."
What factors determine the selection of a specific filter type for a particular application?,The choice of a particular type of filter to be used for a specific application depends on:
What is the maximum allowable size of particles in a duct system for fluid transportation?,e largest size of solid particles which can be tolerated by the components of a fluid-carrying duct;e amount and type of solid particles which may be contained in a fluid during the service life of a given rocket engine;© maximum loss of pressure due to the presence of a given filter; and
What factors must be evaluated to determine the maximum size of solid particles that can enter sensitive components in fluid systems?,"The maximum allowable size of solid particles in a given component (for example, a valve or a servo-actuator) can be determined by evaluating the clearances or the sizes of narrow passages in the given component which are sensitive to contaminants. For this purpose, it is necessary to determine the possible malfunctions of the given component caused by the entrapment of solid particles carried by the fluid.. "
What factors complicate the estimation of solid particle quantities during the operational lifespan of mechanical components?,"The amount and the type of solid particles during service life is difficult to deter- mine, because of uncertainties in the prediction of: (a) amount of solid particles which remain after cleaning a given component and its filter; (b) amount of solid particles which are carried by the fluid; and (c) fluids and temperatures in operational conditions, which may differ from those of the tests conducted in laboratories.. "
What factors should be analyzed to decide between external and integral filter installation in a duct system?,The maximum loss of pressure due to a given filter and the space available within the given duct can result from a system analysis and a trade-off study to determine whether it is more advantageous to install a filter mounted externally to the component to be protected or a filter forming an integral part of the component itself.
What term describes the maximum size of solid particles that can pass through a filter and indicates the level of protection for downstream components?,The largest size of solid particles which can be transmitted through a filter is expressed by a parameter known as filter rating. This parameter measures the degree of protection which a filter provides for downstream components.
What does the maximum particle size rating indicate regarding the solid particle dimensions permitted beyond a certain filtration device?,"Several types of filter rating are specified by filters manufacturers.One of them is the maximum particle size rating (MPR), which is the longest dimension, in microns, of any solid particle allowed downstream of a filter."
What does the absolute filter rating indicate regarding the size of particles a filter can retain?,"Another type of filter rating is the absolute rating, also known as glass bead rating (GBR), which is the size, in microns, of the largest hard spherical particle (i.e., glass bead) which would be removed by the filter under steady flow conditions [16]. In other words, the definition of absolute filter rating considers all solid particles to have spherical shape, and requires a filter to retain all solid particles whose diameter is greater than or equal to a specified value. "
What particle dimension is considered in the absolute rating for filter transmission?,"Therefore, the absolute rating takes account only of the second largest dimension of any solid particle which can be transmitted through a filter.. "
What is the relationship between a filter's nominal rating and its absolute rating in terms of percentage removal of solid particles?,"Still another type of filter rating is the nominal rating, which assesses the ability of a filter to remove a specified percentage (in either count or weight) of spherical solid particles or graded dust whose size is equal to or greater than the value defined by its absolute rating. Therefore, the nominal rating of a given filter is always less than its absolute rating."
How can the maximum particle size rating be assessed in a laboratory setting?,The maximum particle size rating can be determined by test. The test is conducted by using a readily identifiable contaminant with particles of various sizes and shapes. A procedure for determining the maximum particle size rating is described in [16].
How is the absolute rating of a filtration system assessed through testing with artificial contaminants?,"The absolute rating of a filter also can be determined by test. A test is conducted by filtration of an artificial contaminant (glass beads) under specified conditions, as described in [19].The nominal average rating of a filter can be determined by means of a mercury intrusion test, which is described in [20]. "
Explain how the pressure required to force air through a pore relates to the pore's diameter in the context of a specific testing method.,"Maximum particle size tests are not practical for acceptance testing of production filters. The glass bead test is a destructive type of test, and therefore is never used as an acceptance test. However, correlation of a glass bead test with a non-destructive bubble-point test permits verification of absolute rating for production filters [1]. The bubble-point test is based on the fact that, for a given liquid and for a given size of pores with a constant wetting, the pressure necessary to force a bubble of air through a pore is inversely proportional to the diameter of the pore. "
How is the diameter of the largest pore in a filter determined using liquid wetting and air pressure?,"In other words, the diameter of the largest pore in a filter can be measured by wetting the filter element with a liquid and then measuring the pressure at which the first stream of bubbles is emitted from the upper surface of the filter element, when air is introduced to the open end. The pressure at which the first stream of bubbles emerges is taken as a measure of the diameter of the largest pore. "
How is the constant related to the relationship between pressure and diameter determined in experimental settings?,"The value of the constant of inverse proportionality between pressure and diameter is determined experimentally. Further information on the bubble-point test can be found, fir example, in [16, 21]. The bubble-point test is covered by the standards ISO 4003:1977 [22] and ARP 901A [23].. "
What factors must be considered to accurately predict the amount of solid particles in suspension for determining filter area requirements?,"As has been shown above, a filter is necessary to reduce the size of solid particles carried in suspension by an operating fluid to a level which cannot cause damage to critical components of a duct. The determination of the filter area required for this purpose is based on an accurate prediction of the amount of contaminant which can be expected for any given application. The problem of accurately predicting the actual degree of contamination is still open. "
What factors could contribute to discrepancies between measured and forecasted levels of contaminants in industrial processes?,"So far, there appears to be no correlation between the actual and the predicted amounts, sizes, and types of contamination [1]. The reason of this may be the variation in techniques used in manufacturing and building components and assemblies.. "
What types of contaminants are typically employed to evaluate the effectiveness of a filter in a specific application?,"In this state of things, for the purpose of demonstrating that a filter of sufficient area has been provided for a given application, a specified amount of contaminant is required to be retained by the filter, without exceeding some maximum difference of pressure between its inlet and outlet. The contaminants most frequently used are AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts. These test dusts are Natural Arizona Dusts supplied by General Motors Phoenix Laboratory and classified to specific particle-size distri- butions by the AC Spark Plug Division of General Motors Corporation [1]. "
What is the purpose of AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts in evaluating filter performance under flow conditions?,Further information on AC-Fine and AC-Coarse dusts can be found in [24]. The two dusts named above provide a baseline material for evaluating the ability of a filter to retain particles on its upstream side under flow conditions. Buckingham and Winzen [16] gives further information on tests which were conducted to determine the tolerance of various filter materials to contaminants for both gaseous and liquid flow.. 
What are potential sources of residual contaminants that can accumulate in a filtration system?,"Residual contaminants, that is, contaminants remaining in a filter after cleaning, may slough off and pass downstream of the filter. As has been shown above, such contaminants may accumulate in a filter during its manufacturing process, or be introduced there by the operating fluid, or be generated by the wear of mechanical components. "
"What factors influence the accumulation of impurities during the processes of production, integration, and evaluation of components?","A cleaning of a filter removes a part of contaminants from the filter, the amount of this part depending on the accuracy of the cleaning process. Since this process is expensive, sometimes more expensive than the manufacturing process, then it is desirable to reduce the amount of contaminants which accumulate during fabrication, assembly, and testing."
What materials commonly exhibit the phenomenon of media migration in operating fluids due to contaminants from the filter element or its structure?,"It is also desirable to reduce media migration, that is, the presence in the operating fluid of contaminants coming from either the filter element or the filter-supporting structure. Filter materials subject to media migration are sintered porous metals, pressed paper, matted fibres, glass fibres, sintered plastic, fired porcelain, bonded carbon, and bonded stone [1, 2]."
What procedure involves subjecting a filter to extreme temperature variations followed by vibration before flushing it with a specific fluid?,"One of the most common tests for media migration combines thermal shock with vibration. In this test, a filter is exposed to its highest service temperature for a period of time and then to its lowest service temperature for an equal period. This procedure is repeated several times. After this thermal shock, the filter is caused to vibrate at frequencies of service for a given period of time. After testing, the filter is flushed with a given amount of fluid (usually 500 ml of either Freon TF or some ozone-friendly substitute for it), and the fluid is collected and passed through a 0.45 membrane pad. "
What method is used to identify individual particles in a sample taken from the analysed membrane pad?,"The membrane pad is then analysed for particles identifiable as material coming from either the filter element or the filter-supporting structure. When all of the particles are non-metallic and the filter is made entirely of metal, then no media migration has occurred. When some of the particles are metallic, then further analysis is required, and the filter material must be distinguished from residual contaminants [1]. Individual particles taken from a representative sample of the pad can be identified by microscopic examination.. "
What is the relationship between pressure loss and volumetric flow rate in filter elements?,"The problem of determining the loss of pressure Ap through a filter as a function of its volumetric flow rate qg is difficult to solve. In case of a filter element of the surface type, the pressure loss across the filter medium for either fine or coarse mesh is small in comparison with the pressure loss at filter entrance or exit."
What method is suggested for determining the relationship between pressure loss and volumetric flow rate?,"In practice, the problem indicated above can be solved by tests which make it possible to plot curves of pressure loss against volumetric flow rate."
What is the condition for flow in which the pressure loss of a fluid through a porous medium is described by the Kozeny-Carman equation?,"One of the formulae which can be used for determining the properties of a filter is known as the Kozeny-Carman equation [25], which is briefly discussed below.The Kozeny-Carman equation expresses the pressure loss Ap (N/m°) of a fluid which passes through a porous material, such as a packed bed of solids. This equation, which holds only in case of laminar flow (Re < 1), can be expressed as follows"
What is the relationship between fluid velocity and volumetric flow rate in a packed bed system?,"L @b 8 “~ @D2 6 A where L (m) is the total height of the bed, jz (kg m~! s~!) is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity of the fluid, @, is the sphericity (see below) of the particles in the packed bed, D, (m) is the diameter of the volume equivalent spherical particle, é is the porosity (the fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume) of the bed, jx (m/s) is the mean velocity of the fluid at right angles to the layers of the bed,  qd (m?/s) is the volumetric flow rate of the fluid through the bed, and A (m?) is the cross-sectional area of a layer (the cross-sectional area of the solids plus the cross- sectional area of the pores) of the bed. "
What is the effect of increasing mean velocity or volumetric flow rate on pressure according to the given equation?,The minus sign in front of the right-hand side of the preceding equation takes account of the loss of pressure with increasing mean velocity or volumetric flow rate.. 
What is the relationship between the sphericity of a particle and its surface area compared to that of a sphere with the same volume?,"By sphericity ¢, of a particle in a packed bed we mean the ratio of the surface area of a sphere having the same volume V,, as the given particle to the surface area A, of the particle, as followsAccording to this definition, the sphericity of a spherical particle is unity, and the sphericity of any non-spherical particle is less than unity."
What equation related to flow through porous media is derived and exemplified in source [26]?,A derivation of the Kozeny-Carman equation and worked examples for its application can be found in [26].
What equations are used experimentally to assess pressure loss through a filter based on its flow rate?,"Other equations (Darcy-Weisbach and Hagen-Poiseuille) found experimentally to determine the loss of pressure through a filter as a function of its volumetric flow rate are discussed in [16]. The equations cited above provide an excellent means for evaluating filter area requirements. However, they do not consider pressure losses at entrance and exit [1]."
What are some examples of fluids utilized for testing filters instead of cryogenic or corrosive propellants?,"Filters are not tested for acceptance with the same fluids as the propellants used by rocket engines, because of difficulties due to testing with cryogenic or toxic or corrosive propellants. Some fluids used for tests are Freon TF, hydraulic oil, trichloroethylene, water, isopropyl alcohol, and methylated ethanol [1]."
What is the primary force acting on the flange ring that causes it to undergo rotation under different loading conditions?,"7.10 Design of a Flange Joint A flange joint of a type frequently used for a rocket engine is shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [3].  rE Flange ring Weld joint F, _ EO : ‘ S\ \ 1 = Centroid \ | | | i) _\ ¥,| ofthecross \ F, D.

"
What role does bolt force play in the operation of a raised-face type flange joint?,"The dashed line in the preceding figure indicates exaggeratedly the counter-clockwise direction of rotation of the flange ring illustrated in the preceding figure. Some flange joints of the raised-face type shown in Sect. 7.4 and also in the following figure, re-drawn from [28], have a small gap to eliminate or reduce stresses in the peripheral part of the flange ring. A flange joint of this type is sealed by the bolt force which squeezes the gasket. Seals used for flange joints will be described in Sect. 7.11. . "
Where do bending moments induce the highest stresses in a flange joint connected to the cylindrical surface?,"The stresses resulting from the bending moments reach their maximum value at the point Z, where the flange connects with the wall of the inner cylindrical surface of the duct. The bolts used for a flange joint are frequently pre-stressed in tension, in order for a compressive stress to act on the gasket. This compression seals effectively the joint and avoids leakage."
What is the relationship between the forces on a circular arc and the minimum bolt loads according to the mentioned source?,"Let us consider an arc of circle of unit length (1 m) passing through the centroid of the flange cross section.

"What is a static seal commonly used in flange joints, and which types are typically employed for this purpose?","common type of flange joint, but not to all types. Other types of flange joints havebeen illustrated in Sect. 7.4. Methods of calculation for such types of joints areGaskets are used as static seals. The following types of gaskets are generally used"
What type of gasket tends to concentrate loads at bolt holes and is sensitive to thermal gradients?,"Gaskets of the annular-ring type are the most widely used for bolted flanges. Pressure-actuated gaskets use the internal pressure of the fluid as an aid to the sealing action. Full-face gaskets generally require higher bolt loads than is the case with annular-ring gaskets. Full-face gaskets are scarcely tolerant to thermal gradients, and have a tendency to concentrate the loads at the bolt holes and at the portion of the gasket outside the bolt circle. "
"In what service conditions are these gaskets typically not recommended for use, particularly concerning temperature and pressure limits?","These gaskets are largely used for non-critical service conditions, but rarely used for service conditions involving either high (above 505 K) or cryogenic (below 122 K) temperatures, or relative pressures above 2.068 MPa [2].. "
What factors must be considered when determining the appropriate thickness of a gasket for a flange joint to ensure effective sealing and joint stability?,"A gasket used for a flange joint should be thick enough to provide adequate conformity to the surfaces of the metallic parts of the joint, because thicker gaskets are generally better suited to conform to surface scratches and to compensate for sealing waviness. However, the same gasket should be thin enough to provide stability to the joint and to prevent blow-out when residual stresses are low and internal pressures are high [2].. "
"What materials are used for O-rings in gaskets, and what temperature range do they operate effectively over for extended durations?","Gaskets of a common type have O-rings made of elastomeric materials, which are natural or synthetic rubbers. They are used over a temperature range going from 211 to 505 K for long periods of time, and at higher temperatures for shorter periods of time [11]. At low temperatures, the elastomeric O-ring is installed between thin foil films, or is coated with indium, which remains ductile at such temperatures, as shown in the following figure, re-drawn from [2].. "
How is the elastomer positioned for installation before it conforms to the flange in service?,The initial seal is obtained by compressing the elastomer to the desired position of installation. The pressure on the flange ring in service causes the elastomer to conform completely to the flange at the leak path.
What is the required percentage range of squeeze for elastomeric O-rings to prevent damage and leakage?,"Elastomeric O-ring gaskets can be used over a wide range of pressures and are high reliable when installed properly. Incorrect installation can cause damage or improper squeeze or extrusion to the elastomer, with consequent leakage. The squeeze required to prevent damage while at the same time preventing leakage due to insufficient pressure ranges from 8 to 32%. O-ring extrusion and consequent nibbling of the elastomer occur when the clearance between the retaining members permits the elastomer to be forced into the clearance. "
What methods can be employed to prevent the trapping of elastomers during pressure decay in technical applications?,"When the elastomer becomes trapped, it is nibbled or sheared off when the pressure decays. Extrusion can be prevented by combining properly clearances and hard elastomers [11].. "
What are the applications of elastomeric materials in the context of sealing and structural components?,"Elastomeric materials for flanges can also be used in moulded-in-place seals, which are flat plates having elastomeric inserts moulded into machined grooves, as shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11].BOLT HOLES ——— NS = aoe —>& SEAL WEB RETAINING PLATE"
What is the primary mechanism that contributes to the sealing effectiveness of elastomer-based devices during operation?,"In these devices, the initial sealing action is due to the compression of the elas- tomer, and the subsequent sealing action is due to the pressure in service, which forces the elastomer against the flange at the leak path."
What benefit does the thickness of a metal plate provide in relation to the elastomeric component of a seal?,"A moulded-in-place seal has the following advantages over a conventional O-ring: e the thickness of the metal plate controls the amount of squeeze on the elastomericportion of the seal, thereby permitting the use of flat-faced flanges on both sidesof the seal, and making it unnecessary to machine an O-ring groove in one of the flanges; and"
What advantage does the lateral installation between two flanges provide for large and cumbersome hardware?,"© itis easier to install in large and cumbersome hardware, because it can be installed laterally between two flanges. "
What type of seals have been effectively utilized in the fuel system of the F-1 rocket engine?,Moulded-in-place seals have been used successfully in the fuel system of the F-1 rocket engine [11].
"What are the advantages of using metallic O-rings in rocket engines, particularly in relation to space limitations and mating surface rigidity?",Metallic gaskets can be used at both cryogenic and high temperatures. These gaskets require high seating loads and are scarcely apt to follow flange deflection. Metallic O-rings are used in rocket engines particularly where the flanges or the mating surfaces are very rigid and connected with ample bolting [11]. Metallic O-ring perform satisfactorily in these conditions and offer the advantage of small cross sections where space is limited. They can be either Teflon®-coated for use at cryogenic temperatures or soft-metal plated for use at high or cryogenic temperatures.. 
What materials are used for the soft filler in the manufacturing of specific gaskets that consist of a stainless steel ribbon?,"Spiral-wound gaskets (see Chap. 5, Sect. 5.8) are made of a V-shaped ribbon of stainless steel wrapped spirally with a soft filler of either graphite or Teflon® between the turns, as shown in the following figure, adapted from [11].TEFLON FILLER (BETWEEN CONTINUOUS STRIP) STAINLESS STEEL CONTINUOUS STRIP (SPIRAL WOUND)"
"What are the challenges associated with using gaskets in high-temperature environments, particularly in relation to flange integrity and sealing?","These gaskets were used extensively in rocket engines for both cryogenic and high (up to 811 K) temperatures. They need heavy, rigid flanges and high bolt loads (of the order of magnitude of 5 x 10° — 7 x 10° N per metre of circumference). The high loads at the edges of the steel ribbon caused marring of the mating flanges and reduced the possibility of achieving a good seal when the joint was re-assembled [11]. "
In what applications are spiral-wound gaskets preferred due to their cost advantage despite potential leakage?,"Spiral-wound gaskets are still used today where leakage is tolerable, which happens in isolate engine locations and in large diameters, where they have a cost advantage over more sophisticated machined seals.. "
What are the temperature and pressure limits for pressure-actuated seals when used with hot gases?,"Pressure-actuated seals were originally developed for cryogenic temperatures. Later on, they were modified for hot gases. They have been used extensively in the J- 2 and F-1 rocket engines. Their range of use includes cryogenic fluids at temperatures  as low as 20 K and pressures as high as 27.56 MPa, and hot gases at temperatures up to 1033 K and pressures up to 10.34 MPa [11]."
"What type of sealing material requires internal pressure to expand and create a seal, distinguishing it from elastomeric forms?","Pressure-actuated seals are more complex to manufacture and more expensive than those using elastomeric materials, and therefore are used only when those of the latter type cannot meet the requirements. The cross section of a pressure-actuated seal expands due to the internal pressure exerted by the fluid carried in the duct, and this expansion generates the seal. The deflection of the sealing face is larger than the deflection permissible in an elastomeric material. "
What type of seal is described as being pressure-actuated and has a cantilever shape?,"Therefore, a flange using a pressure-actuated seal can be less rigid and heavy than one using an elastomeric seal. A pressure-actuated seal of the cantilever (U-shaped) type is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [28].. "

What is the typical shape and function of a seal that is located in a flange recess and supported at specific points to achieve sealing under pressure?,"The U-shaped seal sits in a recess of the flange. The cross section of this seal has a web and two legs, each of which has a small tip at its end. The U-shaped seal is supported at the lips and at the outer surface of the web. The internal pressure of the fluid pushes the lips toward the inner surfaces of the flange, thereby exerting the sealing action. The dimensions of the cross-section of the seal are usually much smaller than the inside radius of the seal, and the legs of the seal are much more flexible than the web [28]. The cross section of a pressure-actuated seal may also be C-shaped (open O-ring) instead of U-shaped.. "
"What benefits do pressure-actuated seals provide compared to traditional O-rings in terms of resilience, weight, external load distribution, and sealing efficiency?","According to [28], pressure-actuated seals have the following advantages over elastomeric or metallic O-rings: e high resiliency in seal and low clamping pressures, which result in lightweight flanges;e external load taken by other components of the connector;¢ use of available pressure to increase sealing; and"
What adaptation allows certain animals to mitigate adverse impacts caused by extreme temperature variations?,"e reduction of negative effects of extreme temperatures, due to the ability of the seal to “follow through”."
What temperature range can metallic seals withstand when utilized for cryogenic fluids?,"Pressure-actuated seals used for ducts carrying cryogenic fluids are generally coated with Teflon® or with metallic plates. Metallic pressure-actuated seals have been employed in the RS-25 engines of the Space Shuttle. They have been used for cryogenic fluids at temperatures as low as 20 K and pressures up to 62.05 MPa, and also for hot gases at temperatures up to 1255 K and pressures up to 42.75 MPa. "
What materials are utilized for the metallic seals to ensure a soft sealing interface?,"The metallic seals have been made of Inconel® 718 plated with silver or gold to provide a soft sealing material at the interface [11]. A groove-type seal, shown in the following figure, adapted from [11], is used to save weight and provide a small envelope.. "

What is the role of the metallic spring in the design of seals for cryogenic fluids?,"Plastic spring-loaded seals have been developed for fluids at cryogenic temper- atures. Such seals are made of a jacket of plastic material, usually Teflon®, which covers a core of metallic spring. The spring provides the force required for the initial seal and also the forces necessary to compensate for dimensional changes resulting from thermal expansions and contractions. These seals are pressure-actuated, and therefore the sealing load increases with pressure.. "
What type of seals are typically more suitable for use in rocket engines with storable propellants due to compatibility issues with elastomers?,"Plastic spring-loaded seals are less reliable than metallic pressure-actuated seals at cryogenic temperatures, and are therefore used principally in rocket engines fed with storable propellants, when elastomeric materials are not compatible with such propellants. A seal of the radial type used for a flange is shown in the following figure, due to the courtesy of NASA [11]."

How does the application of axial load during installation affect the seal's reusability?,"In this seal, the axial load acting on the flange is converted to a radial load acting on the interface through a toggle action within the structure of the seal. The two pieces of the flange joint are designed to confine the outer diameter of the seal, so that radial interference occurs and plastic flow of the seal takes place when an axial load is applied to the joint during installation. The plastic flow makes the seal not re-usable, but the two pieces of the joint are re-usable after installation of new seals. "
What is the range of axial load per unit length needed for the installation of a specific type of seal?,The magnitude of the axial load per unit length required to install a radial seal ranges from 87500 to 105000 N per metre of circumference.. 
What is the function of a bellows joint with restraining linkage in a rocket engine's oxidiser pump discharge?,"A type of radial seal, the Conoseal® (described in [30]), has been used in some rocket engines (such as the M-1 engine and the Titan engines) and for some rocket vehicles (such as the upper stages S-IV and S-IVB) to seal flange joints for ducts carrying cryogenic propellants, storable propellants, and hot gases [11].  712 Design of a Bellows Joint for a Flexible Duct In the present paragraph, we consider a bellows joint with restraining linkage for a flexible duct at the discharge of the oxidiser pump used in a rocket engine.
